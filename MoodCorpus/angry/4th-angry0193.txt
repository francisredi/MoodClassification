Viscious Rumor
I hate rumors, and Ill hate this rumor even more if it turns out to be true. The Big Boss Man, of the company I currently work for, is opposed to business casual...or so the rumor goes. He loathes it in all its non-collared glory. He thinks its tacky. It ruffles his executive-paid coiffed hairdo. Or so the rumor goes. 
Said rumor is this. We lucky Corporate Whores-In-Training will receive a bonus this coming year. Big Boss Man wants to be a bit generous because we will need the extra money to buy our new Business Dress wardrobe. Is it true that "the industry" is going to start swinging back to those days when everyone had to dress up to go to work??? I am old enough to remember those days and cringe. Panty hose and dresses and heels and dry cleaning bills! Gawd I hate heels..bad for the back, killers in the snow, and I cant remember the last time I wore a dress..possibly when I got married over two years ago. 
Oh well as a peon I can do little about it except fret and gossip with co-workers. Luckily I still have a great boss. Thank the cosmos for that!
