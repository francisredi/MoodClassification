Hoe-bitch-cunt...
is in our room, packing up her shit.  I've never been so angry in my life.  She is, in fact, moving in with "the love of her life"--the girl she met three weeks ago.  How fucking beautiful is that?  Bitch cen't even let me leave--she's gotta beat me to it.  Low-down.  LOW.  Oh--AND she admitted that she in fact didn't love me but asked me to marry her and to move to California with her because she "didn't want to hurt my feelings".  Dude, FUCK her and this arrogant pity bullshit that comes from some inflated sense of her inportance and the premise that I would rather--that ANYONE would rather--be with her even if she doesn't love them--because, you know, she's so fucking great and all--than know the goddamn truth before they pick up their whole fucking life and move it to some shithole town in SOuthern California.  you have GOT to be kidding me!  Who does that?  I hope that this particular "love of her life" shits all over her right when it hurts the most.  Pray with me, ladies and gentlemen.  pray with me.  Ha.  
I'm joking, sort of.  I AM angrier than I've ever been and I can't say that there is anything remotely compassionate or forgiving in me right now--that, if it comes, will have to come much later.  I was fighting with myself at first, trying to go with lovingkindness, with some kind of understanding--but it's not true yet and I'm not there yet and I think maybe it's okay.  Maybe I get to just be really PISSED for as long as I need to and write a bunch of fabulous, angry shit and move on with the impetus of anger behind me.  I am trying to believe it's okay.  Fucking low-down cunt, man.  those are some humdinger lies to tell, you know?  How do you LIE about asking someone to marry you?  Ugh.
