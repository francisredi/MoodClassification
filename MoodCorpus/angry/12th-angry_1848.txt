I HATE BEING STOOD UP.
I HATE BEING STOOD UP.  I HATE HATE HATE IT.  I don't understand WHY it is so hard to just call me and say, I'm not going to make it tonight, sorry.  WHY WHY WHY don't people call?  WHY WHY WHY is it so fucking hard to just have enough respect for someone else to not stand them up?  

fuckin' a.  i found the PERFECT guitar player for my band, just what i was looking for.  and he's a FLAKE.  this is the THIRD TIME he's conveniently decided to just NOT SHOW UP.  WHY WHY WHY is the perfect bandmate a flake?  WHY?  WHYYYYYYY?  UHHHG!  At least Tuesday he had the decency to call at 4 to cancel for 8pm...  would it have been so hard to call me again?  So I could go on and do things i need to do and not wait for a call/knock on the door?  UHHHHGGGG!!!!  

GET A FUCKING CLUE PEOPLE, THIS IS NOT HOW YOU TREAT OTHERS!!!

It is nearly IMPOSSIBLE to put a band together in Nashville, TN, supposed "Music City."  Another thing i JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND.  

AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGG.
