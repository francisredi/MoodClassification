any one wanna hear my beef? any one? any one?
so mom complains i never see her, that i always go to dad. i go to hang out with dad because he actually hang out with me...that and mom drives me nuts. so, the other night, she expressed to me that she's here nomatter what. she'll buy me groceries, a car, all sorts of stuff. i told her it wasn't nessessary, but i'm glad to know i have that back up. so then this morning, i'm hung over, starving (we had no food at all), and am actually dizzy due to hunger. I call up mom, explain my situation, just wanting to come over to her house and eat something. hell, i'd even make food for her too. so goes "Do i have to?" great. then, she goes "can't your father pick you up?" ugh, i thought it was selfish. i'm less angered now, cuz i'm not hungry. but it pissed me off.
please, let us not get into the multitudes of drama that's fuckin eatin me alive. ugh, i hate it. i hate it i hate it i hate it. 
I hate being mothered by friends. that drives me nuts. there's a reason i dont live with my mother! fuckin aye!
oh, yeah, and christian/crow. if you are hitting on me, and i'm blatently fucking turning you down, and trying to push you away from me, TAKE A FUCKING HINT! DO NOT PERSUE TRYING TO KISS ME! UGH! Jesus!
oh yeah, another one. if i'm flirting with a guy, and gilrs, you can spot that, any chick can spot a chick flirting with some one - dont' fucking hang on him! do i do that to you? no! ugh.
right....i've got more beef, but i'm just pising myself off, so i' going to stop.
