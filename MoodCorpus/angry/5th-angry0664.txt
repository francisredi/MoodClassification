Hate
That's right folks, another rant-entry about how I don't understand how some people are allowed into college. Today in Geography 115: World Landforms, there were these 3 or 4 really annoying and preppy girls sitting behind me.  I heard snippets of their conversation, but that was enough to make me want to kill myself. First of all, the leader of the stupid girls (as in, she was the stupidest) was asking her friends if she should be taking this course in the first place.  Here are some mini-breakdowns of their conversations:

Leader: "I dunno guys, because I saw Geography 010: Intro to Physical Geography, but I'm not sure which one will be easier." 
Friend 1: "I think the hardness has something to do with the numbers." 
Friend 2: "Yeah, and this one has a lab on Fridays."
Leader: "There's a LAB in here!?" 
Friend 1: "So that's why the Friday class is twice as long as usual!"
Leader: "WHAT?!"

Leader: "Also, guys, I need to take another math class, which one should I take?"
Friend 1: "Well you hate math, so take Stat 100, it's really easy."
Leader: "I dunno, everyone talks about Calc, so I think I should take that, even though I had to drop out of Math 22 because it was so hard."

Leader: "I hate how there are so many foreign TAs, like there was one Spanish TA and one Asian TA in one of my classes, and you know, I could barely understand them because they don't speak English good."
