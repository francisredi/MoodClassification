I thought Mixed Messages were Reserved Only for Girls
I hate men. Especially those with names starting with "J." I don't deserve to have my head fucked with, not now, not 3 years from now, not ever. I don't appreciate being called as a backeup. "Just in case." I am not just a blonde with big boobs. I am more. I am better. Sure, it's nice that a guy you find attractive has reciprocal feelings. Not so nice when he has those feelings for any blonde girl with big boobs. I go to the bathroom and come back to witness a make-out session between my last major crush (not including M because he's a douchebag) and this girl he just met? Sure, accents are sexy. I'll give him that. But if you want a girl that's not the one you just flirted heavily with, the one that is not the girl that you KNOW has liked you since day 1, 3 summers ago, then don't hit on her then kiss someone else. She won't like it. She'll hate it. 


I think it's time to go cry myself to sleep now. I hate men.
