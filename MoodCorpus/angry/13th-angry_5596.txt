Lesbian Drama.
I just called my mom and she's really upset. Last weekend her and her girlfriend broke up after almost 3 years. For anyone who don't know, my mom is lesbian. Anywho, I tried to get her to talk to me because the other day she was bashing her left and right. Today, she went to pick up her things and they "talked". They "might" get back together "someday". Who knows. But anyway now since they talked. She is all upset and don't wanna talk about it. She snapped at me when I asked if she wanted to talk. When she was little her dad would smack her for saying anything so now she just dont talk about things at all. Ever. Either she won't say anything or she just says "nothing, I don't wanna talk about it." Oh well, I tried. I really want her to be happy but because of her fear to tell anyone how she feels is what makes her miserable inside. And what makes her drink. I really hope this is out of her system when we fly home, or it will not be a good visit. And to be honest, I hated her girlfriend anyway. She was controlling (still is) and was a cunt to my little sister. That is what made me the maddest. I hope she don't get back with her. Ugh.
