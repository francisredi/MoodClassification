I hate my family
I'm pretty sure my parents are the two most retarded and selfish people on the face of this effing planet.  I hate them.  I personally am fairly certain that it is my b.c. that is making me feel ill all the time.  I also am certain that this will be gone within a week.  I explained this all to my mom--who the entire time acted like I was retarded because I know from the internet--and she got mad.  She told me if I miss one more day of school because I am nauseated, I am grounded from my phone and computer for a month.  This is because "there are options to make me feel better and I am not taking them."  What the fuck?  This was even after I explained that the doctor told me to my face that finding a good b.c. that agreed with you was Trial And Error.

And also (oh it gets a lot better, kids.) my dad was like "Your mom is not an idiot...*pause as if to say "like you are"... she knows about the pill.  She was on it for a loooong time." and my mom just shifted her weight and looked like she had been caught doing something really really wrong and she knew it.  So basically when I was first looking for an option to make me not cramp, she KNEW that b.c. would help me and said nothing.  She knew every single goddamn thing I said to her about b.c. was true and she acted like she didn't.

Basically I am moving out when I am 18 and I am NEVER coming home.
