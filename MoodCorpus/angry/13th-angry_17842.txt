I hate everybody
I hate Shianne and Brandon for giving me a hard time every time they work together and not knowing when to stop.  

I hate John for not telling me that he had to work late tonight.  Otherwise maybe I could have made arrangements for the dogs to be taken out and fed.  As fas as I know, they've been in that crate without food or water or a chance to use the bathroom since I left at 4:30.  

I hate Lisa for getting herself fired and ruining my morning off.  

I hate the Orkin man for not catching the damn mouse that's running around in the office.  

I hate whoever gave me this damn chest cold that I haven't been able to shake for a month and a half.

I hate Chris for burning something in one of my pots so abd that I had to throw it away.  

I hate Van for not answering my IM's until like 2 days later when I've forgotten that I've IM'ed him in the first place.  

I hate Andy for telling me that he had sex 5 times in one night.  That's just more information than I need.  

Right now part of me hates the Marine Corp for taking Jennifer away from me for 3 years.  I've had the crappiest of crappy day and the only person I want to vent to is on the other side of the globe.
