Hurray for feeling sorry for myself
At two o'clock this morning I was still awake. I was convinced that I had Miningits because I had a stiff neck and headache. So I IM'd the only person who was up (Crystal) and we walked around campus until four! Then I went to sleep, waking up was horrible! I could actually feel the vibration from my phones alarm. School was nothing special, I went to the death clinic, I'll have to wear flip-flops for a while. I have a normal case of athlete's foot, but my body reacted to it very oddly. It really hurts to walk and I had to get a prescription at Walgreens, and since I have no car I had to look for a ride (fortunately I got one)

 I got mad at Angel because she wanted to use my computer for homework, but she spent four minutes on German, declared that her eyes hurt, and began to get on Myspace and Xanga, and I'm like WTF! So when I had to go to Choir practice, I took the computer away from her. Of course she got upset, and tried to convince me that going to Myspace was the only way to help her get her homework done. I love Angel to death, and I don't mind doing her favors, but i don't appreciate it when I lend her my computer so she can write a paper and then she calls me the next day and says that she didn't get it finished (read:started) and if I tell her no she goes on about how possesive I am with that thing! While I'm on the angry rant, I'm angry at my roommate for no apparent reason other than the fact that he has this weird ESP that says "Go into the room, Marshall is looking at porn, but don't stay for a long time in the room, be there for like four seconds and then leave and then return to the room for four seconds and then leave and this will continue for hours and hours on end!"

URG! I FEEL LIKE EXPLODING! *Begins playing My Chemical Romance* (he was listening to Andy Bell)



i hate being bitchy, i really do, i just don't feel well.
