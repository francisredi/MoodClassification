erghhh
ok so i left an important refund check in my apartment so came back today to get it (I'm on spring brek) and 1) my door was open....i never leave my door open, NEVER and i specifically remmeber watching my sister close it when i asked her to when she picked me up on friday....and my bed is made but the pillows are arranged diff so this leads me to conclude 1) obviously people have been in my room, 2) someone either slept in my bed EWWWW, or felt it necessary to take it upon themselves to rearrange my pillows.... ughh MY SPACE. I hate people going in my space!!! Especially without asking and just no!
ugh.
and i had planned on coming back and doing work since i cant always concentrate at home but now i'm too angry to work. i got on my comp tho cuz i like it better than the one at home. 

so far spring break has been relaxing, sleeping n such. i need to get cracking tho....A LOT OF WORK. not fair!!

o well, always my bday to look forward to i guess...
Cake :)



i hate roommates.
