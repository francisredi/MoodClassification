i am livid. absolutely livid. never in my life... here just read...
i am disgusted. you HAVE to read this article. it is the most abomminable, horrendious, revolting thing i have EVER read. i have NEVER been so ashamed of christians in my life. i feel like a primordial oozing slug just being associated with them even as distantly as i am. there are not words enough to discribe the extreme contempt in which i hold these loathsome creatures that dare pollute our air with their misquoted bible passages and uninformed unintelligent thoughtless mindless . how DARE they go around preaching the "word of god" when THEY - those tics, thoose snakes, thoose diseased rodents - do THIS! they see every one elses "sins" but their own. everyone ELSE is wrong but us! everyone else sins but us! everyone else is immoral, corrupt, and profane BUT US! and their basic message is just so very very aweful in and of itself that they deserve nothing but the strogest contempt anyone can conjure. here see for yourself:

is it not horrid? is it not hypocracy!? does it not cause the very core of your being to riot up in protest!? does not it go completly against your beliefs of what is good and right and just!?

i admire the bikers. it is near impossible for me to esteem them more. in truth i hold them in as high a regard as many of the heroes/ heroines in my books. and in many cases even more.

i realize i have been wordy and "overly" dramtic and that some may think i am using a rather large amount of hyberboly in order to get my point across. but i assure you i am doing no such thing. i truley feel this strongly about the wrongs these "people" - if you can even give them such a high title as human - have commited and am thourghly disgusted by their abhorant behavior. this truly is the only way to get my anger out and i only want in make its being stronger.
