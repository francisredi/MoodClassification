stuff i cant control
so the weekend wasnt bad... immanuel basketball tournament... thats all i can say. umm i cant say no to heather so i am definetely coaching immanuel cheerleading next year. which i am actually excited about. a little aprehensive at the same time... its just gonna be different from northwest so ill just have to get used to it.

so yesturday dan braught up musical and my heart just sank into my stomache. im absolutely dreading it. in fact i couldnt sleep last night cuz i was stressing about it big time. it sucks cuz i want to be suportive cuz i know its sommin he loves but at the same time i know that im gonna hate hearing about. and i dont like him being there with out me. i dont want to hear about it, but at the same time i would rater hear about it and know whats going on rather than being in the dark... im really nervous about him being there with all those people tho, i know that im gonna end up getting jealous or mad or both and he wont have a clue as to why...


ahhh i hate stressin about stuff i cant control
