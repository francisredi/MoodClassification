I'm in a wicked foul mood. I got into a disagreement with my boss today (who's wrong but is only a victim of the lame-ass school district I'm in). My students sucked ass and I actually yelled today; the first time all year. They're all going to fail their 9 weeks test because they're lazy little fucks who haven't done a thing all quarter. I'm fucking burned out from doing the stupud after school program. No wonder no other teachers wanted to do it. The little brats think just by showing up and having social hour they're going to get their elective credit. Que sorpresa fuckers. Man, I haven't been this foul in a long time and there aren't enough beers in the fridge to mellow me out. 

My daughter is never Kinsley; she's shark-boy, or some other character. I don't play pretend. And it's getting on my fucking nerves already. You're thinking it's cute that she does it, and it is for about 5 minutes, but SHE'S ALWAYS PLAYING PRETEND. SHE IS NEVER JUST KINSLEY PLAYING WITH DOLLS. She takes a movie character but changes shit at her whim so I'm never playing right. And she always tells me what to say yet when I say it she makes something up and then I don't know how to respond to her "satisfaction" because SHE'S ALWAYS CHANGING SHIT.
