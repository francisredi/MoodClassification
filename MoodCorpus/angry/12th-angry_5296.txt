Too damn honest
So the other night my boy and I went bowling. I went to the bathroom and on the way back found a $20 bill on the floor. I pick it up, look around and think about putting it into my pocket. Then I get a wave of virtue and go to the front desk and tell the guy I just found some money on the floor. He asks how much and I tell him and he says "give it to me". I'm kicking myself the whole time. The guy pockets it and I'm fuming. I watch the desk the whole time I'm there and don't see him give it to anyone. I am so freaking mad because 1) I'm a poor college student and could really use the money and 2) because the guy just pocketed the money! I mean if someone actually went back to claim it then I would feel good but the fact this guy took it makes me so mad. Its like stealing. On the way out I ask him if anyone came up and he goes "yeah" I look at him and say "oh really I've been watching the whole time and didn't see you give it to anyone" and he shrugs and turns away. This ruined my whole night. This guy made me so mad. My boyfriend and dad told me basically that I'm an idiot for turning it in cause if I dropped the money someone would have pocketed it and they wouldn't have turned it in.
