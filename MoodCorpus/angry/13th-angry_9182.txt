Giving Gay Blood
I've remembered what I was going to rant about, and it had to do with American Idol.  I have something better, though.
The Company is doing another blood drive.  There's pink flyers posted everywhere.  I already know I'm not Allowed to give, because I am a man who has had sex with another man one or more times since 1977, or I am a man or a woman who has had sex with such a person.  Why this date was selected, I've no idea.  Perhaps this was the year that God created The AIDS to kill The Gays because we were getting too uppity with our Agenda.  But here's the important bit.
It's man-specific.
The wording is "A man who has had sex with another man", not "A person who has engaged in same-sex intercourse".  They don't hate The Gay, they just hate the gay MEN!  What kind of hypocritical crap is that?  They don't want fag blood, but the lesbian shit is top-notch?
I'd love to give blood, but I ain't gonna lie to do it.  They obviously don't need my assistance.  They don't want my dirty cells.
