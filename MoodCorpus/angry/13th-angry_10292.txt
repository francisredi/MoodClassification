ME!
uhmmmm....... It's my first journal since I'm a little kid..... When I was little I really like having a journal but when I found out that I'm not the only one who reads my journal, I stopped!!! Its just so depressing the thought that someone knows what your thinking when its suppose to be private!!!! Anyway, now I'm back with the journal thing!!! I don't care anymore who ever reads my journal!!!! Even If the person who reads it is in my journal!!! I just don't care anymore!!!!! I want to just freaking express what I'm fucking feeling!!!! because the truth is that I can't express them.... I'm PLASTIC okay?!?! I'm a pretender!!! Everyday I fucking pretend!!! I pretend that I'm okay!!! I pretend that I'm happy when the truth is that I'm not!!!!! I'm just not!!! How can I be okay?!?!?! I want to be happy its just that I can't!!!! I mean, how can I be happy when I have so many fucking problems?!?!?! My dad left us to be with his own fucking family!!!! my mother is such an annoying egocentric beyotch!!! I can't concentrate on my studies!!! some of my friends betrayed me and my most biggest problem of all is...... I fucking hate myself!!!!!!! Oh yes, I do!!!! I mean, how can I not hate myself?!?!?! I'm everything I never wanted to be!!!!!! Its just so hard!!!!!! I can't take being me anymore!!!!! I hate me!!!!!!!
