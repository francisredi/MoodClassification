is it just me, or did people get a LOT more evil over the past two days?
i think last week, i began to realize how good people could be, but yesterday and today, and even  a little toward the end of last week, i've been seeing all of these horribly evil things show themselves in people. tiny sin-like actions, commited for what appears to be no reason. as hard as i try to convince myslef that people are good, and that whatever drives them to do these things is beyond their control, i can still never fully justify what they've done. 
that's why i'm beginning to remember why people are so quick to forgive one another. in every act of evil, every act of hate, people see a spark of something they've felt, or something they want. grudges are reserved for the weak minded, highly confident bastards, who know nothing but their own pride. they have it set in their minds that they can do no wrong, and they are quick to judge, quick to hate, and quick to remember this hate.
no one is good. no one is evil. some people just hold to these concepts for the sake of having beliefs. reminding themselves daily of their meaninglessness, and giving themselves purpose with their confidence of something bigger than themselves.

god do i hate some people.
