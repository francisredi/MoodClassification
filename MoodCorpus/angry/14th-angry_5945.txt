behind my attic door...&hearts;
there are birds fighting or killing eachother outside
or maybe they're like mating hahaha
oh shit. anyways...

i am so confused.
boys confuse me.
i'm terribly disappointed.
one day its all i miss you so much, i want to see you so bad
and he realizes that he's messed up by being with someone else
when he should have stuck with what he thought in the first place
like shit, move to this town and i promise you, you'll never have to be alone again, but no
now its like it used to be before we said we liked eachother
with so many days of not responding
and nothingness really 
because theres no way to reach him
i hate distance
i hate not being able to travel that distance
i hate not having him travel that distance
i hate having to feel confused about whats going on
and if anything can happen between us
because this is what i think about every single day
for almost three years now, its been on my mind
and its honestly, truly, definitely killing me without him here
FUCKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK
