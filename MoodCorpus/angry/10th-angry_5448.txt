well, well, well
Well today has been quite event ful with all that has been going on around me. I guess I'll start at the beginning. Beth's boyfriend called me to give me back my FOB ticket so now like 3 weeks away from the concert I've gotta find someone to go with me. YAY! And Kimmi im's me last night and is all about Dan once again I fuckin' hate that. Dan finally grew enough balls to tell her he likes sunshine and Kimmi is still all about it. And ha ha for her cuz she can't find a babysitter for tonight! And now she's thinking about going out there Saturday. if I drink with her I'm liable to piss her off on purpose that's just how I am. The last time I drank I was all over Dan and told her about it and she got all snotty and pissy with me. So fuckin' fine then. ARG I hate people like that. They irritate me. Dan's my best friend and I'm his and she just needs to back off on that or she's gonna do the one big no no that no one ever does and piss me right the fuck off and she's not gonna like what becomes of me being pissed off. Well enough venting for right now.

Love always,
Kris
