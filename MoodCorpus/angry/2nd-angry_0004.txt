election woes
So I'm torn.. I don't know how to vote

I don't like the liberals because... well.. I think they've had a long enough run

i don't like the NDP because, well, Jack Layton = a jerk (a friend of mine knows him personally, her father was a big to do in the NDP party) and I disagree with their idea for creating an "inheritance tax".. i mean common, people are suffering enough after a death, finaces are hell as it is arranging a funeral, and now the NDP wants to screw it up even more by taking their share? screw you, you selfish self rightious bastards

I like the green party, but they will never be in a position to do anything.

but the biggest problem is this, I like the conservatives, I always have.. but i hate, HATE, HATE Harper. I doubt that I have to explain my reasons, everyone knows what he stands for.

so what do i do.. do i vote green party again because they are a group i like, but know all the while that it is effectively a wasted ballot?

Or do I vote liberal just to try to keep the conservatives out? then suffer through more of their petty shinanigans.. 

I'd rather hold my foot in a deep fryer then cut it off and serve it to my dog before I'd vote ndp
