This is SOOOOO four years ago.
I hate my school. I aslo, more specifically, hate the people I hang out with there. (Except you Kendall. You dont count in this rant.)

They all hate eachother, and spread rumors about eachother and its so ANNOYING.

Lindsay hates Ian who hates lindsay and me, and lindsay hates alex who hates lindsay and ian who hates garret who hates lindsay and Ian who hate alex and me, who hates LAME,LAME,LAME!

Its gotten so out of control LAME that I dont even know who hates who anymore. Now they all just agree with whatever someone has to say about someone, until they see the someone, and tell them what the person said about them, and then the other person says stuff about the other person, and then everyone picks sides, but keeps switching them and cant decide who they like more because they hate them both.

I dont say JACK SHIT about anyone, unless they say something bad about me TO MY FACE. 

What started this rant, was earlier today, I was sitting on the couch at school, and Ian says "So brittany, I hear you only like lindsay because she buys you stuff." I say "Not true." He says "Three people have told me, that you told them, that you only like her because she buys you things." I say "I've never said that."

Ian needs to fuck off and stop lying.

Before I left school, Ian and Garret were telling Alex about all the shit Lindsay says about him, and Alex was actually really surprised. I was too, Me and Lindsay talk all the time, and I've only heard her talk shit about Alex when her and Alex were in a fight. Which was a while ago. 

Everyone is being a bitch to everyone else, and I just HOPE that no one is spreading rumors about me. I really dont want to be involved in this 12 year old shit.

So immature.
