Just a quickie.
I am getting freaked about the parole hearing. I don't want to give the bastard the satisfaction of seeing me cry. That would be so humiliating. But when I talk about the fact that the man took away the only person who loved me unconditionally I get mad. When I talk about the fact that he tried to make me perform oral sex on him I get mad. When I remember him trying to penetrate me, a 7 year old, I get upset.  When I talk about the fact he tried to smother me with a pillow, I get mad. When I talk about the multiple times he stabbed me and later when he slit my 4 year old sister's throat, I get emotional. Maybe if I get emotional, it might help my case.
When I talk about laying underneath my sister's bed, 4 feet from my bloody, dying mother, I get upset. When I remember that I felt I might die that night, I get upset. There is so much of that night that is nightmarish, jarring, blood everywhere.
I wish I could forget. 
It is so much, too much, for so many people. To hold something so horrid, so scary and yet so real inside you for so many years, it's hard. I don't think I ever told a guy the whole entire story. They'd blank out, look away or change the subject. 
Sometimes, I just need to talk about it. It's not something I'm going to "get over". Sometimes, there are things that are just so traumatic that you cannot move on.
But I am going to use my pain for good. To help other people. I need to channel this pain into good. And that's what I will do.
For I am the mighty warrioress, and I can kick some ass when I need to. 
I just need to channel this warrioress when I go into that parole hearing.
