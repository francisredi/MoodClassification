I hate writing ethics papers
Really, its an exercise in controlling my temper. Writing an ethics paper about the Newchurch guinea pig farm closure. Trying not to write very angry letters to the 'animal rights activists' *coughterroristscough* who are too illiterate to spellcheck their webpage. If justice exists, they'll all come down with fatal respiratory diseases.

Don't look at me like that. I'm serious. If there's a better way to do medical research, I'm all for it, but I will not volunteer myself as a test subject, and I don't see them lining up outside Oxford, offering to trade themselves for an animal, either.

Terrorist actions are WRONG, and I see that the animal rights activists merely bitch about the media calling them that, and not condemning the 'activists' who took that course of action. 

Ter-ror-ist n - Somebody who uses violence or the threat of violence, especially bombing or kidnapping, to intimidate, often for political purposes.


I don't know what firebomb attacks, cutting electricity and phone lines and STEALING THE BODY OF THEIR DEAD RELATIVE translates into in their mind, obviously not something worse than breeding guinea pigs. 

I hate writing ethics papers.
