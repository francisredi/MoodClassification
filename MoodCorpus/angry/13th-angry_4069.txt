Thin envelopes
I didn't make it into my first-choice college.

I'm pissed off.  Yes, really am.  Not so much because I didn't get in, but because now I have a choice between profoundly disappointing my parents or going to a close-minded bullshit school where I have a full scholarship, which is my only choice.

Education really does all come down to money.  It's why I stayed in the terrible school I'm currently in (because we couldn't afford to hire a tutor; because we couldn't afford any of the nicer private schools; because I was too emotionally unstable for a public school).

I need to look at what options I have.  Really, the only thing I want is to get up in the morning and not have the overwhelming sense of INEEDTOGETOUTOFHEREINEEDTOGETOUTOFHEREINEEDTOGETOUTOFHERE that I have every morning now.  I could travel (I have no money I hate buses planes cars sleeping in unfamiliar beds), I could go to another school (I don't even know what I want to study), I could work (I hate work I am not qualified for any jobs), I could just hang around the house (I get bored over the weekends I feel like a slug it's easy and it kills my brain my ambition my talent), I could work on an apprenticeship (I don't even know what I want to do), I could just go to the conservative Chrstian school my parents favor (I'm gay I'm Pagan I'm ethnic I'm too tired of being the "missionary" for the liberal/GLBT/alternative religions).  

I'm confused and angry and crying and basically every single other eighteen-year-old in the Universe right now.
