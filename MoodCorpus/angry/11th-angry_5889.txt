i'm so sick of all of this shit. It is just so annoying all the time. there is nothing to do here. I mean seriously, everyone ditches on you when you want to go out, and everyone seems to just blow you off. If youd don't want to talk to them, they don't wont be talking to you. you go out of your way to just hang out with someone and then blow you off with some lame excues. Thanks guys, i appreciate it all. (this does not pertain to Angela because she is sick) I hate the fact that everyone fucking disappears on the weekends. there is nothing to do. i'm fucking alone all the freaking time. i hate it. I HATE IT. all i wanted to do was go out this evening, and yet, wow, no one wants to go and well, where i was going i was told i shouldnt go. Fine fuck all of you. I'm so sick of this shit. i'm fucking trying to get out so that i can meet more people, meet people that are different than just in my little circle of friends, but there is no where to meet people. I wanted to go out and party, but yet, it seems that there is no point in that at all. freaking great. THanks Nelly, for just deciding to stay in, Angela for being sick (not that she could help it) and fuck you Twink for not realizing tha ti didnt care about the fucking party i just wanted to hang out. Fuck your stupid boyfriend drama that just makes you bitch more and more and not realize the shit that is just in front of your face. Fuck you all for just going off and being like that. I'm so sick of it. 

I just wanted to get the hell out of this fucking room. THanks for the help.

Fuck you all.
