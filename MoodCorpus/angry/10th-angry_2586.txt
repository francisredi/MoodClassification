Fuck. FUCKITY fuckfuck.
I hate this. 

Mom tries to call, and ends up calling Laura to tell me to call her, because GUESS WHAT! Our PHONE is cut off! After that MOTHER FUCKING BASTARD told me he PAID the phonebill! That ass, he hasn't fucking touched it since October; his excuse:  "Oh, I don't use the phone."   "I didn't know I had to pay YOUR internet on there." "You and Mom don't help me enough, I have more fucking bills than just the phone!"   

That Stupid ballknocking mother fucker makes more than $2500 a fucking MONTH! If he wasn't so goddamned FUCKING busy coking up and smoking POT every GODDAMNED day then he'd have a goddamned CENT left!  And when I asked him what happens to my $400 a fucking month, he wouldn't answer me, rather he said "Oh, you don't pay enough I guess."  that's bullshit. BULL.SHIT. 

Mom's moving out, the second she gets a chance, and I'm sick of this bullshit. I almost hit him today. I ALMOST fucking backhanded that stupid fucking mouth right off his face. *Fume* I need to go do something, angry. x_x; Scrawl death-scenes on paper or something, because I'm so mad right now I've got a headache, and just.. GOD. *blares music* 

I hate him. I fucking hate him.
