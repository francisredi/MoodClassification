~MOODY!!!!~
Well, today I seem to be very moody. Maybe it is my hormones kicking in. I hope that is it. Although I am very upset with someone and it has been building up for a while. I dont want to say who but well, I am just very upset. This person thinks they are better than everyone else in just about every aspect of their life. But I know that I am much happier than this person is. I have a wonderful husband. We are getting along great. There is a lot of things going on of late. I have found out that I am having a little boy. Josh is really excited. I just hate the way this one person acts. Although this person has always ticked me off but I never blow up at them because I tell myself that this person is just like that and although I dont like a lot of the things they do I never blow up. I never hesitate to tell this person when they do something I dont like but I dont ever really fight with this person. But I am tired of over looking all of the conceitedness and the way they act like they are better at everything. IT TICKS ME OFF!!!But no one else seems to know. I want to call and complain to my husband but I am sure he is doing a million other things so I had better not. I just hate all of this with a passion. How am I supposed to act Christian when I stay ticked off all of the time. Time to go!
