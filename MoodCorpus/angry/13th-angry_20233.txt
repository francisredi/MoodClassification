GET.ME.OUT.
One of my biggest pet peeves is door slamming. It's so unnecessary! Just close your damn door normally. It's not that hard. That said, I hate my neighbors. I don't hate much, but I really hate them. They slammed their door continuously for a couple of months (everyday, mind you) before we went over and asked them not to do that because the noise is disruptive and the shaking knocks the stuff on the adjacent wall. They said that the way they shut the door is normal and that everyone does that. So not true. They continued, we complained, and when they continued not to listen, we took it to the HOA. The security guard went and talked to them, and when she told them that the complaints were from two different sets of neighbors (hooray - it's not just us!), they were surprised. When the security guard said that if the complaints continue, they'll be fined, they were shocked. I truly wish I could have seen the look on their faces. Anyway, this helped matters for awhile. But the door slamming is back. It's so freakin' annoying. I can't wait to move out. Funny. Usually kids want to move out of their parents' home to get away from the parents. I want to move out to get away from the stupid neighbors. *sigh*
