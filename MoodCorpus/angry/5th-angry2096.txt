STOOPID LJ STAFF
LJ is annoying

They have FORCED me to change my password because they BELIEVE it is to easy to guess. That is not only annoying but totaly STUPID

IF I want an easy to guess password perhaps thats because I DONT WANT TO FORGET IT. MAYBE we all don't like remembering passwords like A1234bbCCdddQFZbettegammadelta BUT that might be to easy right. Its stupid! I have half a mind to pull my LJ off the air and move to BLOGGER or something else, a Journal sysyem that ALLOWS me to choose which ever password I damn well wish!

*Growls* this just totaly angers me, I have the right to have what ever password I like, I followed the rules, had to have a number cant be based off an english word yadda yadda yadda it had all that, then I get some dumb message saying I have to pick a new one and I didnt have a choice BUT "we think you'll agree that security is more important" BAH! what are they gonna do break in and read me  ZERO private journals or post fake journals, wow get real its not like my friends don't know the diffrence!

*sigh* Live Journal  I DEMAND OLD password BACK. I have sent a signature ANGRY e mail to the LJ staff and I will continue to send ANGRY e mails either till they Block my ISP or kick me off. EIther way its fine, If they DONT give me my old password back I will move to BLOG Spot ot something like that.

I may be over reacting but sometimes you need to over react to make a point, besides...its the principle of the thing, NO ONE bardges in and FORCES me to change my password!

*gets his boxing gloves on* Im going to fight this!
