it sounded like a cloak, trailing along the ground
i despise not being able to focus. all day ive had to fight. i feel so fucking terrible when mrs hight just GIVES UP on us and OH MY GOD livejournal autosaves drafts. thats not the point though. and in gov, mrs doughty threw me a few glares because i was doodling on my notes instead of paying attention. 
is it that i dont' care?
naw.
its that i've got a thousand other things i'd rather be doing then trying to stuff things in to my head. i mean, i like school well enough. i like my teachers and my classes. 
whatever.

im curled up in my chair listening to harry potter and reading ghost stories. i had a whole family of vampire sims because you fucking move a vampire in and guess what the bastards do? just guess, i dare you. if they aren't kept entertained every fucking moment of every fucking day, THEY TURN AROUND AND BITE RANDOM SIMS. bastards!

i have nothing more to say. 

LMAO GOD I HATE NOT BEING ABLE TO MOTHERFUCKING FOCUS.
