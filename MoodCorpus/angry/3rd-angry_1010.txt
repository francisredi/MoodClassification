parents suck.
i hate my parents. really. well my dad. he's like.. the biggest asshole to me. my mom is generally pretty nice to me. The other day my dad was a bastard when he found out that karley was comming over. So christmas eve and christmas day while noone was here he wouldnt let me ont he computer because i needed to bond with my fucking family who were just sitting htere fucking mad at the gay toys that didnt work.

Then today, i said can i go to the mall with alley and jess? he just said no. flatout fucking no because he doesnt want me at the mall anymore. THE MAN SUCKS. he really fucking does. what's wrong with the god damn mall? its a MONDAY! nobody goes to the mall on a fucking monday! what the hell? Like, really, i hate him. He wouldnt even do me the decency of opening his fucking bedroom door to tell me that i couldnt go. he just kept making his fucking immature witch sounds. 
whatever. its nto that bad i'm just venting because i'm pissed that he never lets me out of the house. he's trying to kill me. i dontk now why. i dont.

well he's bribing me with buying rhapsody again now. thats what happens if it shuts me up. well, its gonna so i'm done. 

i confuse myself. i hate myself.
