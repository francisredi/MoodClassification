Fuck the world.
I am so angry right now. My mom's car had to go in the shop so she's taking mine tomorrow. And hey guess what? Beth gets screwed over and nobody gives a fuck!!

I hate taking the bus. I absolutely despise it. Guess what I'm probably taking tomorrow? The bus. Jess doesn't have to be in until the second exam tomorrow so she's leaving later. FUCK THE WORLD.

And guess what else? Me and Rachel were supposed to meet Kelly and Ashley from work at the Willow Grove Mall after school. THAT'S NOT HAPPENING. Now I have to take the fucking bus home, and then walk to Joseph's in the fucking cold. I hate the bus. I hate the cold. I hate the world.

My parents made me take Kev to guitar tonight. I did. I only complained once and it was jokingly. So I sat in the cold fucking car for 45 minutes while he went to guitar and froze my ass off (wasting gas periodically to get warm), and then decided hey, let me be a nice sister. I'll take Kev to McDonald's before we go home. So I treated him to McDonald's and felt like a good sister for once, and as soon as I get home my mom says "Oh so you didn't get us anything?" and doesn't let it go.

That's the last time I fucking to anything nice for anyone. I always get shit about it and I'm tired of it.

FUCK THE FUCKING WORLD.
