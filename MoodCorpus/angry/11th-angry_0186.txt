Nice shoes...wanna fight?
Why don't people even try to make an effort to do stuff?  I'm not expecting much, but I was surprised when I got absolutely nothing out of people that I assume are able to make it through a day without help from another person.  These are people who are living on their own, in college, without someone waking them up everyday to get them off to school.  So why, then, can't they make an effort to help out other people when they're asked?  I don't know either, but it happened to me and I'm very pissed off about it.  It seemed like unless they were going to get in trouble for something, they just didn't feel like doing it.  Well guess what?  You're in trouble now!  I am a raving lunatic when I get pissed, and as of right now, I'm pissed.  I don't think that there are very many people out there that are happy to be around me when I'm mad at them, and I could probably name two dozen who downright hate me when I'm angry about anything.  Why couldn't they just make an effort?  Beats the fuck out of me.

Furthermore can I just say how odd it is to me that I get all hot and bothered when people are mad at me?  I'm not talking about my roommates or other girls, but when it comes to men, it is my spot.  Kisses on the neck are great, and I love the occasional and very rare gift of flowers or jewelry, but I cannot control myself when they get mad at me.  It's craziness.  I think it's because it shows me that they don't care if I want them to settle down, and that is one of the biggest turnons in the world.  I hope and pray that I'm not alone in this very peculiar turnon, but I have a strong feeling that not that many women like to be yelled at as much as I do.  Maybe it's some perverse sign that I like to be dominated, and I'm not going to deny it.  Whips and chains might be a little too much, but bitch me out for telling you what to do, and I'm all yours.
