AP - 1 hour, 41 minutes ago
QALAT, Afghanistan - Police killed four people Wednesday as Afghans enraged over drawings of the Prophet Muhammad marched on a U.S. military base in a volatile southern province, directing their anger not against Europe but America. The U.S. base was targeted because the United States "is the leader of Europe and the leading infidel in the world," said Sher Mohammed, a 40-year-old farmer who suffered a gunshot wound while taking part in the demonstration in the city of Qalat. "They are all the enemy of Islam. They are occupiers in our country and must be driven out," Mohammed said.

Ok, I'm DONE...just annoyed how EVERYONE blames us for every damn thing that happens and THEN when disaster strikes, they are standing there with their hands out...makes no sense to me and pisses me off!!!!
