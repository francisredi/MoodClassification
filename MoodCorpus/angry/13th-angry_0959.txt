And so it continues
I found an apartment yesterday that definitely fits my needs. I've been searching, but nothing quite fit. Then, on a blind hunt, I found Nottingham Place. It's awesome. Full-size modern gym, comfort suites for guests, spacious new floor plans, washer and dryer in unit, limited access gate, huge pool, basketball courts. Do I sound happy? Because I should. I'm picturing my awesome apartment decked out in cool gear. Niiice.

In other less happy news, my anger has not abated concerning a certain copy editor. The blistering rage is gone, but the simmering malcontent has only gone full throttle. She still hasn't said a word to any of the reporters. BUT, the current city editor spoke with her and found out she realizes we're all angry, but doesn't feel the need to try and fix the problem or speak to us. AND she wants to take over tomorrow without EVER SPEAKING TO US. Does this not sound wrong? Does she wonder why I want to scream at her and don't really speak to her unless forced to? Oh God, my blood pressure is skyrocketing.

Talked with my boss today about getting a raise. A nice, fat raise. None of that crappy $50 shit. I'm talking thousands of buckaroos in my bank account. I think he got the message. We're discussing terms tomorrow. I'm signing a lease tomorrow. Hell yeah, bitches.
