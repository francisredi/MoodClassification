No one is trust worthy!
I HATE BEING LIED TO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
HATE IT, HATE IT, HATE IT!!!

Even silly little, trying to save your feelings lies,  I mean whats the point?  Oh ya I am gonna feel more hurt by knowing your honest feeling or opinion about something then I will by knowing you are lying to me!
GUESS AGAIN!!!!

I dunno are my standards a little too high here?  I am asking too much?  Is it really that difficult a thing to accomplish people?  Maybe you will bruise my ego a bit by telling me the truth,but, no you will not destroy me if you are honest about who you really are and what you are all about.

You might run the risk of altering our friendship, this is possible, but this is a risk we take everyday simply by conversing with people.  And trust me you are doing FAR more damage to our friendship by not being upfront with me.
The funny thing is I can be fairly accepting of people and their quirks or faults or whatever you want to call it when I know what they are because the perpetrator is willing to expose those traits maybe even discuss them or display them with pride.  Btu when they are insidious hide their true self, their true identity or motive, that's when you fall way down in the respect and acceptance department with me.
