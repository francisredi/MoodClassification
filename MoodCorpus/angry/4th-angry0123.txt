David Lied!
OMG! He lied to me again! I can't believe it. I'm so tired of being made a fool of. It pissees me off so bad. And it makes me even more mad that it isn't even about big shit! It's about little shit that doesn't even matter that much. So if he'll lie to me about shit like that; what else will he lie to be about? I'm so mad. What the hell do I care if he dips? I just don't like being lied to. Plus to top everything else off...I go to the doctor to have a pregnancy test run. I don't know what we're going to do if I'm pregnant. I mean; I would be really happy, but if he is lying to me all the time...what am I soposed to do? Regardless I love him to death and I don't have the heart to leave him. I've tried several times, but I just can't. 
On a better note, I got my room clean yesterday. I mean CLEAN CLEAN!!! Thank God! It really needed it! My closet is packed now. It's all organized and everything, but I have way to many clothes. I tried to upload a pic today but it wouldn't let me. I guess there is just something wrong with the site! It's crazy. Anyways...I'm mad so I'm going to get off here. Write more later! xoxo Nik-Nik
