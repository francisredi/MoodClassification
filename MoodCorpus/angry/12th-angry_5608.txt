Hitting the Fan, all at once
Some days I really hate my life.  Now is one of them.  It's always when the baby decides to wake up JUST as I decide to go to sleep.  No sleep makes me cranky.  And makes me lay in bed hating that I can't sleep, and that everything else is going wrong too.  Every mistake I've made comes back to haunt me on these days.  especially those mistakes that are making themselves evident currently.  Getting married, getting divorced, agreeing to a custody arrangement I HATE so that my kids wouldn't have to go through a fight, losing my job, losing another job, being entirely unable to successfully GET a job that's not fucking teaching.  All stupid shit that's coming back to haunt me now, thanks to the goddamned government.  It makes me wish there were fewer arenas for the government to stick their noses into the lives of its citizens.  

As long as I don't have to deal with "people", I enjoy life.  As soon as I even THINK of having to deal with someone about money, I want to hurt, maim, or injure someone.  I used to have things together.  I don't feel like I have ANY control over my life anymore.  None whatsoever.  I can't please anyone, and pleasing myself just doesn't help anything in the long run.  

WHY DOES LIFE HAVE TO SUCK SO MUCH ALL THE TIME?!!?
