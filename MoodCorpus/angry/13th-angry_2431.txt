What gives you the right to touch me!!!!!!
Well, I did not want to plage my last post with anger since it was a happy one, but I am a little enraged.  If one more person touches me without my permission I think I am going to go Psycho.  Last night at work this guy came behind the counter on me and grabbed my ass and was hitting on me.  I was like, thank you, but I am happily married.  He just would not get the hint, finally I had to kinda push him out from the counter.  I know the guy and have known him for years, I dont know if he was drunk or what but it was totally uncalled for.  I am just thankful that people kept coming in, and I was not in the back room.  That could have been a disastrous situation.  I have been hit on a few times while working the 3rd shift, but never in such an agressive manner.  I would really hate to have to kill someone, he gets the benefit of the doubt once, and that is it, there will not be a next time.  
Even though nothing really happened I still feel almost violated today and a little uneasy to go to work 3rd shift, good thing I have until next week to get my feelings in line.  
I do not know what the in hell makes people think that they can touch you when you have clearly said not to!?!
