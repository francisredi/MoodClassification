fighting Telefonica
For some weird reason I decided to contract my internet line with Telefonica, they are (would be) supposed to be the ones who can provide a better service here in Spain, they are the biggest, so they could have better prices and so. Well, the thing is they provide you something call kangaroo.net, kind o service to filter the sites od a sexual or violent nature or whatever (there are six different categories), they provide that without asking you something as simple as: sir, do you want that? Why do they do that? very simple, the "service" is free for three months, after that if you don't call to say "I don't want that anymore" they will begin charging you for this service. No need to say that if (for some reason) you are not visiting this places that are considered forbidden (yes a boring life) you will not realize you have this service (and you will pay for it). And if you are one of this guys who never check carefully the bill, may be you will not realize either (and you will pay for it). Today has been the third day I had to call in order to cancel the damn service, so I'm very angry now and I'm beginning to hate the kangaroos.
