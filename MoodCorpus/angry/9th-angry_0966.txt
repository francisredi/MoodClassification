*sigh* Sometimes I really hate my body.It's not that I feel as if I am fat, or don't have enough of certain things. I have come to learn to accept my body, and the way I am. I don't buy into that supermodel bulimic/anorexic look. Personally I think it's gross, and I am seriously offended when people accuse me of either.But anyway. As most (or all) of you know, my body is messed up. I am very susceptible to injury. I've broken bones, sprained ankles, torn cartilage, had an inflamed wrist, a partially dislocated knee, a&nbsp;strained MCL, some minor things to my other knee and&nbsp;hip, and the most recent, the concussion (which I found out from the neurologist that it was a more serious concussion then originally thought). Plus all the minor injuries that aren't worth being told here. The past months I have not slept. I haven't slept well since about Thanksgiving time. So as you can guess this causes many problems for me. In school, yes, classes are hard to pay attention and learn anything due to the extreme lack of sleep. But its is also taking a major toll on my body. Half the time my body is too weak to do much of anything. I am trying to bein yoga. I got a mat, better tape, so on and so forth. I have yet to be able to do it. And today I could barely get up and down the stairs due to exhaustion. I hate this. I hate winter/cold weather. This is the main cause of my problems. -_- sjfowav;eqhgqncr
Ok, this rant is over.
