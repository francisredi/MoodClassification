"It's unattractive when hella guys are on a girl's jock.."

I was flattered at first, but I'm just angry now. Not angry at this particular person but simply angry. Angry at these dumb guys who don't know how to speak to someone they feel like speaking to. Or the ones who don't know how to open their eyes to others outside of their "type." WHAT KIND OF BS IS THAT?! Who put the most ordinary people on illogical pedestals. Angry at myself for surrounding myself with beautiful friends with perfect love lives. Angry at stupid romance movie writers. For instilling the importance of this nonexistent love in our heads. For making me want it so bad.
Ehh. I just like blaming my lonliness on other people.
As hard as I minimize these issues in my head, they won't go away. My life is great, I have great friends and school is my main focus right now blahblahblahblah. That should be the happygolucky me because that's how my life is; I really can't ask for more. Haha. Fuck me. as much as I talk about this, it won't get better. I'm heeeelllaaaa craving a relationship. Mann. I guess I can't talk shit about these dependent girls anymore because I'm constantly building the perfect dream-man in my mind.
But can I be blamed? After trying a million guys then finding THE right one, you wanna stick with the feeling forever.
Even if he turned out to be a jerk.

EH whatever. At least GayJay's my valentiineeee. Haha. I can always count on my bestest.
