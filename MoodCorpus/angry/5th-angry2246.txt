FUMING!!
I am mad and fuming! AHHH! I just wanna hit Kevin over the head with something, anything, I don't care. I can't believe my grandma had the nerve to pick me up with that annoying, molesting, poor excuse for a man! I don't like being around him and the things he says.... AHHH! So annoying! Everytime he started cussing, I would plug my ears. Everytime he would start speaking to me about "respecting yopur elders" and "he doesn't mean anything sexual" and "this and that," I take my right hanad and start opening and closing, basically saying he is a jabber mouth and he needs to shut up. I did make a few comments. He even told me that I need to deal with him and my grandma being together or I could hit the road! Like he has any control over me! He was telling me what to do and guess what?! He was also tell my grandma when she was going to die. He actually said she would die in 10 years. I was mad!! I said only God determines that and pfft! on your supposed education!

I don't know how to deal with this. I know I need to let God to handle this but what am I supposed to do? WHAT!? Grrr... and please, with kindness, don't tell me to ignore it. Until you know how I feel, than advise me. The guy touched me sexual, without my permission! Kevin is sick... and I don't hate him but I do hate the sin. My grandma chose him over me. CHAINS! JUST LIKE MY MOM! CHAINS!!!!!!

*deep breath* I need to go and calmm myself down. Please pray for me. AHH!
