Bitter.  Hate.  Irate.  OVER THIS SHIT. 
I HATE internship interviewing.  I used to love interviewing, it was fun for me, I got to talk about myself.  I hate it now.  HATE IT.  And I hate that this whole process has made me hate something I used to enjoy.  

I had an interview on Friday, I thought it went okay, and she said she'd be calling me for a second interview.  I finally got a call today, a voicemail that she is NOT offering me a second interview.  And, this call came when I was getting ready for another interview today.  What. The. Fuck.  They aren't even supposed to tell us shit like "You'll be called for a second interview", and if you do, you sure as shit better deliver.  I was IRATE.  Fucking raging.  And ready to cry, and throw up and cause some violence.  I literally saw red.  Its not so much not getting the second interview and the crapola surrounding it, (although I AM very angry still) its the whole process of getting an internship.  Its grueling.  Its painful, it takes an emotional and physical toll on you, and I can't believe I am voluntarily asking for this crazy shit.    

I have my last interview tomorrow.  This completely sucks, I have only 2 options now.  I am really fucking pissed and disappointed, and I can't even cry or get emotional about it because I need to hold it together until my interviews are done, or I'll completely lose it.  This is a fucking nightmare.  I'm sorry, I'm totally venting, I'm just so over this whole internship process, its torture!

I'm grabbing a drink as soon as this interview is over tomorrow.  I can't take it anymore.  I'm so bitter about all of this.  Oh, and I HATE interviewing.
