Don't rain on my parade
I found out tonight that I have been accepted to the University of Western Sydney for the Master of Professional Communication program.

Unfortunately I also found out that all of Ontario's colleges are going on strike.  I need to finish my program at Seneca before I can do my MA.  And I also need to finish my program at Seneca by a reasonable time if I want to go for the July in-take which I was accepted into!

The last OPSEU Strike, in 1989, lasted for 23 days.  Guess what?  I have exactly 23 days left of classes.

And it's not just me.  The thing that gets me angry is that this may fuck up all 150,000 students affected by the strike.

The thing that gets me angry is that the OPSEU people are selfish.  The strike is unnecessary and the students are pawns.  The thing that gets me angry is that they are striking so late in the year.  Nobody has ever done that before.  Nobody has also demanded to become the highest paid teachers in all of Ontario.

And you know what?  My instructors don't want a strike.  They don't want more pay.  They want to teach but they can't because if they do OPSEU will hit them with a $10,000 fine each and then sue them for going against the union.

Nobody wins.
