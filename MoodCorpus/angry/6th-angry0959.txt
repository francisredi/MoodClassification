I HATE INCONCIDERATE BOYS WHO DON'T LIVE UP TO PROMISES!!!! AHHH!!
Pissed and sad and frusterated and annoyed and dissapointed and furious and plain old upset are about every word i can think of for my emotions right now.&nbsp; So marty and i planned on him coming up to visit me this weekend. we've planned since before xmas break. he had a month and a half to do work on his car to get it ready, and work to get money, and even though he was planning on getting here in a day in a half, guess who just called me and said "i don;t think i'm gonna be able to make it up to see you this weekend." yup my very inconsiderate boyfriend! sooooo annoyed. he told me earlier that he was gonna use this week to get his car all set for the trip (i.e oil change, etc) as well as use this week to work at the blakes house and make some money. Did he? nope!! he spent the last 3 days working with my best friend on my best friends car!! what the fuck! as you can see i'm a little angry.... well not so much angry.... more dissapointed, and just frusterated with him.&nbsp; That and the fact that god knows when i'm gonna see him now, and we all know how awfull we do when we're away from eachother for more then a few weeks. all we do is fight and we never talk and its like we're not even together. ugh! maybe i shouldn't have worked myself up for this so much.&nbsp; AND ANOTHER THING!! i told my friend diana that i couldn't go to this little black dress party that she was having on friday bc my boyfriend was coming up. so i didn't buy a dress or even bring one from home.&nbsp; so basically i canceled my plans for a friday night party with friends because of him, and no he cancelled so i'm stuck doing nothing all weekend but memorizing lines! this blows!!! omg! i hate this!!! he can be such an air head sometimes! We're offically fighting! i call it! lol
god i gotta go to bed!!! I'm so not calling him tomorrow!!!
