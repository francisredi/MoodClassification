WTF
I recently discover that a few of the new bands I've been listening to were all signed under a goddamned Christian rock label.&nbsp;WTFIgnorance is bliss sometimes. I read the lyrics before I found this out and thought 'oh, how 'bout that. No big deal; they're just being poetic.' Now I listen to it and I feel like they're trying to push they're beliefs down my throat like a damn Jehovah's Witness, which means I can't listen to it and enjoy it like I did&nbsp;two days ago.I should enter Christian Rock on the do-not-listen-to list, right under Country.&nbsp;Maybe it's because when I think Christian Rock shit bands like fucking Creed pop into my head. Okay, sure, I bought a Creed album back when they first made it big because I thought it sounded cool at the time. And I was utterly oblivious to the fact that they had a freakin' agenda in their music. I HATE it, HATE IT, HATE IT HATE IT when bands do that. Needless to say, I don't listen to Creed anymore.&nbsp;This fucking sucks. I really liked the sound of these guys too.&nbsp;Oh well, at least I didn't pay for the music. If I did I'd bring 'em right fucking back to the store.
