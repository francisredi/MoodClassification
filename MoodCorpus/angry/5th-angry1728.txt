But I'm mostly upset 'cause I can't come up with any good lyrics for this feeling.
I'm so fucked off right now, and I'm even more fucked off that I can't make the best of the situation by writing a song about it 'cause I can't come up with any fucking lyrics. I'm fucked off 'cause I had a fight with Nate, but I'm also fucked off 'cause I wrote an entry that I'm too chicken to publish, but it's okay to publish these things in songs except I can't write any fucking lyrics. Fuck! And I'm fucked off at people who cause me to get all road rage, at everyone whos ever ignored me, that Motley Crue are sooooooo far away, that I have no money, that I'm not allowed to express my feelings without getting threatened, for ALL the fucking times I've let anyone, even the people close to me, bully me into submission, and I'm fucked off that I'm not feeling submissive now 'cause then maybe I wouldn't be so angry. Instead I'm angry and I want to unleash my anger by smashing a few people around the head, except that nobody really deserves it except maybe that red t-shirted guy from the other night, and I don't know how to find him. And I'm fucked off that I have no friends to go out with tonight, and I have no idea why that is. I should be out drinking on a Friday night and I'm angry that I'm not. I want to drink and drink and drink until my head explodes. And then I hope the person who has to clean up the remains of my exploded head gets really fucked off too, so maybe someone will know how I feel.

But I'm mostly upset 'cause I can't come up with any good lyrics for this feeling.
