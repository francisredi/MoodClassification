Idiots, grr.
One thing I hate about going back home is that I'm chauffeur for everyone else. I have to drive my sister to the YMCA in the morning on saturdays and pick up everyone else in the evening if they need it.

But I AM SO ANGRY RIGHT NOW. Because of my STUPID sister (the one born after me. She's a junior in high school). First of all, I had to pick her up at Pizza My Heart, which I hate driving to because I have forgotten where it is. Second, I had to pick her up at 10pm, and I was busy with homework and was in the middle of CSI (which I hate interrupting because they move so fast that you can't jump in anymore.). Third, she told me I would only be driving her friend home (since she's our neighbor), which comes more into play later.

WORST of all, I was calling her from the red light in front of the pizzeria so I could park in a space across the street so she and her "friend" could get into the car. HOWEVER, they saw me at the light and proceeded to jump into the freaking minivan. AND, it wasn't one friend, NO, it was EIGHT OF THEM. And I nearly drove away with the car door open and left one behind because the light had turned green. And I TOLD HER I WOULD PARK ACROSS THE STREET.

And she has the guff to blame ME for nearly running over her GODDAMN friend? SO MUCH ANGER RIGHT NOW.

This is why I SERIOUSLY HATE ASIAN GIRLS LIKE HER. You know who they are. They're the ones only created to keep catholicism alive and to buy all the goddamn cosmetic products and brown hair dye available on the market. HATE SO MUCH RIGHT NOW.

Homework now because I'm seriously behind. Damn it.
