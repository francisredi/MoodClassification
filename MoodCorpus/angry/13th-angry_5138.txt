ok, now that i am home i feel free to be an angry, angry little girl.  actually, right before i left i commiserated with phanuel in the kitchen-- free to be angry because he is angry-- we got angry together over the reversion list, the nerve of the form letter to tell us to forward a final transcript in may, "pissed off" he said, he had already phoned his mother and she had told him to go out with his friends and have fun.
then to find out that a friend had found out awhile ago that she had got in-- i thought we had an unspoken agreement to tell each other.  she felt weird but didn't she know it is embarrassing to know she had already gone for a celebratory dinner with her boyfriend before i had mused to him last night on the bus about how no one knows anything.  i like that she got in but the crazy girl got in, too, and i think that is just too much information for one day.  the crazy girl that whines to me every time i see her about how she doesn't have the constitution for this, that she wants to quit grad school, that she can't handle it, that she doesn't know what to do.  i want to punch her.  i know exactly what i want to do and where and how i want to do it.  fuck the bastards.
