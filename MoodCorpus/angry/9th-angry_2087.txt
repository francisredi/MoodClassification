Sigh,
I would like to know how the people who have interesting education during high school, like going to night school for two hours twice a week, or whatever, I would like to know how they did it. 
Because, quite frankly, I'm REALLY FED UP with high school. 

It's not the teachers, or the classes, or the material, it's the people. The stupid people who populate the hallways, and the classrooms, and the stupid people who I can't seem to get away from. The hypocritical people I see everyday. I find it hilarious (no, not really) how someone can be so different one moment and then soo different the next. I don't understand why people care so damn much about what other people think? LIKE SERIOUSLY? Are you so desperate to fit in or be "unique" that you change your entire appearance, and alter your music tastes and everything about you? What ever happened to individuality? Why overdo your makeup, wear way-too-tight pants, and tease your hair to make it stand up to impress a bunch of people who lack a personality?

I hate people who say they hate a certain type of people, and then you see them befriending the people they just said they can't stand.
I hate when people talk about people one moment, and then are like "omgzz i love you" the next.
I hate people who only like something because someone you want to be like likes it.
I hate people who think they know a lot, but they really know little.
I hate when people think listening to hardcore is listening to Norma Jean and Every Time I Die, and I hate people who think listening to indie is listening to Tegan and Sara (though I love them), Death Cab For Cutie, and Bright Eyes. SHUT UP. Oh my god, shut up.

Whatever, these are my ramblings. These are some genuine thoughts of mine and if you feel like you have to come and bitch about it to me, then don't waste your breath. I really don't care what you think.
