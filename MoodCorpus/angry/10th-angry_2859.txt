The Whales Are My Homies
Being a teenager sucks. Especially when you're me. I hate my life, I love myself, I have nothing but good expectations for myself, but my life sucks. Ok, that's a lie, I fully expect myself to end up flipping burgers or filing things and I hate my guts. There it fucking is. Happy? Oh yeah, and plus the fact that I've never had any guy take any intrest in me that wasn't drunk and over twentey, I secretely suspect my freinds of avoiding me and and and I have a crush where I know it isn't going to turn into anything, but I can't get over it. And I don't know why because he isn't super cute or anything, I have just become obbsessed. And obbsessions turn into me making bad plans and obbsessing over how worthless I am. It feels really good just to pound away at an acoustic guitar, even though I can't play at all. I know to hold down the frets, and I can alternate fingers from those bass lessons I took. But still, just strumming really hard makes me feel good. Maybe I'll go learn. I'm not a big Nirvana fan or anything, but wasn't it Kurt who said that to learn the guitar all you need is Louie Louie. So I guess I'll start with that. Ah Kurt. My partner in virgo rising. You know the parts of his songs where he feels awkward for himself? Those are the virgo rising songs, I should know. It seems to be the dominant aspect in my chart besides my sun, aaah. I fucking hate being this awkward. I hate being a teen.
