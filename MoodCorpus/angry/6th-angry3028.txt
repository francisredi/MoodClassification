I fucking hate my family.
I hate that just because they were taught to go to church every Sunday, and be good catholic people, that that is what I have to do. I hate that I don't even have a choice to look outside the boundries at what else is out there, I have to do what they do and beleive what they believe. It is so fucking unfair I can't even tell you. If I told my parents that I more truely believe an Agnostics point-of-view on the whole "God" thing, they would flip out. They would most likely dis-own me, beleive it or not. They think that I am arguing with them about going to church because I am lazy and do not want to get up in the morning for it. They are right that I do not want to get up for it, but it is not because I am lazy, it is because I beleive it's a waste of time for me to be sitting there listening to people talk and sing about something that I do not beleive. My aunt baught me a book called "God is an artist, and I am his masterpeice" for my birthday, for one,  fuck that. Two, I had to lie about reading it and feel more horrible so I didn't cause conflict. I hate that they are not open to any new ideas, it's either you are in and beleive what they do, like it or not, or you are out, and have an open mind to new ideas, but be by yourself without a family. Right now I am actually starting to think that out is looking pretty good. The fact that they won't even listen to my ideas are so immature and irrational, yet I am the immature one that cannot think for herself and is just plain lazy. 
Fuck them.
