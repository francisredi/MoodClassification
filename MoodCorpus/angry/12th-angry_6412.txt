*yawn*
This week seems to have gone by slow slowly and its only Wednesday! I have been trying to find this song online for weeks now and have had no luck and I'm getting really frustrated. Its hard to get lyrics to a song that isn't in English since I can only pick out words because singing is so much harder to understand than regular talking. I thought i had a good start but I accidently wrote on tape on my piece of paper so the words smeared off. *sigh* 
I hate being such a light sleeper. I hate trying to fall asleep for two hours. I hate waking up at the slightest sound - like Estelle's alarm clock. I wake up and think "what horrible thing have I done to be woken up at this hour?" *sigh* I hate that it takes another half hour to fall back asleep.
Have everything squared away for my last weekend here. Its weird to think that this weekend is my last weekend in Oradour. Crazy. Not much has been happening. Did get to go on a tour of the archives here at the centre which was pretty cool. Got some information about the archives and stuff so I can show my archives teacher that I've been productive. Had a two hour lunch yesterday because people filtered through the breakroom so that helped cut the workday down and make it feel much shorter. *sigh* I guess that's it. I should actually get to work.
