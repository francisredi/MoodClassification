April Fools' Day Fucking Sucks...
Hey,  or whoever made the original "Valentine's Day Fucking Sucks" image, could you retool it for April Fools' Day and then give it to me? :)

I hate April Fools' Day.  Let's just establish that before I start this entry.  I hate it for a lot of reasons, most of those reasons probably in the vein "The jokes are cruel and lame." and "It's not funny."

When was April Fools' Day considered relevant, hip or even at one point, funny?  That is something I wish to know. It's probably one of those mysteries of the universe that once you uncover, you fall into a great paradox and therefore can never return to tell everyone the answer.

This year, the Volante gave me some additional hate on the holiday. Verve has already been embarassingly sloppy this semester when it comes to copyediting, but it was only made worse this week by the fact NO ONE (in a chain of command spanning six people) realized they had "April Fools' Day" written as "April Fool's Day" SEVERAL TIMES in not only a story discussing it, but TWO SEPARATE HEADLINES.

The term is plural. That means anything with "s" at the end has its apostrophe after the "s", not before it. This is something we miss all the time in all the sections, and it's a really dumb mistake.

There was also in Verve two typos right besides each other at one point in the section, as well as the word "pirates" being misspelled in the jump headline for my story this week.

Without calling out names, we will just call this week's effort "embarassing" and just move on.

I'm going to get some sleep and then maybe read some homework tomorrow.  Which would then allow to acquire even more sleep. :)
