EVILNESS!
Some highlights of the past few days:

*When they say they will be cutting hours... they weren't kidding.
*I fucking hate math.
*Troy University is picky.
*Alabama Power is stupid. Let's work on the power lines at 6 am!!
*College is expensive.
*Customers are rabid, evil beings that have no souls. I think they are zombies.
*Being sick sucks.
*I still fucking hate math.

So, I'm supposed to be at work right now. Why am I online? They sent me home early because they scheduled too many people to work! I closed last night (left at 12:15) and came back this morning (7:55 am), complaining about being sick (some damn bug is going around) and the comanager basically tells me to suck it up. So after making me come in anyways, they tell me to go home at 9:15. I worked for one fucking hour. After being told that I would be needed too much today to call out so I can go to the doctor.
Yah, fuck you too.

I hate math.

I am gonna run for now, gonna try to get this MOUND of homework done before saturday...
