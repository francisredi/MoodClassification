PRETENTIOUS TWADDLE
I don't know what to eat. I still have no peanut butter which is causing me a large amount of pain behind my eyes.

I was so angry today (for no valid reason, I might add) that I had a big frustrated headache and did all my french work wrong. Then I aborted mission and came on here. My headache has evapourated, even if my annoyance hasn't. 

I hate it when Sasha starts barking to say she needs a crap when my mum has someone coming over and I have to bump into them on the way out of the door. I like to stay in my room and not meet people- it avoids awkwardness.

I can't stand people sometimes. I remember when Laura, Karen et moi were in Rav's and this fucking stupid woman started trying to make conversation with us: "Are you in the sixth form?" "What subjects do you do?" "Is it near exam time?" "Are you working hard?" SHUT THE FUCK UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I left it all to Laura. I've given up making an effort with these people that feign interest.

I wish spring would grab this awful country in its feeble little growing hands. I HATE MISERABLE WEATHER! HATE IT HATE IT HATE IT!
