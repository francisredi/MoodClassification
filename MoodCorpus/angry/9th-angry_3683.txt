ANGER!!!!!!!!!!!!
Things about a certain friend that have made all of the respective friends angry:
-complaining about lack of money, when you have never tried to have a real job but receive a 200-300$ per month allowance from mummy and daddy and you have a 1000$ credit card limit per month WHICH YOU ALWAYS REACH. Complaining when other people spend their hard-earned money. Yet, you, the responsibility carrying person, pay your OWN bills every month, with money mummy and daddy put in your account. That way, you can easily hide and frivolous purchases from your parents. When you get in trouble, you don't get punished, you get a free lawyer, but complain that your parents are using your spring break money (that they had allotted) to pay for it. WHO GETS SPRING BREAK MONEY ALLOWANCE ANYWAYS?!? AND if you can afford to buy 18365183518377395792 pairs of shoes, why can't you pay 6$ to go to panera? And you drive a 30000$ car which your sister also has. Don't bitch to us about not being rich, sorry, we don't buy it.
-You bitch when your friends go out without you because you "can't afford it" but then spend 40$ on alcohol.
-Drink friends alcohol without asking OR offering to pay, but charge 5+ dollars for approximately 2 shots whenever you have a stash of your own, which you bought while everyone else was out having fun.
-You go out to get shitfaced, so that anything stupid you do can have an automatic justification. This includes, but is not limited to: random hook-ups (including threesomes and other random sexual escapades that would probably give nuns a heart attack), losing a friend's nice shirt at an apartment while "not hooking up" and refusing to go back and get it, stealing alcohol from people who consider you friends.
-Clinging to guys who obviously hate you, just because they are unattainable, then using guys that actually LIKE you and don't just wanna fuck to play mindgames with the mean guys.
-Complaining about being hungry but not eating then going to the gym 43857 times a day, just to see said mean guy above. Also, criticizing the way other people eat because you "know" what's right for everyone else.
-complianing about your reputation but then going and doing the same things that got you the rep in the first place. good plan, hope that works out for you. Even better, trying to transfer to a place you told everyone was lame, just to start over your rep, but wait, you've had random sex with guys there too?
sorry, this is a collective angry entry
