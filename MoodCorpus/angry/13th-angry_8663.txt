It really bothers me that you think you know everything all of a sudden, and it bothers me more that you flaunt shamelessly, the feelings that don't even exist in your current "position".  You don't know anything about that ok? You don't know the first thing about it.  I hate the way you shun me because you think you're better than me or something, and in the end, this is all your fault.

Why couldn't you just hate me upfront than? You don't have to be two faced, you can tell me you hate me, chances are I won't go ape on you, I'll just leave you alone.  Stop pretending your so good, your not, you want to know devotion? You want to know skill?  Go to the band room, Crystal is there almost every waking moment of the day (and mayeb even at night O_o) practicing.  Until you show that you prove that you have that same devotion, don't brag about it.  You're so full of shit, sometimes it just makes me want to puke.

(In reference to what Jonalee and I were talking about earlier..) You're right Jonalee, you're so right, it gets to a point where, you can stop crying, and moping around, and you can only be mad.  And that's exactly what happened to me. I have so had it with you, with trying to impress you, and you just treat me like I don't belong, like I'm not good enough.

fuck with me now..I dare you
