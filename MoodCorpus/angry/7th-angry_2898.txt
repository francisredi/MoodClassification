*venting time*
You know what? I really hate living here. Yeah. I really do. I hate the junky old redneck houses where people put their old toilets on their front porch and I hate the stupid stuffed cow head that moos drunkenly at you in the dairy section at the grocery store. I should I have a positive attitude about this, I know, but it really sucks when you are excited that Sonic has the only fruit smoothie you've seen anywhere since you've moved and it ends up tasting like sugar granules blended with nasty pieces of vaguely tropical fruit and drenched with enough coconut syrup for 10 smoothies. I hate that the roads are made of gravel and when there are thunderstorms you can't go out and visit people that are further away and I don't have any friends here, blast it all.

It's funny. When I lived in Cali I fancied myself a somewhat country girl at heart. HA! Hahahaha. That's a laugh. I am nothing like these people. They don't understand why someone would want to go to a coffeeshop and just chill there and hang out with friends. I would think that was a universal concept, but here? No. They want to dress up in their camo, and got out HUNTIN'. *gags* What. the heck. I'm sorry to anyone that does understand that lifestyle, but I don't. I hate hate hate it here. And there's no diversity. When Hurricane Katrina hit there was supposed to be a shelter/soup kitchen type thing in one of the towns near me and I wanted to volunteer but NO. The people that lived there SHOT at the camp that was being set up because they didn't want no black people in their town. HURRICANE VICTIMS. That just baffles me and disgusts me.

Anyway there's nothing to do here, and it's difficult to get out of town to get to "civilization." I better not have to live here more than 5 more months or so (til the end of this semester), I am starting to go insane...
