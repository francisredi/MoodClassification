He does it again, the FUCKER!
Email I just sent to NCWM and J:

Is [BWIAL] freaking KIDDING ME?!?!?!?!
 
He has this seminar that he's doing in March, and his deadline for submission of materials was February 6th, so of course he's madly working on them... today.  After having [New Puppy M] draft them.
 
There are apparently all these rules about how we are to submit them (font, spacing, headers, etc).  And he gives me revisions to one of two things AT FOUR O'CLOCK ON A FUCKING FRIDAY?!?!?!!?!?!?!
 
I *hate* when he does this.  I was hoping to get out of here EARLY today, not have to sit here until his *@#&)#@ procrastinating ass decides to work on seminar document # 2, not to mention change them both around a dozen times.
 
I AM SO FREAKING ANGRY RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I hate that he did this today.  I hate that he does this at all.  But when he does it on a FRIDAY, DAMMIT, it makes it make me want to kill him.

Plus, the document that New Puppy M did has all this weird formatting in it that I can't seem to fix, because I don't know what the HELL he did.  This is such a fucking nightmare.

I HATE MY BOSS'S PROCRASTINATION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
