Fucking Parents!
God my parents frustrate me SOOOOOO much!

Once again I'm sitting here with Nan trying to work out how to get myself out of my finacial worries. First step is to move into a cheaper place to rent right? So even though I'll be working in Doncaster it's too dear to move out that way. It's only 20-25 minutes drive from around this area. Well I saw a few places around Reservoir area (suburb next to Preston, where I live now). They were bungalows for between $100-120; so quiet cheap.

Anyways I ring my Dad, who is a tax accountant, to see if he can tell me exactly what my take home pay will be every fortnight. Like I got my pay details but Dad can tell me how much tax I get taken out and therefore what my real pay will be. So then I can work out how much I can afford to pay on rent per pay.

So... Dad tells me the figure and I'm alright with that, and I tell him that I'm looking at places to rent around here for $100-120 (I'm currently paying $160 p/w)... and he starts going off at me! Tells me that Reservoir is too far from Donnie (Doncaster)! I tell him 20 minutes isn't that far and he uses the line "Well how are you going to get there if you lose your car?!"

FOR FUCK'S SAKE! LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE!  :s

You always have to stick your two cents worth in and take me down a notch because you never think I'll get anywhere in life with anything do you! You always think I'll forever be in debt and be running to you to borrow money. You never think to just lend a helping hand and say "yes I am your father and I am going to help you". You always have to bring me down and I HATE YOU FOR IT!

I HATE YOU! I FUCKING HATE YOU!

Why can't you just be happy for me for once?

Reservoir is cheap rent. Doncaster is like million air's row or something. If I live in a cheap bungalow then I can use the extra money I'd be saving, to PAY FOR MY CAR! To pay for all these debts I have for CRYING OUT LOUD!

Fucking parents! Who needs them?
