I can't sleep...I got a couple of bug bites and I found at least 1 bug in my bed.  I don't know why it's there. I don't think it was there before I left, and I've been gone for a week so it's had nothing to eat. I'll have to spend tomorrow washing all my blankets, sheets and clothes in hot water, possibly finding a plastic sheet or enclosure for my mattress (I won't by a new one as long as I'm living here, there's no point) to keep any bugs in it away from me, and buying an anti-bedbug spray to apply to my room, bedframe, etc.  I thought I just washed my sheets before I left :(

Now that the landlord has sealed up the baseboards, my roommates don't have an excuse to be lazy and ignore the problem.  I'm angry that they've let it go long enough that it's become my problem now too. They must have come in from the living room...E says he got bitten from being on the couch, and I know B has been sleeping out there instead of in her room; she must still have bugs and she brought them out to the couch in her blankets. grrr.

That really does it. I'll do what I can to fight the problem in my own sphere, I'll even try one more time to get B to take care of them in her room, but really I need to move out as soon as I can manage. I officially hate New York City apartments...always some kind of vermin to torment me.
