ugh
"sushi, my love, let's never have teenagers" i say to my cat as i rush off to find something to wear and brush my teeth at the same time.  Let me explain this a little.  I was awoken at about 6:30am - STILL NIGHTTIME PEOPLE - by my cell phone (i keep it on at all times in case of emergency or babe calling) and as i fall out of bed - painfully - and rush to the phone i'm freaking that somthing majorly evil must have happened because even my parents have learned not to call before at the very earlier eight am.  When i answer Jackie is on the other end "Naomi?" "[enter here uninteligable greeting]" "i know it's a little early (sob) but [enter here something uninteligable (or i stopped paying attention, whatever)]...so can you pick me up and take me to school?" "[enter here something that probably sounded like a dog uder a car tire]" "what?" "sure, let me get dressed and wash my face"  fifteen minutes later the phone is ringing off the preverbial hook as i rush back into the room with my hairbrush stuck in my head and one overall strap hanging off my shoulder to answer it, it's Jackie again.  "oh, never mind, my mom [enter here jumbled words my anger blocked me from understanding] but that you anyway." "Sure, jackie, whatever, bye now"

I.
HATE.
TEENAGERS.

So i tried going back to sleep, except now i have a killer headache that isn't going away and i leave in about twenty minutes to work and i'm hoping to god this doesn't turn into a migrane because even if i come home early the drive is (at my very best when i'm going 90mph and never slowing down) 30-45min long.  I feel like somthing that was just eeked out of some fowl animal's disgusting bowels.  How has ya'll's day been going so far?...at freaking 7:30 in the freaking morning.
