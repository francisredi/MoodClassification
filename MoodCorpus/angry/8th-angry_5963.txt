Do you know that feeling when you just know you're carrying an obsession too far? I'm feeling that right now. And, for some reason, I'm fine that way. I think this might actually do me some good at some point, so I'm not going to think much into this whole thing this time.

On other news, I hate it when people tell you to do something, you bust your ass off doing it and then they just go "Uh-- no. That's not it." This mini-rant actually originated from a very dumb little argument, but shit, did it piss me off! I've been so moody lately, it's not even funny. 

We had lunch at my grandmother's house today and I attempted some conversation with my fuck-up cousins, but it just didn't work out. Every word they uttered was pain to my ears, I could hardly stand it. It might be my moody-self speaking right now... but I hate them so much. I hate most of my family excluding mom & dad (which also indeed have their moments of DUH -- I just happen to have respect/love/appreciation for them, otherwise I guess I'd hate them too... no doubt about it).

I'm so fucking bored and hoping school will start again soon enough, even though I KNOW I'll be angry at myself in a week for wanting to go back to school. But, hey, someone's got to make a career and be famous-- and that happens to be me. So yeah, I've got no choice.

Shit this entry got longer than I expected it to! I guess my rambling gets out of hand once I start ranting and reviewing my day... this makes me LOL in a bad way.
