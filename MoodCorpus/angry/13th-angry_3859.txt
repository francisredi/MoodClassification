I'm starting to not like teaching.  And it's just a few kids who are causing me to hate it.  I hate that I don't get to do what I love and what I'm trained to do and just have to discipline all the time.  These kids just love to push, push, push to see what they can get away with. And they love to do it with me because I'm a student teacher and they think they can get away with anything. I hate disciplining the kids.  But I'm getting yelled at from Kathleen for not being harsh enough.  Geez, I don't want to be the nazi teacher that carries a whip around, then the kids would never want to come to class and never want to learn.  There has to be a happy medium somewhere.  I just hate it that I have to spend more time worrying about discipline problems than what I'm actually going to teach them.  It really makes me think twice about doing this in the future.  Right now I'm burnt out and I hate it and I've only been doing it for 10 weeks.  Who knows what I'm going to do in life.  I'll just be one of those people who sits around doing nothing, wasting away.  I know what I WANT to do it life, but who knows if I even have the talent to do that.  This part of life sucks right now.  I want to know what I'm doing and feel successful and loved and happy.  Life is about hills and valleys, but I've been in this damn valley for WAY too long now, I'm kinda sick of it.
