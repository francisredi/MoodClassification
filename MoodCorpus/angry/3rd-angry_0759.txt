Bad Mary
And then it goes down again.  My good mood lasted surprisingly long, considering a rather wretched comment from my mother on the phone the other night.  But I'm pretty sure it's slipped away.  Hell, I think it ran away from me because all of a sudden in the shower, here came the damn tears again...and lots of anger.  So much anger.  It's really good that I don't drink anymore, or I would be halfway in the bottle by now, heading straight for the bottom.  I was so mad at so many people...still am...and I thought about how I would love to have them all in one place and give them something along the lines of an acceptance speech to them, except instead of thanking them for giving me something nice (like an award), I would thank them individually for the things they did to fuck me up in the head.  But one of them is already dead, so there's no chance of ever telling him just how much he hurt me.  Eventually, they'll all die off, and I think I would have a really great feeling knowing that they're not cursing this planet anymore.  Did I mention that I'm basically just really pissed off?  

I know the other day I felt like everything was going to be all right.  Now I can't remember why.
