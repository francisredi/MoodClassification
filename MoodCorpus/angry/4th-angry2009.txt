You won't believe me. I would if you told me so.
I love some people in drama. And they know it. Said people are really awesome. But I am SO sick of drama right now. I hate being in tech and making fucking charts instead of actually building the damn set! That's why I liked being in drama. Because I like building things. We have the mother fucking construction teacher with us, yet we're not building anything. I understand that he wants to make sure that we don't waste expensive plexyglass, but come on. Tell someone to make the fucking charts before rehearsal so we're not sitting on our asses the entire time. You know what? I should just quit. I hate the show, I hate a ton of the people doing the show, I hate not building anything, and I hate being at school for 11 hours a day. But I also love one-act competition. I like being around other schools' drama programs, even if they are mean to us. And even if I absolutely loathe 7/8 of the people in the program, the other 1/8 are fucking awesome. But still, I hate having to hitch rides with people every day. I feel like a hobo.
