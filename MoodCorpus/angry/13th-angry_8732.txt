I really want to make a huge long post, but I'm running into problems with it. I'd want to split it into several friendslocked posts, each filtered according to what I'm currently willing to admit to my various circles of friends and acquaintances. A lot of the people I want to read the post don't even have livejournals, so it's a flawed idea to start with.

I haven't spoken to so many people in so long, I'm living out in the sticks, I don't have reliable internet access, I'm trying to deal with various crap, I'm stressed and it's making me do dumb things, most of my friends seem to be trying to cope with as much or more bullshit in their lives as I am, like usual I'm feeling guilty for things that aren't even remotely my fault, I almost died of shock yesterday when something went RIGHT, I'm running out of patience and energy and resources to deal with all of this again, but at least this time I'm angry. Anger gets me a long way. I like being angry.

Knowing what I'm doing with myself isn't making anything easier. My doctor gave me a script for Lexapro. There's no way I'm taking the shit. I wouldn't be whining so hard, I know exactly what would cheer me up, but I can't do it, so I'm wangsting on LJ and daydreaming about hunting something down and having hot sweet blood all over my hands. Can't even organise a fucking birthday party for myself, everything is that up in the air. ANGST. WHINE. ARG.
