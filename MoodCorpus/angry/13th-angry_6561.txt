Dear world,
Go fuck yourself.
Love,

Okay seriously. People get mad at me for being overweight. People get mad at me for trying to lose weight. What the shit is wrong with everyone?! I admit maybe ephdrine pills would be a little extreme and possibly dangerous, but I canned that idea because I couldn't find any and my friends are still getting mad at me!! This is bullshit. I don't need to stand around and listen to my mom tell me I should go excorsise and my brother tell me I look worse then the mayor from the nightmare before christmas and then turn around and have my friends yell at me for wanting to be skinny.  It's not fair. All I was looking for was a fucking appitite suppressant. I just wanted to cut back on calories and excorsise a few hours a day. How is that stupid? How is that an unhealthy obsession. Wouldn't you think like me too if your siblings tourtered you about being fat? And your parents constantly reminded you that you were the heaviest baby and told you you'd never be able to do anything if you weren't in shape? I didn't mean to gain weight like this. I didn't mean to dissappoint anyone. God I feel so ugly right now. I feel like throwing up. I'm going downstairs to burn some serious calories instead of sitting up here like a blob. I hate this place.
