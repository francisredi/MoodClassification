I HATE PEOPLE!
so have you ever had one of those things, that even though you said something you believe in, you with you could take it back because everyone blew it out of proportion and now everyone hates you....

so, on the forum that my friend runs for my high school friends, someone posted a picture of a naked girl wearing a feather boa and tickling her ass.  I simply said something along the lines of "could you please not do that again" and it turned into this whole big thing about how that's not porn and I should look beyond what I think is my world and shit like that.  I didn't even say that it WAS porn.  I just asked that it not be done.  I, frankly, don't give a fuck whether it's degrading toward women or even considered porn or not.  I don't want to see a picture of a naked woman on a place where I "hang out" with my friends.  All I did was ask that it not be done again.  I didn't make a big deal out of it.  

GOD, PEOPLE PISS ME OFF SOMETIMES!  I HATE it that my friends make me explain WHY I don't want to see pictures of naked women.  I FUCKING HATE IT!
