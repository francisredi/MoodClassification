Nothing...
I've come to learn something in the past few days.  NOTHING is set definite in our lives, but death.  You might be thinking, "I know she'll come back" or "I know nothing is as bad as it seems" but IT GETS WORSE.  ALWAYS!!!!!  It only gets worse.  All that is going to happen, is that people will turn, you will remain the same, people will turn and you will be all alone - searching for the reasons why your life is as shitty as it is.  I found the reason.  I found the reasons my life always screws up.  It's because of me.  I'm stupid in the things I do and say.  I hate the way I am - the way I talk, act, react, and whatever else I fuck up.  I hate it.  I used to think that if "someone doesn't like me, they can go fuck themselves - I don't care..."  But honestly, I don't like me.  I screw too many things up and I don't know how to do anything right.  FUCK!!!!!  I hate it.  Well, time to go cool off.  Just remember - your death is the only thing that can save you from your pain.  Remember that...I will...
