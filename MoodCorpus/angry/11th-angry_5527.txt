Evil People
So, today I realized Annelise had left her phone in my car. Her mom called and I picked it up and explained why I had Annelise's phone. Her mom asked me to take it to her at work and get her food from wendy's. I said ok. 
I went to Burger King instead and then to her work. But when I got there I discovered she wasn't going to work until 6. I remembered Amanda Holman's away message about the leadership workshop meeting so I went up to school (because I didn't want my 20 minute trip to be worth nothing- I couldn't even eat the chicken nuggets) 

When I got to her school I banged on the door where all the leadership staff was and Annelise came over and opened the door and said "don't look at me don't look at me" so I sort of turned around and explained why I was there. Then some other pissy girl came over and Annelise told her that her mom told me to come. The pissy girl made Annelise go back and told me I wasn't supposed to know what was happing and I just ruined that. Ouch. So I forgot Loos's phone was in my pocket and went back to my car to get it, discovered it in my pocket, and went back to the door. But I decided to please the pissy girl I would close my eyes and walk with the phone out in my hands.  I heard her say "Ok now you're just irratating," take the phone, and close the door. 

I was SO angry. My initial reaction was that I wish I had slapped her, then I thought about not going on leadership workshop because personally I don't want to learn to be as rude as she is. Honestly, I went out of my way to deliver a freaking phone and food and I get yelled at. Just goes to show that no good deed goes unpunished. Hah. 
Annelise, you weren't that grateful either... but I'm more angry at the pissy girl. I don't know who she is, but I want her to know she was rude to me, and it makes me not want to spend a weekend with people like that. 

/end rant.
