jump on the table, kick away the beer
Huh, what can I say about work? Well, it was crowded as hell. Crowded. As. Hell. Everyone and their grandmother's neighbor's sister and her 7 kids were there. And there were lost kids galore. This one lady gave me a description of her lost kid. He had red hair, a jersey and a matching baseball cap. Now you'd think that's pretty conspicuous, but damned if I could find him in that sea of people. Dora told me that on free wednesdays it's even crazier. o_0

I'm getting paid, I'm getting paid. I must remember I'm getting paid.

Oh yeah, and guess what else I did today? I finished all my winter break homework! Wh0000t!!! I did it! I really did it! *table dances like a maniac* 90 pages of reading and a journal on it, but I did it in one day. Take THAT and suck it like a joint Ms. E.

I am so happy, but on the other hand I'm also kind of annoyed. That's just 'cause my mom got mad at me for being stupid. I hate that. I mean, it's one thing if she thinks I'm an idiot ('cause I kinda am) but getting mad at me for it? Damn! I'm sorry I'm not smart enough to psychicly pick up on things, goddamn! I'm sorry that people have to go through aaaalll the trouble to tell something to my face if they want me to know it because I'm not fucking able to just know things. Grrrraah... Sometimes people's expectations are just too fucking high.

What a schitzo post this was.
