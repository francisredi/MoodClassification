Crappy Day 
Gah.  So, it's been a while since I've felt the need to type on this stupid thing, but alas, here I am again, because I am mad, angry, lonely, confused, and conflicted.  I'm not really going to get into it, but this just hasn't been too hot of a day.  Carolyn and I are in a fight, or that is, we would be if we were actually having civilized conversations with each other.  Also, my instructors course just got cancelled at the YMCA, YES, the one that I NEED so that I can start applying for jobs and make some more money, and I can't take any of the other courses offered throughout the city because they're all on Saturday's, and I already work teaching piano and vocal on Saturdays.  Then, to make matters even better, I found out that the pool that I work at during the summer doesn't even HAVE any openings for me to instruct this summer, because all the stupid instructors from last year are coming back, and the one that left is being replaced by a guard that's stupider than I am, but just got her qualification a little while before me.  I'm so pissed right now!!!!! Because this now means that i'll STILL have to do baskets and I can't work in the mornings AT ALL!!!  Gah...i'm so mad.  And I know that right now I sound like a complete little immature child, but I'm so mad that words can't even describe it.  Plus I have a splitting headache today.  Oh well.  

Hopefully this day will get better...maybe I'll go out and buy some Ben and Jerry's ice cream or something.
