Stupid PS2 video game filth nonsense...
OK, so, I was playing Mark's PS2 last night, and I don't remember anything about Castlevania: Lament of Innocence.  I mean, I was right at the very end when I had to go back to school and then Mark moved, and I never got to play it again until now, 2-3 years later.  I couldn't even remember how to block my opponent and I was obliterated.  Grr.  And I've got some practice in but still...I just want to beat the game.  I'm at the end, just let me win!  Rawr!

So then I got frustrated and tried God of War, which is pretty cool, but I have no "balance"...or rather I have a difficult time balancing my character.  Gah!

Video games make me violently angry.  And I guess arguably it's because I'm playing violent games.  But I think it's really because I can't beat the games and then get frustrated and violent.

Damn it!

...and yet I realize I'm listening to Joni Mitchell's "Big Yellow Taxi", which is the most non-violent song EVAH.  *sigh*  I'm so complex...
