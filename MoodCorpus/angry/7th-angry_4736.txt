I'm sure I've ranted about this before in my former journal, but I HATE FIREWORKS. I hate them so, especially when they're set off at midnight to ring in whatever festive celebration it is now. Hello, what about the people who want to take a break from a hectic day, or the people who are already asleep? Thanks a lot for ruining what could've been a peaceful night, you little turds. And if that's not bad enough, sometimes they make the dogs in our neighbourhood start barking and howling! Yay, MORE NOISE! God. I'm not trying to be a wet blanket or anything, but please, this isn't the first time you're experiencing the beginning of a new year - spare a thought for the people who are taking the opportunity to rest during the holidays. And you know what? Fireworks are illegal in our country. Yes, illegal! And what are the police doing about it? Clearly nothing, because as I type, my neighbours are setting off fireworks! ARGH. I seriously hate fireworks. And then the next day the papers will be filled with articles and gruesome pictures of people with severely burnt limbs because of fireworks gone awry. Guh. They never learn, do they?

Proper past tense should be added to the growing list of animals facing extinction. I was at Jusco Tebrau City today, and my god, the amount of shops bearing the sign "WE ARE CLOSE" and its variant "WE WILL BE CLOSE" on the front door is just ... overwhelming. And thing is, they're all like, shops with branded goods - the "popular" shops. I honestly don't know what to say; I think I'm better off sticking toothpicks into my eyes.
