AS I SIT HERE, MY EYES RED AND SWOLLEN FROM TOO MUCH HURT BEHIND THE TEARS THAT I CAN'T LET FALL...I WONDER HOW I COULD HAVE BEEN SO WRONG IN CHOOSING TO STAY WITH SILK.  HE BASICALLY JUST TOLD ME THAT HE DOESN'T SUPPORT ME EMOTIONALLY OR MENTALLY BECAUSE I HAVEN'T MOVED FORWARD IN MY LIFE. BUT WHAT KIND OF MAN HAS SUCH A CONDITIONAL LOVE AS THAT? HOW CAN I LIVE WITH A MAN WHO IS REJECTING ME IN THE SAME EXACT WAYS AS MY MOTHER DID MANY TIMES OVER...HOW CAN I SURVIVE IN A RELATIONSHIP WHERE MY NEXT MOVE AND HIS NEXT REACTION OR LACK THERE OF CAN MAKE NO DIFFERENCE OR ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD TO KEEPING ME ALIVE AND WELL AND NOT PUSHING ME OVER THE EDGE? IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENCE ANYMORE. ALL THIS PAIN AND HURT THAT I FEEL WELLING UP INSIDE ME LIKE A WAVE ABOUT TO CRASH, IS ENOUGH TO REALLY MAKE ME THINK TWICE ABOUT LIVING AT ALL.  I MEAN WHY SHOULD I PUT MYSELF THROUGH THIS? WHY SHOULD I BOTHER WITH LIVING AT ALL WHEN THERE HAS GOT TO BE SOMETHING BEYOND THIS LIFE. SOMETHING THAT WON'T HURT ME AS MUCH. SOMETHING THAT CAN'T POSSIBLY HURT ME THIS MUCH.......i HATE IT, I HATE THIS STUPID LIFE AND THIS STUPID CITY AND THIS STUPID RELATIONSHIP...I HATE IT ALL SO  MUCH RIGHT NOW
