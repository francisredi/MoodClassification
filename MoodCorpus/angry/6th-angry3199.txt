I hate him, I hate him, I hate him!

He has to ruin every good moment in my fucking life! I just want to scream and cry right now because he will never ever ever want to leave me alone. I just know that he won't. Even if I move on the other side of the country, get hitched and pop out some babies then he'd still be bugging the hell out of me. 

I wonder if he has this link too?

No doubt about it. He had some guy hack into my MSN stuff, so I can guarantee that he has been here before. He was on my Xanga. He bitched at me for some of the things I wrote. That's the point in a journal. Bitch all you want.

I talked to him Friday night because he had the balls to call me, after getting the CallWave several times. He called me immature just because I wouldn't get off. But I finally did just because I was bored with the people I was chatting with and I wanted to watch some movies I'd rented from Movie Gallery. 

He said it'd be the last time he'd ever call me. But I have doubts about that. He's said that 486968473829596 times before and has he yet? Noooooo.
