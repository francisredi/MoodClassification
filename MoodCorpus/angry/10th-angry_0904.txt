I don't think I will ever be able to understand how my mind really works.  

I've become seriously afraid of death lately, and it's not fear for myself.  Sam is planning on going into the military, which is all fine because he has been for awhile.  Never bugged me really, I thought it was great.  Then he said something today that just kind of, made me stop breathing momentarily.  He was talking about how he wanted to join the infintry right away because he thought it'd be easier to die with just friends than to die with a family and kids.  Which is completely understandable in a very logical way, which I can totally see.  But then the thought of him dying really kind of sunk in.  I've been on the verge of tears since he said that (at about 5:30 this evening).  I mean, I've seen people die right in front of me, I've seen death and I don't fear it.  But just thinking of him dying, just thinking of him getting hurt, completely broke me down.  Losing friends and family has sucked enough, I don't even want to begin thinking about losing him like that.  Unfortunately this has also reverted me back into my original self by wanting to close in and push everything away because I can't bear the thought of losing anything, particularly him.  I have to get over this eventually because that's just how life works and I KNOW that, I've always known that, but I can't seem to make it stop bothering me so much.  

This of course has been a great addition to how I've been thinking about existence in general and driving myself crazy with questions where there is no possible way to actually formulate an answer to.

I feel so helpless and I hate it.  I hate the feeling of vulnerability and I hate the fact that I continue to put myself into situations where I do become vulnerable.  

Fuck I hate February.
