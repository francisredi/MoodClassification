I hate my heart!!!!
This is fucking ridiculous. I am sick, again. I am always sick! I get sick more often then regular people do! Is it because of my fucking heart condition? Is it because I fucking gave up red meat? Is it because I am fucking anemic?! THIS  IS ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS! 

I need to work. But I dont want to go there and get sent home for contaminating everything. Being sick is so frustrating, I can't handle it. it puts so much stress on me because I have all of these things to do and then I can't do them and if I try, I fail because I feel like crap. It's so humiliating having to call my boss and tell him I can't work. It's so humiliating having to call Jenn and ask her to work for me almost everytime. I dont want her to have to feel bad and go to work. I hate making her work. I hate being sick.

I wish I could just get better. I mean, I have been eating a lot of oranges which equals Vitamin C. I stopped drinking soda. I stopped biting my finger nails. I stopped eating red meat. But I STILL GET SICK!! Why? I really don't know. I guess all I can do is blame it on my fucking heart. I hate my fucking heart. It's going to kill me by the time I am 50 because it such a sucky heart. I just don't fucking understand. WHY DID I HAVE TO BE BORN WITH A RETARDED HEART?!!!!

It's always the same thing. Everytime I get sick, no matter how mild or intense it is, I always have to go to the doctor and get medicine because the shit could end up in my hole and cause a huge infection and I could die. Great to hear that if I was stranded somewhere and caught a cold, and didn't have medicine, my fucking heart would cause the end of my life. Everytime I go and get my teeth cleaned at the dentist, I have to take like 8 pills so that the bacteria doesn't lead to my heart. 

Ventricular Septal Defect is what they call it. I was born with a defect. I am defective.
