Siblings
Siblings can be so annoying. My little half-sister is cute; she's okay. My brother is not. He's a bratty little expletive. I pretty much hate his guts right now. He's the kind of person who won't get up to get his own drink during dinner. He'll force my mother to get up and get him what he wants. He complains in a horrible way and delights in being obnoxious. I complain myself, but my brother is far worse. I know that he's 13 and going through "tough times" because of my parents' (not even that recent) divorce, but he's still so disgusting. I hate it when he comes over to my mother's house and gets to decide what's for dinner. He's such a bwitchoid that my mom will let him decide everything. Apparently, according to my mother, he hates me as much as I hate him. He wishes I weren't here. Too bad, bro, I'm not every staying overnight at my dad's. I was smart enough and old enough to get out of there when I did. So fizz you, bratfrick. 

I hate him, but I don't want him to hate me. Is that stupid? I'm sure it is. He's never been nice to me, at least not for a very, very long time. I don't see why I should try and be nice to him. Still, I wasn't happy to learn that he was spitting out the same vehement feelings towards me that I have for him. I know that what goes around usually comes around, but I still don't like being hated. I know that 13 year old boys aren't known for their good manners and charming personalities, but I can't help thinking that my brother-creature is more obnoxious than most.
