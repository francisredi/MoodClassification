Fuck Indie Rock
I fucking hate that label. People in my band say that we're indie when in all actualality we're nothing but rock/emo rock. I get pissed off about little things like this and it's been really bugging me lately. Bands like Death Cab for Cutie and Modest Mouse are "indie" bands, and I despise everything about those bands.

I need something else in my life musically to make me happy. I've been realizing it more and more often. Maybe it's cause Zach's on vaca and we can't have practice... Or maybe it's cause I'm not entirely happy with my current situation.

Maybe I should take my dad up on his offer and just do music as a hobby/weekend thing. Make a band in which I can play what I feel and not just bs. I need anger in music. Our music doesn't express anger but only sadness.

See, I'm the nicest guy you'll ever meet but I really hate some people. I get angry often about how these people treat others. I NEED THIS TO BE EXPRESSED. if anyone would like to write with me please inform me because I'm not in school and have a lot of free time... and that's what really grinds my gears.
