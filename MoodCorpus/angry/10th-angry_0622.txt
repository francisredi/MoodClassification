so apparently all these crazy peoples are on my case because they think I'm too defiant and I fight too much, with words or whatever it takes. Which is kind of ironic since most people (at school) think i'm a pushover and this quiet kid who obeys the fucking government and rules. yeah, what now bitches. 

but honestly, we all have to fight to survive, whether it be with our words, our fists, or both. there's always a person in our lives who will run all over us if we don't, and mostly it is a parent. or at least that's what i'm guessing. If I didn't fight everything my dad would run all over me, and honestly he'd be a lot worse if I wasn't some defiant bitch. it causes a lot of trouble but at least i'm not some khaki pleated skirt long white sweater, braided hair, ray of fucking sunshine girl with not one ounce of individuality and life left in me, the mold of what this fucking family wants me to be, obeying whatever the hell they say. I can't explain what I'd be like if I let my dad run all over me. i'm sure that's with us all. we're all broken yet not to the point where we've stopped fighting. to the point we can do nothing but fight. 

but these people are pissing me off. 

lallalalalalallalalala! I CAN'T HEAR THEM! LALALALALLAAL. I'M JUST A SWEEEEEET TRANSVESTITE...LET'S DO THE TIMEWARP....lalalalalalala.

well, anger is beginning to recede. slowly.
