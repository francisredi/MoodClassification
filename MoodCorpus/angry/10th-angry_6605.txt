Grrr.
Annoyance is one thing. It's something mild you can mostly ignore. There are two things that annoy me right now.

Still no job;
Still no apartment.

A job would be nice, but I can live without one for the time being, and housing-wise, while I'd prefer a place of my own, I can deal with living with my mother.

On the other hand, the behavior of the parents of my ex aggravates me.

They have started to backpedal on their promises re: helping in the move (as far as we know they will still pay for the van, but I wouldn't count on it),
they have strange ideas about what stuff goes/stays where (like my mother's washing machine, which at no point has been even implied would stay with my ex),
they have absolutely no sensitivity re: trans people (I'm not a "boy", you idiots; you wouldn't mistake me for one, I've mentally never been one, and I'm too old for it), and to top everything off,
apparently there are hidden costs in renting a van through his dad's place of employment. Sure, we knew that there would be a coworker of his driving the van, but now we've heard this would incur an extra fee. Fucking wonderful.

Bfore this my reaction to them would have been neutral. Now... Just keep them away from me. I hate dishonesty and incomplete disclosure in things like this. I also hate their insensititivity. And and and.
