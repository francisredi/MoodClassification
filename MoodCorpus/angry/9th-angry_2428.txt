DSAJL;KGSJDA AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!! yes this is my way of venting. if i randomly screamed right now my parents would yell at me saying: why are you so grumpy and complaining and all that jazz. why?!?! WHY?!?! B/C COMPUTERS SUCK THAS WHY! im so close to just smashing this computer. but i wont, b/c yeah. we NEED&nbsp; new computer. it has diseases and viruses (yes i call them disesases too) and its old and broken down like every other thing i end up owning. ok this music is calming me down some. i want to look at the california pictures. but my computer makes me sad and angry. I WANT TO LOOK AT THE PICTURES GODDAMNIT!! but nooo it says theres no cd in the computer or that the cd is empty. but its NOT! god damnit. my computer sucks. and PEOPLE! so annoying! so.....gahhhhhhhh!!!! i really want to slap ppl that annoy me right in that moment they annoy me, but that would get me suspended from school and/or forced to never see the light of day at home. james blunt can really calm you down. im pretty much done venting. ive faced the fact that computers are made to just disappoint us and never work when you want them to. so pretty much, the world is against me. :)!
