3rd Degree
My parents just chewed me out again.

They're concerned that I won't be able to pay for college, and that I'm not doing enough scholarships.  Which is probably true.  I've been doing them, but not ALL the time, like I suppose I should be.  I just hate doing them so much...they're always the same thing, asking the same questions in a different way so as to not allow me to just keep copying the same junk down.  I hate doing them too because so far I haven't gotten any results from any I've done...I wasted hours on the Boy's State one, and for what?  They all seem so pointless.

And then they get into how, if I go into ministry, I won't be able to pay it back.  Well first they tell me how unwise going straight into ministry is, how I won't be able to find a job and whatever that job pays will be nothing.  If I meet a girl I definitely won't be able to support her on it.  I bring up the fact that I could go to SWYM and not have debt, but then they say that "That's in England.  ENGLAND.  We are not losing you so young".  What do they want?

Then they say how teaching is SUCH a great career and how it would definitely be the best thing for me, and that, gez, I would have no debt and life would be fantastic and just, wow, just so...perfect.  I'm a fool for not thinking so, and for not wanting to be a teacher

I hate to say it, but they really have me doubting what I want to do.  It would be easier to go for education, settle down with a girl and just teach until I die.  At least they might stop putting everything I'm doing down.

I hate this snowday.
