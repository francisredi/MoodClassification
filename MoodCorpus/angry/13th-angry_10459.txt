 Rational and irrational hate for the day.
All day I kept thinking it was Friday. Now I'm going to have to do it all over again. The only good thing is that I took off tomorrow night, the bad thing is that I now have to work two Fridays in a row. Damn, I really hate working Friday nights at the bar.

So Veronica Mars is moving back to Tuesdays? I guess it's good for the show but I don't like it at all. I watch House at that time and on Wendsnesdays I don't have another show to watch.  I thought my Tuesday nights were going to perfect with House and The Amazing Race but some network always has to fuck up my schedule.

Duke lost! I should not be happy about that but it's my ex's alma mater and he's tainted it for me. I also hate  Colorado and Minnesota because we lived in those places when we were married but that's just the irrational part of me. Speaking of the loser, he left a whiny message on my voice mail because I haven't returned any of his phone calls the past month.  The irrational part of me said," I haven't received a child support payment in three years", the rational part of me told me daughter to call her father. She asked me "why?", the irrational part of me said, "so he'll stop calling me because I hate hearing his voice" the rational part of me said, "because he's your father and he misses you." Sometimes I hate having to be an adult.

Off the read 's Seattle Series and wait for Friday to finally get here.
