Of Anger and Weekends
I'm a little angry right now.  At a certain person -- yes, I'm being slightly vague again.  I'm either mad for an actual reason or because I'm in major PMS mode right now.  Wait, does that count as an actual reason?  I'm saying no.  Anyway. . .  Just to let folks know, I'm angry right now.  At a person.

There will be no ranting.  Because then all will be given away and I don't want to deal with that right now.

The sororities downstairs are really, really annoying.  I hate preference night so very much.  At least it's just one night out of every semester.

Oh, and I've decided -- never change things for a boy.  I was originally going to try out for Indoor Drumline and who stopped me from doing that?  Any guesses anyone?  Well, if you know me, you know who I'm talking about.  Now, I have nothing to do on weekends.  'Tis saaaad.  Bah.  I think I've ranted about this before.  No matter -- I need to rant about something and this one is less likely to get me in trouble.  

I can't wait until next weekend.
