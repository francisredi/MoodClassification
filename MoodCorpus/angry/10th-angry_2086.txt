Valentines Day is coming
Ehhhhh valentines day is coming! and i soooo hate valentines day! I really hate it. Its just like another reminder for those who r single that they dont have anyone and they get shit rubbed in their face that they r by themselves. While their friends and family are w/ someone and they r all happy and all that shit. Ugh whatever. I hate people. I hate guys I hate valentines day. Yes i am a lil bitter right now. Get over it! let me vent! ugh!!!!!!!!

And today i was trying to tell someone about stuff that was going on w/ me and they didnt wanna hear it all they really cared about was going out w/ their partner. Thats all they could talk about was their relationship how great it is and how valentines day is going to be great. That was fine and all but when i tried to get back to talking about me and what was going on w/ me they blew up at me! So yea im a lil pissed off. Oh well I'm out of here...ta ta
