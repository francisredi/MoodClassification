Well my wisdom teeth have done their damage... and havent even gotten started yet. They have crowded the top right side of my teeth and now they are all crooked. They are so pushed together that the pressure on my teeth is unbearable. I woke up last night in tears because the pain is so unbearable. I cant sleep, I cant eat. Tylenol does nothing for me. And the funny thing is, I&nbsp; cant do anything about it! Just for a checkup to the dentist, with nothing done, costs $900! I dont have that kind of money! I dont even want to know how much it would cost to have all the work done that I need and the wisdom teeth pulled. My aunt said just for the wisdom teeth to be pulled it costs like 2000. Thats ridiculous. I might just have to take out a loan for this but that fucking sucks because that means ill have to pay that one off before I can get another one for a car. Goddammit. I fucking hate life right now. I hate stupid california and their shitty ass fucking economy and no fucking jobs. I really truly fucking hate it and I want to get the fuck out of here.lkajfslfjdsal;gjdsalgjd ljoidsjglsagdnoidsufsflujsfoidsjtflkwdsnflkjsadfoijlaelfkljdsolfjthats what I have to say.
