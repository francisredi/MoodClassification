RARGH!
I wanna scream. I'm so mad I'm cracking my knuckles almost painfully.

I don't even know why but I'm almost violently angry right now and I'm not sure what's the point. There has been no abuse of liquor or any substances, I'm just like really angry and want to pick a screaming fight right now or just punch someone or hurt them really badly. I just want to shred something up...I just want to bite someone and hear them say 'Ouch.' 

There are just so many people I want to take by the shoulders and shake the fuck out of them and be like...ARGH what the fuck is wrong with you, snap the fuck out of it! No real reason though...it just suddenly struck me as a good idea like it might fix things...it won't.

I'm really really pissed off, I'm grumpy. I mean I was grumpy when I got home and seethed about stupid things like phrases on the phone for a bit. But this, this just came on suddenly like fifteen minutes ago...perhaps MaryLou coffee has finally started to wear on me? Perhaps I've just started to wear on me...is there a full moon? What moon is it? 

*grumble grumble*
