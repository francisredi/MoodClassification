I Hate People
It's official, I hate people.  The last thing I needed tonight was another debt collector calling bitching about wanting money.  Last time they tell me call customer service & they can work out a payment arrangement because you have no income, so , I called them.  Hell no there's nothing they can or will do to work with me.  The only thing they want is $366, & that's just for this month they will still pester the shit out of me for who knows how long.  It's like the phrase I have no income apparently means them that I have money coming in from somewhere to pay them with.  Yeah I wish I had basically $400 in the bank if I did I could pay the car note & the truck note, ha ha real funny.  I have enough stress in my life right now with trying to find work in this black hole of a town, Devin acting up in school, & everything else that's going on right now.  All I want to do is curl up in a dark cave & hide away from everyone.  I hate this town & the people in it.
