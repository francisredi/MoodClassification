The Honors Project from Hell
I hate philosophy.  I don't want to go to graduate school anymore.  I can't do my honors project.  I've been sitting in the lounge all day, and I've accomplished....  Nothing.  I don't want to talk to Prof. Lipscomb about it because he's tired, and I doubt he'd be able to help anyway.  I have no thesis.  No conclusion.  No ideas.  I'm tired.  I hate school.  And I graduate in about a month and a half.  I'm tempted to take next year off and just get a job.  There is no structural unity to my honors project.  I don't know how I managed to spend so many hours up here without getting anything done.  And I'm not exaggerating.  This sucks.  I'm tired.  But I'll probably be up here for a while yet tonight... not getting anything done.  Because I don't know what my honors project is about, in spite of the fact that I've written nearly 50 pages already!!!  There is no thesis.  Thus there can be no conclusion.  And I don't even know if I agree with what I've written so far.  Nor do I know if some of the things I have to say pertain to the thesis, even though they pertain to the topic.  Not an entirely surprising problem considering that there is no thesis.  I hate philosophy.  I hate school.  I hate Houghton.  And in particular, I hate the fourth floor of the Chamberlain Center and everything associated with it.
