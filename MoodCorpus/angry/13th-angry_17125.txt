Florida sucks
Firstly, it is way to damn early for me to be awake.  If I wake up before noon on my own that's one thing.  But if I wake to an alarm I'm not exactly thrilled to around people for a while.  There are times that I sleep through my alarms.  Yes, I sleep through multiple alarms.  If you never got a full nights sleep your body would be telling you to sleep through your alarms too.

There is one thing that always wakes me up.  The phone.  No matter how tired I am I wake up to the phone, I don't always answer it thanks to caller ID.

But this morning, about 25 minutes ago, I got a call.  From Florida, John, John is pretty cool and all but doesn't understand the time difference I think as he has done this before at much earlier hours.  I hate florida but that is like me saying I hate people.  I hate them.  But individuals within the group can be identified and therefor not be hated.  And I don't really hate them.  Its more of a I don't care if they live or die it won't affect my happiness either way.  Sorry it's still a little early for me, I get better around noon or maybe 11am.  So John called to tell me he has made an update two our system, something in the text was wrong or something like that.  Um ok, he has already made the change I could have slept in until my alarm it's in about 45 minutes.  I don't tell him these things, he is a client, have to be nice.  I can't say that if your group had a finalized spec and stopped changing their minds back and forth then we would have these issues.

Now I am going to go back to bed and try to sleep just a couple more hours.
