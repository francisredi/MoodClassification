hi this is jared simmons. i eat lemons. i am vulgarly mad at the world right now so dont ask me whats wrong with myself!!!! because if you do i will tie you in an&nbsp;progressive&nbsp;granny knot and then put you into a box and tie the box with ponderous chains and a figure 8 knot and then i will viciously&nbsp;ship you off into a deserted island remotely near korea. the a&nbsp;massive whale will jump out of the sparkling blue sea water and&nbsp;swallow you whole! the reason i am made at the world if all you people want to know, is because i lost my most VALUABLE yugioh card that i just got last week! it even came with an ultimate special edition cover. i am so mad at mother because i think she threw it away. has she gone mad?!?! i am a champion at yugioh! i will probably not eat or sleep for another month. this is an extreme loss coming from the mind of a champion. people tend to ask me why i love my cards so much, but to tell you the forbidden truth girls have major cooties. and on top of all this madness they arent releasing the DeathJester's Dojo card until next wednesday. but i have to go now because i can NOT miss yugioh x there is going to be a new episode and after that i am watching pokemon!! i cant wait i would die without those shows!! bye
