My LoveHate Relationship
I have a love hate relationship with Spring.  Every spring, as soon as the nicer weather appears, I go into spring cleaning mode.  Yesterday, I went through my clothes and got rid of a whole drawer full of clothes, which is a lot if you've seen the amount of clothes I have versus the amount I actually wear.  I've also been doing well with the whole getting rid of clutter in the room.  Slowly, things are becoming better.

But that's not the problem.

The problem is my mind also decides to go into spring cleaning mode.  And I start to evaluate every relationship I have.  Friends, family, lovers, etc... this can go on for weeks, sometimes straight through until winter.  And it drives me nuts.  And with my recent Rent obsession, its just been astronomically worse.  For the past week, I have been focusing the certain relationships I have and how they have formed me into my current person.  There are days where I just want to tell them to fuck off and get out of my life, but for a million reasons I can't.  I need a damn pensieve to help me sort through everything.  And it makes me have horrible mood swings.  And I feel unstable, and I hate feeling unstable.  

And it's no use to try and distract myself from them - cleaning, working, work outs - they just come back stronger than ever or even haunt me in my dreams.  I mean that too.  I have amazing dreams at night and when I wake up I realize what I want from people, but I refuse to ask because it's not fair to try and make someone change so they meet what I want. And I shouldn't have to. I'm looking for the baggage that goes with mine.  And so goes they cycle.

I hate spring sometimes.  I really do...
