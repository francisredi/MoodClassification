So I just realized something:  As much as I despise my mom, I hate myself-when-I'm-around-her more.  I have put up with her bull for so long, I'm just sick of it now, and I get soo incredibly pissed off that I am completely transparent around her.  I stop myself from flipping out at her, but it is so clear that I'm pissed and annoyed and hate her that it makes me sick. Around anyone else I can choose what emotion I show, but not around her.  Once in a great while, if I had an amazing day, I can make myself only seem slightly annoyed around her, but other than that, I make it extremely clear that she annoys the crap out of me.  But me being transparent isn't even the worst of it.  I am so sick of the crap that she does, that I get unreasonably pissed and annoyed and hateful, even when my mind is telling me that it is ridiculous.  I can be having a fine time doing whatever, and the minute she walks into the door I get this horribly annoyed feeling.  Its preemptive.  And it sucks.  If I could just be fair about it, she could take her time in pissing me off, and then I could have more time to control myself.  But I cant.  And it makes me so immature and closed-minded. Every time she opens her mouth, I know its going to be something mean, or judgmental, or redundant, but then I'm just pre-judging her. So now, I'm pissed at her and myself, instead of just at her like normal.  I hate being at home.
