Last Night
Last night Franki got mad becuase of the studid bloody game.  I had already told Chris I couldn't play late - he said he wasn't sure he could make it a short session, and we'd wait and see what time Franki got back.  I had assumed it was going to be around 6:30, as he class started at 5:30 and she didn't say anything about it runninglater or anything.  Bad judgement on my part.  Franki comes home at 7:30, spends half and hour on the phone, and then gets mad becuase at 8 with only two hours to play Chris has decided it's not worth doing.  I'm sorry, I can't keep staying up until 1:30 becuase of a stupid bloody game.  It's a bloody GAME  Franki, it's not the end of the world, and we just played the night before (hence WHY I needed to not play late...)  And Franki comes down on me becuase it's "the only thing I have to look forward to..."  Excuse me, did you not just go to a bloody yoga class that you've been excited about all week?  And now you come home and get mad at me becuase I've decided that my being able to sleep is a little more important than a bloody game?  And yes, you're right, I could bow out early and miss the last hour or two of the game like I always fucking do, which is getting really fucking old.  Then we spend the first half an hour of the next bloody game catching me up.  So forgive me for being bloody selfish that I want to play WITH you guys and not miss half the bloody game and be able to sleep in addition.  It's fine for you - the nights you do sleep here instead of Chris's place, the two of you are up late giggling which only serves to remind me how very fucking along I am.  So forgive me for taking away "the only thing you have to look forward to" even though you have this class you really like, a boyfriend who would do anything for you, a direction in your life, etc etc.  Guess what?  I took away the only thing I have to look forward too, in favour of my health.  Call us even.
