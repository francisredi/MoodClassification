Such Flab
Ewww, I hate it I hate it I hate it.

I ate soooo much today, and it's only 1:22. It's absolutely disgusting. An apple, four cookies, some sparkling cider, and a whole fucking can of pringles. Ewwww. And there's about 10 calories in each freaking chip. Not to mention I've been feeling sick yesterday and today, so I've just been sitting on the couch, so I've probably gained a billion pounds. When I checked the scale this morning, I had gained two pounds, and so I'm kind of scared to even imagine how much I'd weigh after what I've eaten. Bleeech. I wouldn't mind as much if it were healthy foods, or even neutral foods, but this horrible junkfood shall be the cause of my demise, I just know it.

At least I got my exercise walking the streets of NYC. That's a plus. I'm guessing we walked an average of...maybe 10 miles a day I guess? So at least something's on my side. Bah. I must banish all junkfood from this household, which is getting harder and harder to do, since my mom keeps bringing home Pringles. So far in the past month, we've gone through 6 Pringle cans. It's absolutely disgusting. And my mom made Gingersnaps. Why must she be such a good cook? >:O

Well this is just no fun at all. Two pounds. Hmm, maybe I can transfer them over to Kevin. Wouldn't that be a blast? >.<
