Pills...Pills...Pills...
Well, I was up most of last night, as expected, I couldn't sleep. I ended up taking an Ambien in addition to the 2 Sonata. I ended up feeling really sick and throwing up, I thought it was just because I took the extra meds, but I'm sick as hell today too. I think its side effects from my new meds. I fucking hate taking meds. They always make me sick, and they never make me feel better. Actually, as much as I HATE to admit it, I think I am feeling a little better. I don't feel suicidal as much. Although, I did cut myself the other day, I started smoking cigarettes again and I've been sleeping so much I haven't really had time to think about being depressed. So, maybe I haven't really been feeling all that great. PLUS, I found out at my appointment with Patty today that she is going to be leaving the clinic, so I will have to start seeing a new therapist which sucks, not only because I'll have to start over but because Patty was like the best therapist I've ever had. It was so great to finally work with someone that actually wanted to help me. I felt like maybe I would actually get somewhere in my treatment, like maybe there was still some hope for me... but that is now fading fast. My psychiatrist is an idiot. She could care less about me, or if I ever get better. She doesn't care about any of the side effects that I'm having from all of this shitty medications either. She has no clue what shes doing. She's diagnosed me with shit that has nothing to do with the symptoms I'm having. I think she should take the money that shes gotten from her free medical degree here in the states and buy a ticket back to India. I hate foreign doctors. Especially stupid ones. Well, I'm getting bored with typing this, maybe I'll write more later.
