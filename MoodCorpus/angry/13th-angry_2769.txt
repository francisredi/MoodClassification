I hate g-d damn rich people. I hate them. I hate those mother fucking rich son of a bitches. yes I am saying that out loud. I hate them, I hate their privilege dominate lifestyle. I want to piss on their lawns and steal their children.

Its been a long day. Like a long fucking slightly gray slug uphill

It started with arriving at the kennel in a flurry. It included 11 bloody people in a tour designed to fit 8. There was some fucking TV star none of us knew or gave a shit about on the tour. I don't give a fuck if you work on TV, I give a fuck if you weigh more then 150 and wear fucking Ugg boots. No one on the crew lives with TV, and most of us live without running water. Quit treating me like a g-d damn freak you rich son of a bitch. I am not some freak in a cage, watch carefully, I might do a trick. Fuck you. Fuck you and your fur coat, bratty entitled dominating children, your over sized SUV, your third house in North Carolina, your 25'000 dollar ski vacation. I ought to leave your sorry fat ass out here in the mountains. Spend a night at ten thousand feet under a full moon thinking about your pitiful existence and what matters. 'O the day also included a lost wallet (found thank G-d), a skunk spraying, a stuck truck, snow drifts ten feet high, a walking washing machine, getting cut off on the highway at the top of Dallas divide.

I fucking hate rich people.
