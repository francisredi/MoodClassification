Alright I know its been a seriously long time but I need to grip and who better to grip to then a fairly anonymous group of friends and strangers over a public journal?
No one thats who.

Anyway back to the point. I've noticed that there is a huge problem with communication in this dorm. Not to the extreme of my ex-roommate emailing me to switch rooms or anything, but there is a lot of anger and pissy attutudes floating around that need to be resolved WITH THE PEOPLE YOU ARE PISSED AT! That is, NOT ME! 

Unless of course I've done something to anger you. Then, by all means, tell me whats wrong and I will do my best to act like I care before putting my headphones on and going back to work. 

The thing is that everyone is mad at someone but no one is willing to confront it.
I dont really care if you harber your anger and hatred for all enternity as long as you don't come to me expecting me to agree with you. I am not your yes man. 

And dont get mad at me for telling you what I think. If you didnt want to know DON'T ASK!

Hint: If you are mad at them there is a good chance they are mad at you too.
Hint 2: If you have a problem with someone on campus, especially in the Honors dorm it is highly likely that they are my friends and I will tell them everything you have told me.

If that doesnt stop your whinning how about this? For every minute of my life you waste with your petty little problems I will charge 5 dollars and for every breath I waste giving you the same advice as I gave before("TELL THEM HOW YOU FEEL AND STOP BEING A PUSSY!") I will charge 20 dollars. Sound fair? I think so.

PS: By the way this only applies to a select group of people. I love my friends and am willing to listen if you really want my help. There are just a few people with the same tired issues who dont listen anyway. If you have a real problem please feel free to tell me about it but dont expect me to pick a side.
