Okay so from Marc's floor, only Marc and I went to Tilt. I got there and realized I forgot my ID so we had to drive back to RIT and then go back to Tilt. As for Tilt, we danced, good times and all, but all I could think of was how bad I dance. I was too afraid to really get my arms in the air or anything. Oh and I do NOT like Marc's friends Matt and Tim, even if they are decent individuals. I'm just a fucking hateful bitch, as evidenced by other attitutdes I've had this night. I did NOT have fun tonight but I totally feigned my happiness and Marc, as far as I could tell, wasn't able to see through my act. I am so fucking angry at gays, those that do drugs and those that drink. Gays are fucking sluts. Drugs and alcohol are damn well lame and fucked up. I HATE all these people that just think it's fine and dandy to be doing this shit.

Guess what, no one could tell that I'm fucking angry. Thoughts of breaking up with Marc run rampant in my mind 'cause I'm just that big of an angry bitch. Oh and here's some faking it on AIM in order to throw off Marc in case he thought I didn't have a good time.

Goodnight sweetie, hehe. Hope you had a good night, I know I did. ^.^

And for the finishing touch: night marc 

I so fucking dislike him right now and he has no fucking clue, yay!

Did I mention that I'm a bitch? How about that I'm 'evil'?
