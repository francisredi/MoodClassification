Some people make me so mad!!!  They call themselves Christians, then they are complete jerks to the so called "geeks"...They are in their little group talking with their friends when a "geek" walks up and tries to join the conversation.  After rolling their eyes at the person, they either completely ignore them, walk away, or mention some inside joke that causes everybody to laugh but the "geek". They even go to the extent to talk about what their plans are this weekend, and when this person asks what's going on, they say "oh nothing" or roll their eyes yet again.  (Note: I was not the the "geek" in this instance, I merely witnessed this happed to another poor soul.)  It just makes me mad that they consider themselves so nice and such good Christians, and then neglet the very people that they should be witnessing to.  Oh yeah, don't even get me started about the new kids that leave because people are mean to them.  What about the non-Christians who come to SCS?  If the people at SCS aren't any different from the public school crowd, and the new kid gets made fun of or neglected, do you think their perception of a Christian is going to very good?  We have to remember who we represent as a CHRISTIAN school and maybe consider the non-Christians that may be watching us.  Anyway...I could go on forever, but I guess I'll stop.  Sorry if this made you mad, but it needed to be said.  To bad the people that need to read this don't even know I have an lj, and if they did wouldn't read it anyway.  Uuuuggghhh.  I'm out.
