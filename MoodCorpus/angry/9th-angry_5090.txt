i got pulled over for the THIRD time on wednesday, fun times. im just on a fucking role, let me tell youuuu. 3 times within what, 3 months? christ. im wreckless. 

so about this massive snow storm coming our way?? i fucking hope its not bad bc i dont want to be stranded home on a perfectly good saturday night. thats my only night i can go out. grr. 

im pmsing so bad this week, its outa control. i had a screaming match with my mom yesterday b4 work, well, actually i was the only one screaming. she gets me so angry sometimes i swear i want to kick her in her ovaries. 

so my brother is bringing his gf to the city to see a ballet tonight, hes too much. i swear, he LOVES to spend money. i dotn want to even know how much he spent on those tickets, supposedly they were sold out but he still managed to get 2. now hes ironing his pants and cursing himself out bc hes a spaz and cant iron correctly. christ.
