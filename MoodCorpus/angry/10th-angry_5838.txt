He is EXACTLY why I hate the Olympics.
Yeah, I said it HATE THE OLYMPICS. 
Number one, it's a sports event. That right there takes it down a notch.
Number two, They try SO hard to talk about the honor and prestige of being in the Olympics, but it's really all about the cash.
Number three, it fucks up TV for WEEKS.
and number four, it gives people like Johnny Weir a reason to even exist.

See he was just on the news. Talking about how when he is in competitions he likes to have his room 'just so', with his candles and his step in shower, and how horrible it was to be roughing it with a tub and a hose with a little head on it for a shower.....

SHUT UP YOU SELF ABSORBED FAGGOT. If the image of him on the front of his website doesn't make you hate men, his attitude will. What a little Prima Dona of the Ice! He isn't a Sportsman, he's a queen with a pair of skates. 

Boxing is about the only sport I can respect... Beat the shit out of each other, last one standing wins. THAT I can understand. Dressing up like Tinkerbell The $2 Whore and fliting about the ice isn't....
