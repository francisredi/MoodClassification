my superpowers are fading away...
work kicked my ass today. physically and emotionally. all i want to do is workout (weights) but i cant find the motivation or energy. i even ate a bowl full of gruel (lentil soup w/ every vegetable in the joint chopped up in it) to up my protein instead of french fries or bagels (what the others on staff usu. throw on the table after the shifts over). no dice. still tired. work was also pretty depressing today. the usual drama happened, there were screams and flying plastic dishes and the usual, but that wasnt even the kicker. this dude, i guess you can call him my coworkers husband, came in and freaked out. to make a long story short this guy used to work at amy's place awhile back for a hot second and so today he came to yell at the boss for scheduling "his wife" too much. ok. 1) its her own damn life so she can yell at the boss if she wants to herself 2) she came in for her shift hours tonight w/ a bruised eye 3) this scumbucket made the fur stand up on the back of my neck so high that i wanted to physically fight him on the spot. you know, if youve been around an abuser at some time in your life, you can just feel it a million miles away. i havent felt so viscerally enraged in quite a long time. all this anger and i *still* cant get up the energy to work out. maybe if i take a nap i can calm down and re-focus my rage. sounds like a plan.
