This morning I have decided that I hate my boyfriend.

We were walking back from the dining hall and joking around about getting with other people over break and when I told him that the black man with a 14inch penis he was "going to pay to rape me if I got with anyone" would never find me because I'd be at so many different boys house's...he smacked the cup of hot coffee in my hand into my face causing the entire cup to completely cover my hair, face, and jacket in discusting organic dining hall coffee.

And he..till this minute..does not understand why I won't speak to him.

Well considering you will read this jon:

I am very mad at you because you are a horrible boyfriend who splashed coffee into my face and I am going to sleep with boys over break for real just because you did that to me. I now smell like discusting organic coffee grounds which smells similar to a rotting log covered in maple syrup and marshmellows( because you had to throw those into my coffee because you want me to be fat) ..and the log is also on fire. That is what I smell like. And I hate you for it. 
To the point where I want to pour this lovely coffee into your eyes and then kick you in the balls.and give you aids.


love always,
jessika.
your ex-girlfriend.
