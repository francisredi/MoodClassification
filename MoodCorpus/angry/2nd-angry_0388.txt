Me? Angry? nahhh.
Great. Just fan-fucking-tastic. I might not be able to go to the December event because of grades. Mrs. Solheim won't let me turn in my morning pages late, so I'm fucked. I am NOT missing another event because of her bullshit. Why did Scharl have to leave? She abandoned lit mag, as well as Mike and I. *Sigh* I seriously want to drop out of high school, get a job, and just get on with my fucking life. I'm sick of all this grade bullshit and teenage drama. I might be leaving Avalon for a bit anyway, and I want this event, which is most likely my last event, to be fun. But now I may not be able to even go. There goes $250 for that dress, there goes learing to waltz again, there goes ACTUALLY HAVING FUN AT AN EVENT FOR ONCE. Home sucks too. I can't even get a glass of milk without my dad going off on me about my weight. He never ceases to find something to bitch about. Christmas is going to be just dandy. This time of year is always hell...someone save me. Rocky Horror fell through last night because everyone decided that it would be better to go see Rent, which they can see any time. Rocky Horror is only once a semester, but no. Fucktards...meh. Whatever. I don't even care anymore. I miss Steve. I hate that he's 3 hours away. I hate that he's never here when I need him, and I can't even yell at him about it because it's not his fault. He does his best, and he loves me, but it doesn't change the fact that I miss him. *Sigh* Someone shoot me? Please? Cuz that would be great right about now. Maybe not to kill, maybe just enough to give me a little vacation in the ER. 

I'm just sick of being me.
