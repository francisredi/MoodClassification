Fuck fuck fuck in a handbasket.  I forgot to balance the check I wrote to my parents for my car a few weeks ago, so now our checking account is overdrawn.  And because of Jeremy's books, filling up the cars, and for some reason spending way too much on groceries, our Discover bill is huge.  We'll probably have to carry a balance into next month - which I HATE.  I hate paying interest.  And then there's all the other bills this month.  And with my hours only just getting back to full time, I don't know how we're going to get through this month.

If I'd balanced that one stupid check I would have seen where we were at and wouldn't have spent so much money on stupid shit.  Dammit.  How did this even happen?  I have NEVER missed a balance like that.

Ruin, all is in ruin.

At least my mom is letting us push back the car payment this month until I can get my shit together.  I don't know how the charge bill got so HIGH.  I don't even recognize most of the shit on it.  I think we're going to have to keep all the charge bills so it doesn't get away like that again.  That's never happened to me before.  :(

I'm always so careful, I don't know what happened.  I'm so mad at myself.

I guess it won't be the end of the world, but now I have a mess to clean up.  At least we're set on food for awhile.  Though we both need new nice clothes for a wedding this month.  :(

So.  So.  Stupid.
