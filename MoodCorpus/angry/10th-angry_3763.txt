Tyler can't read this one, so I'm gonna say what is really on my mind. I hate I really mean hate his dad. His dad is a I can't even begin to say what I want to about him, because there are no words in any language that could possible describe how horribe of a person he is. I don't wanna move in until he's gone! I don't think that I can. I can't stand him. He's a creep. He lies to his kids, to his ex-spouse, and probably everyone else in the freakin world. I know so much shit about him that Tyler's mom has told me and I can't tell Tyler, or the others. I don't want to break that promise to Cyndi. It's just really hard because I don't like keeping that secret from Tyler. Today I just wanted to take a baseball bat and beat him in his lumpy bald head, then in his kidneys and make him piss his pants. I know that I'll get lectured over saying that I hate him by someone, but I wouldn't say it unless I meant it. Trust me, I mean everything that i have said so far. I have never felt this much passionate hate for anyone. Not anyone. I'm still really upset about the whole ordeal that happened today. That's when I finally told Tyler that I don't like his dad. I don't have the heart to say that I hate him. I can't do it. I eventually will though. I'm still so pissed off that I'm shaking. I can't help it. I just need some time to vent and cry. I won't though. I won't cry, or vent. It won't happen. It never does. I have to keep everything bottled up inside, and when it all gets full, it fizzes out. Normally on the people that don't deserve to get screamed at. Normally writing all my feelings down helps, but not right now. It seems to be getting worse. Once again, I hate Tyler's dad.

AS with my xanga, please don't talk to Tyler or I about this, I just used this as a way of venting, and I don't want to bring it up again. If you want to leave a message, its ok, just don't talk to Tyler about it.
