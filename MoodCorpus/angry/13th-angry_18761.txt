Rage
ARGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

Why must I always come home only to be greeted with bad news, or to be asked over and over again about my opinions on my mother's worst-case-scenarios for our family's future, and then sit try to reassure her that we are not going to be rendered homeless anytime soon (well I hope not anyway)...?

And why do fucking junkies feel the need to throw used syringes into the backyard of our (old) house?! Makes me angry because I worry about having a family with young children moving in there. Lovely quaint little home, marred by the stupid giant, open driveway for the townhouses next door, that runs down the entire length of the property. I think this is the main source of my rage tonight.

I'm beginning to worry that we won't be able to afford a decent place to live, and that I'm doomed to never have any personal space ever again. This in effect will drive me to more rage-filled ourbursts than usual. 

I've also got two assessments due this week that I haven't started; work tomorrow night that I can't get out of; a stupid staff meeting at 8PM on Wednesday night; plus my neck is really sore from whacking head on the rock yesterday (whiplash).

Anyway, I should start some research on the speech I have to do about injections. How fucking appropriate.
