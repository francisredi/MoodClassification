Glad I have livejournal
I am so fucking glad I have a livejournal, it allows me to do this without getting things taken away...

FUCK YOU MOM, YOU ARE A FUCKING TWIT AND EVERYTHING YOU TOUCH TURNS TO SHIT, AND YOU WONDER WHY I SAY "DON'T TOUCH ME" ALL THE TIME.  YOU FUCKING RUIN EVERYTHING I TRY WITH YOUR FUCKING MESSED UP VIEW OF LIFE, I CAN'T WAIT TO MOVE OUT SO I NEVER HAVE TO TALK TO YOU AGAIN, I WON'T ANSWER YOUR CALLS, I WON'T ANSWER THE DOOR WHEN YOU DROP BY.  I WANT YOU OUT OF MY FUCKING LIFE, YOU MAKE MY LIFE MISERABLE, YOU TELL ME ONE THING AND DO ANOTHER, YOU DON'T HAVE ANY RESPECT FOR THINGS I HOLD DEAR, HOWEVER STUPID THEY MAY BE, IF I LOVE THEM, KEEP YOUR FUCKING HANDS OFF THEM.  YOU SHOULD KNOW YOU ARE NUMBER 2 ON MY MURDER LIST, DOESN'T THAT MAKE YOU THINK YOU SHOULD CHANGE HOW YOU TREAT ME? I NEED TO GET AWAY FROM YOU, YOU ARE KILLING ME WITH YOUR STUPIDITY.  YOU MAKE ME WANT TO WRAP THIS ROPE AROUND MY NECK, TIE IT TO THE ROOF, AND JUMP OFF.  ISN'T IT SAD THAT I LOVE MY CHEMICAL ROMANCE MORE THAN I LOVE YOU? I CAN'T TRUST YOU OR CONFIDE IN YOU, I CAN'T EVEN FUCKING HUG YOU.  YOU NEED TO GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME, I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU.  I CAN'T STAND YOU, YOU ARE A FUCKING BITCH AND I CAN'T BE AROUND YOU ANYMORE, I FUCKING HOPE YOU GET TO SEE THIS SOMEDAY, YOU PROBABLY NEVER WILL, BUT OH HOW I WISH YOU WOULD, JUST SO YOU CAN KNOW THE ANGST YOU HAVE CAUSED ME, I HATE THAT I FEEL THIS WAY ABOUT MY OWN MOTHER, IT SHOULDN'T BE SO, BUT IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF YOU, YOU HAVE RUINED ME, AND YOU CAN LIVE THE REST OF YOUR DAYS WITH THIS GUILT OVER YOUR HEAD, DON'T EVER EXPECT ME TO KEEP IN TOUCH, BECAUSE I WON'T, THE MINUTE I GET OUT OF THIS HOUSE YOU WILL NEVER HEAR FROM ME AGAIN, YOU MIGHT AS WELL TELL EVERYONE I HAVE DIED, I CAN'T WAIT TO PULL OUT OF THE DRIVEWAY FOR THE LAST TIME, LOOKING STRAIGHT INTO YOUR EYES, KNOWING THAT I'LL NEVER HAVE TO LOOK INTO THEM AGAIN.  I WON'T EVEN SAY GOODBYE FOR THE LAST TIME, YOU DON'T DESERVE THE COURTESY.  

Okay, I feel better now.
