I'm a breeder baby, so why don't you kill me...
okay, why are there so many assholes in the world? I was surfing the Urban Dictionary, and came across 'breeders'. I can't help being straight, trust me, I've tried, and while I haven't dated every type of girl, I just can't get into it; it's kind of depressing, since I've met so many more women who wanted to have a relationship with me than men.&nbsp; And yes, I have kids (two).&nbsp; One for each of us, as it were.&nbsp; And while there's a sentimental part of me that wants to have more, I am so not going to do it.&nbsp; Kids are a lot of work, a lot of pain, and definately can be annoying.&nbsp; It's not something fore everyone, and I refuse to encourage couples to have any; it's a choice that's not mine to make.I can see getting mad at people who have too many kids and don't take care of them (as in the #1 definition of breeder, as opposed to breeder_s_).&nbsp; I get mad at those people, and wish we had to pass mental health exams or something, maybe an IQ test, before anyone was allowed to have babies.&nbsp;&nbsp; And I know how angry and upsetting being insulted/derided can be (i'm a pagan, socialist&nbsp;feminist and have been attacked verbally as well&nbsp;as physically&nbsp;for not hiding my existance).&nbsp; &nbsp;But I still can't see how calling an entire group a name is really a mature way of responding to insults.&nbsp; it's letting one goup of assholes turn your group into assholes as well.and it also completely ignores the homosexual couples who want and either adopt or bear children of their own.&nbsp; Does that mean certain lesbians and gays are 'breeders' too?&nbsp; It's stupid.&nbsp; Fear and anger are always a nasty mix, and it makes me angry and hurt to know that in spite of all the support I have for my gay and bi friends, I get the automatic 'married with kids?&nbsp; must be a vanilla prude who hates everything!'&nbsp; Okay, it doesn't hapeen every day, but when I come across this kind of crap, I just want to scream.why pick on all straight people; ?&nbsp; it doesn't make sense, but then, like I said right at the beginning of this rant, there are assholes in this world; I just don't like being reminded of them!
