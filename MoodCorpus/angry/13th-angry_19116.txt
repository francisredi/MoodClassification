if u don't know then don't open your mouth
there is one thing that i hate the most.....is when people talk about me to others about every problem that i have or i am going through.. pretty much if i want someone to know how i feel or what i'm going through then i will tell them myself.  i also hate when people think that i'm not a fashion designer because all i do is look through magazines. the thing is i'm wanting to be a fashion illustrator not designer. Illustrator designs the damn clothes for the designer. For example: a person that is doing advertising. the person that does the art work for the advertisement company is what an fashion illustrator does for the designer.  I hate when people think i'm judging them when i'm not, but they automatically judge me with no problem. i might be sounding like a bitch when i write but what i write about is how i  have felt about situations that i find out and i hate. i got to see the man i love practice his bass, then watched him practice with the other band members, and well lets just say i'm not happy, and now i'm having second thoughts(but it does have anything to do with eh one i love)and lets leave it at that.
