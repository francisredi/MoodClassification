I'm starting a new and better life!
Things have become so complicated lately! I've been upset about a lot of things, but most of the issues have been involving one of Josteins friends who has been behaving in a manner I don't approve of. I'm not going to go into detail. I've been annoyed with many things he's done and I've been using a lot of time and energy on just being angry and annoyed. All this erupted on my birthday when the three of us were in Trondheim and I had the worst birthday ever, but that's okey. I'll have another one next year and it will be great I tell you! 

It got even worse after the party on friday, when he brought a date and then decided to leave with someone else and just leave her there. She had to stay over and I had to be nice to her and take care of her eventhough she was very drunk and kept harazing my guests. 
I'm furious with him and have decided I really don't want to see him again, at least not in 2005. I haven't told him so since I haven't had the chance, but I think I'm just going to try and forget all about it. Ignore him totally. I really want to tell Jostein that he's no longer welcome in my home. He can apologize and I will forgive him, but until them I'm going to try to pretend he doesn't exist. 

I'll use all the anger to paint. I have the weekend all to myself and I'll set up my stuff and start painting on saturday. It will be great! I'll stop bugging Jostein about how angry I am with this guy. I'll also stop bugging everybody else about it. This is not important enough for me to waste energy on. 

Sound like a good plan?
