Parents and adults seem to make us teens mad all the time.
My example INFURIATES me.
My parents(except my dad) donttake me seriously, and it really makes me mad, its mostly my mom and my stepdad. I have been living in my house for 15 years now, we moved there when i was 2. my mom is soon getting married to this guy named doug in May, so he will soon be my stepdad. We have a 2 car garage, and i just got a car about 2 months ago. I have been parking in the garage ever since i got the car. I had to clean out the garage to make room for my car, since we only had one car in there for a long time(my moms).
Doug just told me, "thanks for cleaning out my parking spot", i was like, what?, he told me he will be parking there when he moves in. My mom has been telling me my car takes up too much space, and she needs to squeeze through there all the time. But doug has a big F-150 truck, twice the size of my little sedan. I told my mom that if he gets my spot i will be Furious, and she said, Evan, doug is an adult and he will be my husband soon. IM YOUR SON, YOU HAVE KNOWN ME FOR 17 YEARS. YOU ONLY HAVE KNOWN DOUG FOR 2!!!. 
Also, it makes me madder, because we have had lots of car robberies in my neighborhood in the past month. I just spent my whole life savings on my car, so if it gets stolen, or robbed or broken, i will have NOTHING!! My car already has 160,000 miles on it, and a garage-kept car lasts longer, so i need the garage. And they make me so mad. 
Also, My brother dinged my car once while walking through, and i told him he better pay for it, doug overheard me and started laughing. Ill bet youll be laughing if i scratched up your truck wouldnt you??? so ya, that makes me mad!!
