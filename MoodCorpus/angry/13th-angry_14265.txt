how i hate being alone on march 31-april 2
Hay! I am so angry at mom! As usual, she did not allow me to go to Mindy's beach bday party in Tali. Wow. That's new. Hay. Puta. I already expected her answer to be NO even if I didn't tell her about it. That's how my mom is. Lahat DEPENDE, DEPENDE, DEPENDE!! I think she is OVER as in OVERPROTECTIVE sakin. Maybe because I am her eldest daughter and I will be the one who will&nbsp;bring up&nbsp;my family to a better living. And another thing is that I dont think she trusts me that much. For God's sake, she wouldn't even allow me by myself to open her back compartment of her car because I might open the doors of the car!! The hell?? Marunong din naman ako magingat!! Mom, you need to trust your eldest daughter a&nbsp;little bit more. Or a lot more! Back again about Mindy's bday party.. I gave her all the reasons so that she will allow me to go. But nooooo! And she always use this tactic on me whenever I am asking for her permission!&nbsp;That is why it is so hard for me to ask for her permission. Kailangan right timing pa!&nbsp;Tangina, 3 days of non-stop fun, lying and playing under the sun, enjoying the beautiful scenery and the BEACH and hanging out with your very best friends!! Maybe this&nbsp;will be our once in a lifetime opportunity to go out somewhere far, far and enjoy, enjoy, enjoy!!! And now its all gone for me!!&nbsp;At least I still get to go to other&nbsp;parties and invitations&nbsp;given to me. Still, SAYANG!!! How I hate her.
