Goddamn I hate it when I get stood up. pretty people would have no idea what i'm talking about but the rest of you would know. everyone has heard this one before - hey I'll call you when I'm gonna leave and then you can meet me there. but then what happens, they don't call and then at like two in the morning you get a call, hey I'm so sorry, I came home from work and fell asleep but we'll go somewhere next weekend. w/e. liar. bastard. gee wiz I'm angry. what is the point of making plans if you're just gonna back out at the last minute. then i hate calling because i feel like a stalker and kinda like a lame loser. like those people that don't have friends and when they finally do have plans they're bugging everyone to make sure that the plans are still on that night. lame. yeah, definetly not goin now. *rage*. i have that conversation running through my head - should i call, should i wait, maybe i should wait, i'll give him a half an hour more, should i call, maybe ten more minutes, maybe he'll call me if i wait a little longer, i'll wait, i wanna call, when should i call, i'll call now, well maybe not right now. ugh. i really like this guy too and this whole night was his f'ing idea!
