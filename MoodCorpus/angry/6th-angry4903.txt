angry biology rant revisited
i just put this on myspace, but im so angry i will post it here as well.

begin angry rant *biology is nothing but memorizing. memorize this list of crap.  why? because it will be on the test! NOO you don't need to understand it... and NOOOO... we won't be calculating anything relating to that graph based on kinetics... just memorize it!  I want to see the calculations and why that intersection point is equal to 1/kd. I never thought i would miss calculus and math.... oh! and who came up with this naming? holy shit.  give me a break.  try to be organized people.  we are just going to keep tacking the word KINASE onto the end of every protein that phoshorylates even when we realize there are a million of them.  its KINASE KINASE KINASE. FUCKING KINASE. ooooh and just so you know, they all have another name because the researchers couldnt decide on one?! someone needs to come up with a better system. (like IUPAC naming for biology?) argh. *end rant*
sorry mostly i am sick of studying this cascade pathways. 
i appologize to any of the non-stupid biologists out there, who must agree with me to qualify.
