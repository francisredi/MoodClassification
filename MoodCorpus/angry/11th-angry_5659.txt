FUCK!
I'm actually crying right now because I'm stuck in Santa Fe for the weekend.

All I want to do is come down to Albuquerque and see my favorite people, and I'm fucking stuck here all fucking weekend until Tuesday, and I don't know how often I'll be able to come after that due to money being tight. 

What makes it worse is that Nicq will be out late with his D&D crap, and he's working tomorrow. So I'm completely alone this weekend, and the Park & Ride doesn't run on Sundays, and I didn't go today because nobody let me know if they even wanted to see me in Albuquerque.

I HATE THIS FUCKING GODDAMN PIECE OF SHIT MOTHERFUCKING CITY AND EVERYONE IN IT, I DON'T FUCKING WANT TO BE HERE ANYMORE! I WANT TO SEE MY FUCKING FRIENDS AND I DON'T WANT TO PLAY D&D TO FUCKING MEET PEOPLE, I AM ALL FUCKING ALONE TONIGHT IN A CITY I HATE AND I FUCKING HATE IT!!!!!!!!!!!

PLEASE...if any of my friends in Albuquerque get this, please call me, please talk to me, because I am so lonely right now it fucking hurts.

That is, if you don't hear from me first.

I fucking hate this. I HATE THIS, AND I DON'T WANT TO BE HERE!
If anyone in Albuquerque finds a car, please, feel free to come see me. I would LOVE the decent company.
