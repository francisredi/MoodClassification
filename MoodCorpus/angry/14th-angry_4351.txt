so here is the deal , i had told my boyfriend rodigo , that i was gonna be home alone today in the morning , since my parents were going to a soccer game w my little bro , so he calls me around 9 this morn n tells me that hes on his way , well i was obiously asleep by this time, but i knew that i had to wake up , before he got to my house , by 11 he calls me n tells me that he was here , n he was in the pool , so i get up n start to get ready , but i see my brother still sleeping there , n so r my parents in their room , well i still dress up , n tell him to give me ten mins , to get ready , like i had expected hes is mad @me , n my parents were getting up. So he is up in my room w me for just about 30 mins , till my dad says that we have to go , so we leave n he goes to the hair cuttery, i spend the whole entire day shpping n hanging out w my parents , whcih by the way i haven't done in the last couple of weeks , since i've been w my friends n boyfriend, well just about 10 mins ago i had the frist actual argument w rodrigo , beacuse he wanted to hang out w me , n i wasn't there , n cuz his mom , is mad @me since he comes to my house evry saturday
well now i don't know how this might end up
but am going out of town on monday , n i'll be gone for a while 
so this suxs alot
n i hate it
i wish i would have told him 
that we don't always have to be together
well 
now  i fucked up 
n there is nothing i can do about it
oh n am under pressure again
great 
this suxs
alot
