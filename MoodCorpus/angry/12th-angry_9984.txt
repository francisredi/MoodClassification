I am so annoyed. Everything annoys me. Everything bothers me to the point where i just want to crack. i know i should be grateful to be living in this house and dont get me wrong, I am. But when it comes to the point where everyone is all up in my shit, i just hate it. My whole life I have never had a little brother or a sister to grow up with. and now that I live with something similar to it, im just NOT used to it. I hate it that when im not here everyone just comes in the room without permission and do whatever the fuck they want to do in here. You know its like fuck man its either they want to use the fucking computer or play a stupid video game. It gets on my fucking nerves. They have their own room and their own computer to use. I hate it. I want to put a lock but at the same time its not my house, its carmens and she makes the rules so i cant ddo much of it. She doesnt want to put a lock on the door because its a sliding door. At least i would like the respect of privacy and the respect of RESPECTING what bothers me. I hate coming home and the kids are in the room. I dont want them in this room when no one is here. and i cant stress it enough but kids these days dont listen to anyone anyways. and then one of them annoys me to the point where i get frustrated and then she says i treat her bad when i dont. its just that im tired man fuck. sometimes im just not in the mood to deal with shit. sometimes i just want to be alone.
