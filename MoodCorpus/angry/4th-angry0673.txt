New Year
It's a new year in a couple of hours and I am at home with my mom and dad. I have no parties to go to or anything. Next year I shall have a party. I'll invite a bunch of my friends. Well, the ones that aren't on the band trip. le sigh. I am tired of not having any fun. I mean the little simple things make me happy, but being almost alone here at home is kind of depressing. 

I think the real reason I am upset is cause my mom is watching the history channel(something about Genghis Khan) and she knows I hate it, but doesn't care. She is not even really watching it. Oh well. 

Almost everyone is in Georgia on the band trip and I miss them. I want to hang out with them but I am going to see them all on tuesday and they will be so wiped from the trip ('cause they didn't get any sleep and I know it). I have to finish writing a paper before then too. Grrr... I hate history!!. 

Tomorrow is chaos, and I know it. I have to sell bread and tickets, and clean up after the coffee social. I hate it. The Jr. ACRY can just go right down the toilet for all I care. 

I need to go set the table and I am so not in the mood to get yelled at some more. 

How 'bout I just not give a poo for the next couple months, maybe that will make me feel better.
