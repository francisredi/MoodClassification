RANT: Sodding London Transport!
Kitty and I went to the newsagent this morning to get her bus pass for the week and found that she needs a new 16/17 Oyster Photocard thingy just to be able to buy it!

Never were we told about this, otherwise I'm sure she would have applied for it in advance. It was advertised that 7-day and longer period TRAVELCARDS needed to be on Oyster now, but nothing else. Grr! 

London Transport need toget their damn priorities right, stop giving children free travel while making transport prohibitively expensive and complicated for everyone else! It would've cost us &#163;6 just for one day's travel into college between us. It's bad enough that I now have to pay &#163;11 a week for a bus pass alone. I HAVE NO INCOME! I AM A COLLEGE STUDENT! HELLO?!

If you want to encourage people to use public transport, this isn't the way to go about it!

Oh, and don't get me started on sodding bendy-busses. HATE HATE HATE HATE!

Pardon my language.
