I'm not a violent person...
but that woman gets on my nerves.  After what she did to her, to my friend, one of my best friends........that woman is lucky it hasn't been me she had to deal with, I would not have been this nice, this diplomatic, this quiet this long.  I would have gotten in her face weeks ago.  Heck, I would have told her where she could go and what she could do weeks ago and left her high and dry.  To evoke tears from my friend, that's a nearly impossible thing to do, seriously, getting my friend to cry is like trying to get a hummingbird to be still, right, it's basically impossible.  That woman.....I'm trying so hard to be a Christian right now and not say and do everything that my evil human nature wants to.  Right now it's hard for me to even think that I'm supposed to love that woman.  I definitely do not like her right now.  I would say I hate her if it weren't for the fact that hate is wrong, but I really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY dislike her.  It's too bad that I don't have clout in certain circles - any of it I had would be spent bringing the woman to the very bottom of the totem pole and telling the world in those circles how horrible she is so that no one else has to suffer what my friend did.

I'm angry, can ya tell?
