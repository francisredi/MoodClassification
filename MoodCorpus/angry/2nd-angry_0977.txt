FUCKING KILL JESSICA SEARING!!!
I FUCKING HATE THE DAMN BITCH! SHE FUCKING DENIED ME THE SOUND OF MUSIC!!!! I FUCKING love THE SOUND OF MUSIC!!!!!!!!!!
&nbsp;
But, nooooooooooooo, I have to go outside the door and just HEAR it!!! THATS EVEN FUCKING WORSE!!!!!!!!! I was actually crying. I know, I'm pathetic, but I love the damn movie. Besides that, I had a pretty good day.
&nbsp;
History: First: Not bad, not good. As the French would say, "Bof!"
Science: Second: SO much fun!! We did the measuring volume lab by dropping stuff in water. I played with the water at the end. Got soaked. Cold out.
French: Third: Usual hellhole.
English: Fourth: see above (aka the Mrs. Searing rant)
Algebra: 5th: FUN!!! We like did no notes today and I understood half the crap.
Adv Tech: 6th: SUB TODAY!!!! SOOOOO MUCH FUN!
And then I left after 6th to go to counseling which went, surprisingly well.
We talked about Keith (my ex-step-dad) moslty but I wanted to talk about how much I hate Mrs. Searing and I actually got about a minute to talk to her where I screamed, I HATE HER!!!!! And the counselor laughed.
&nbsp;
Then she asked "So whats this hardrock tile and marble?" (i was wearing a sweatshirt that said that) and i said "Oh, its my dads, all my other sweatshirts arent sweet", but I meant to say "All my other sweatshirts arent clean" so we both bust up. lol

yeahhh that was my day...
