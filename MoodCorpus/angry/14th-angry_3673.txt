Damnit man!
This is just getting ridiculous already. I really hate MY SPACE. Yes I said it. I HATE MY SPACE. It's like crack. Everyone I know has one and they are all addicted. They run to a computer every chance they get to check their profile and it's pretty pathetic. Seriously, how many people actually have that many friends? Yes everyone on MY SPACE has like 100 friends or more, but how many of them are actually their friend? If you were that close, why aren't you hanging out with them instead of chatting online? I just don't see how these people have so many friends if all they do is spend their time on MY SPACE. I really want to know. Who are they trying to impress? It's not some popularity contest, so stop trying to get random friends just to have them on your profile. If for whatever reason you actually have that many friends and all of you are always online talking to one another, then maybe you guys should get off your butts and go outside. The sun will do you all some good...It is embarrassing to know that so many people are hooked on MY SPACE. Don't get me wrong, I think that it is a great creation and it is good for people who moved away and are trying to keep in touch. I just hate what it is doing to people. It is like technological crack to them.
