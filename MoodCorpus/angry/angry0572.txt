the completely seperate and less emo note...
right then, enough of that bullshit... why do (some) girls say "boys suck" all the time?  am i not the only one that gets insanely pissed off by that?  if you hate boys so much, go become a lesbian.  not that there is anything wrong with lesbians, but they REALLY don't boys.  also, if your dating "boys" your a dirty pedophile.  i don't date girls, i date women, ladies, or (as MY MOM so apty put it) chicks.  right, back on topic.  to say you hate boys is a bullshit statement.  you obviously don't hate all boys if one pisses you off.  OR, if you really do hate all boys when one pisses you off, then i am perpetually pissed off at you, because somewhere in this world, at every second of the day, there is a woman somewhere doing something that is undoubtly pissing me off.  granted most of these incidents take place in the governer building of new york, but thats not the point.  actually, by now, i'm sure you see my point.  and if you don't... i don't know, hate men all you want i suppose...
