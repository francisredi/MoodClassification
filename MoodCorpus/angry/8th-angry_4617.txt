Well, isn't this a happy entry!?
I am in the worst mood possible.

I hate my cat. He's destroying our house. We have had shut all the doors in every room because he's in there drinking out of the toilet, unraveling the toilet paper, knocking things off the shelves, scattering my earrings from one end of the house to the other, stealing my makeup brushes, knocking our cell phones in the garbage disposal, etc, etc, etc. His new favorite game is jumping up to hang on the blinds. He runs across our couches and I know it's only a matter of time before he rips a hole in one or both of them with his back claws. He's already ripped a hole in Derek's leather jacket. I fucking hate him and I know I won't be able to find a good home for him. The market's saturated as it is, and my only choice other than dealing with his bullshit is taking him to a shelter, which I really don't want to do because I know they'll kill him. As much as I hate him, I don't want him dead.

I cannot stand my sister. She's a little bitch and I want her out of my wedding.

I am beginning to feel pretty useless at my job. They only want me to run copies or fix their stupid errors in Excel. They are all doing an excellent job of making me feel like the uneducated peon that I know I am.

I hate school this semester. I feel like I'll never be done with school.

I am sick and tired of being sick and tired.

It's fucking snowing and I fucking hate snow.

Okay, I think that'll do it for now.
