Angry, Part 2
I'm also angry at myself for other things.  Oh yes, fear not!  Part 1 was only the beginning!

I'm angry for believing I could truly connect through this Internet to any stranger.  I'm angry for aligning myself with others who spew constant negativity.  I'm angry for choosing to crush on those whom I have actually very little in common with.  I'm angry for choosing this venue for romanticism and pleasure for so long.

Most ridiculous.

I got a call out of the blue from  (Adam) today around lunchtime.  I know Adam from real life.  He knows me.  We had a wonderful discussion about our relationship - a friendship I dropped years back.  There were old wounds I had to apologize for, and I readily did, because I have a special love for that human being.  He is amazing.  And I get that I will never ever be able to have and hold any sort of true connection or solid friendship with some people who don't even know me in real life nor care to know the whole me.  It just isn't going to happen.  Not because I'm not willing, but because they're not willing, for whatever reason.

So, if I back away from you and you actually give a crap, let me know.  If I back away from you and you don't even care, then, well, I know where we stand.  Thanks for the laughs and good times, and we can have that still.  But as far as getting to know you as a person, I've tried.  And it's not worth it to me to get zilch in return.  I have absolutely no idea who you are, and the little I am shown is not enough for me to base any sort of real friendship on.  I can't change that.  I've tried to be an open book, but when my book keeps getting slammed shut I need to get the hint and start building distance rather than clinging to the hope of being held by you as a real friend.

I'm angry at myself for believing there could be more.
