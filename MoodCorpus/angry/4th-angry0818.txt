Bah hum bug and another fucking year...
I hate being so sucky about christmas and new year and the whole period. I hate begrudging people all the public holidays and good times and fun and all that shite. But I find it so much harder to cope over the new year period. 

For several weeks it has been nearly impossible to get to my favourite coffee shop. The christmas shopping and all that jazz. And now for the last couple of days it has been closed all together. There are plenty of coffee shops but at that coffee shop they know my name. They know what I want to order. They know how I like it. They know that even when I say I want to eat in that I want my coffee in a take away cup. They know that I like the black straws and not the red ones. They know that I do not want sprinkles or other such crap destroying my coffee experience. They know where I like to sit. I feel comfortable and welcome there. But more than that it's part of my routine and how I like to relax. I feel so agitated when it get's all messed up and I hate feeling this way over something which I know should be petty and small, but it's just, well, not. I just can't wait for all this new years crap to be over so I can go back to the way things are normally. To feel comfortable and at ease again.
