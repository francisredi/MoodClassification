Single's Awareness Day
Well, it's time again for the next rant on Valentine's Day.  Doesn't it suck how flowers and candy and romantic dinners are being flaunted all around when you're single?  I feel that it does.  It feels like a gouge in the eye with a sharp stick.  I am torn between the urge to cry that I don't have someone to be romantic with, or the urge to cry because of the commercialism of it all.  Don't get me wrong, giving out those silly little valentine's cards that kids give out is all fun and good, but looking at dozens of roses, when I haven't even gotten ONE from a guy hurts a little.  I'm such a freaking dicotomy.  Do I hate Valentine's Day in principle, or do I hate it because I'm alone.  Either way, I still hate it.  What are my plans for the day I have henceforth declared Single's Awareness Day, you ask?  Studying Latin, reading the Aeneid, most likely watching Nick at Nite, and dorfing around on the internet.  Not to mention cleaning the house.  Woo.  Aren't I exciting.

Did you notice that Single's Awareness Day could also be just plain S.A.D.  Go me.  by the way, I have therepy tomorrow, that's a definate plus...
