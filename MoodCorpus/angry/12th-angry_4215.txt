On Religion.
Have I ever mentioned how much I hate religion? Especially organized religion, especially religions that condemn and exclude minorities? Religions that encourage hatred and bias as something righteous and dignified? As the right thing to believe because your God has deemed it thus? Have I ever vented on how I feel that religion is destroying everything we hold dear about humanity? About society? How religion is doing nothing to bring us all together, to unite us. Religion is only segregating us and shredding us apart, incubating hate and prejudice.

[b]Jenner:[/b] not gonna happen
[b]Jenner:[/b] they're bible bias*
[b]Eric:[/b] I know, it just really hurts
[b]Eric:[/b] b/c his family's so nice and they welcomed me and all his brothers and sisters know me, etc.
[b]Jenner:[/b] that's what sucks about religion
[b]Jenner:[/b] that's what really makes me hate it
[b]Jenner:[/b] it's supposed to bring families (and people) together.
[b]Jenner:[/b] but, all it does is tear them apart.
