Fuck Food
Food and I have a love-hate relationship.&nbsp; When I'm depressed, all I do is eat and eat and eat and when I'm mad, I don't want to have anything to do with it.&nbsp; It's almost as if the food did something to me and I'm going to punish it.&nbsp; I don't know what it is, but I haven't eaten anything for the last nine hours and I don't feel like eating, either.&nbsp; I think another part of it is the person that I'm mad at is myself and it makes me feel better to think that I'm suffering.&nbsp; That's a little sick, but whatever.&nbsp; I think somehow I think that if I'm miserable I'll think twice about being me tomorrow.&nbsp; (As if I can help it.)&nbsp; Still, it seems that I go just a little bit longer without food or something else to make me miserable then I'll learn my lesson and be a better person tomorrow: less selfish, more compassionate, less sensitive, more patient, less upset, more in control of my own emotions.&nbsp; Less 'me.'&nbsp; If I weren't me, I'd hate me and sometimes I hate me even though I'm me.&nbsp; Does that make any sense?&nbsp; Whatever.&nbsp; So what if it doesn't?&nbsp; I understand it and I'm just selfish enough to not give a rat's ass if it doesn't to anyone else.&nbsp; Isn't that horrible?&nbsp; And I wonder why I end up not eating.&nbsp; Well, the good news is I've lost a lot of weight this way.&nbsp; That's always something, right?&nbsp; It almost makes me mad that something good is coming of all this.&nbsp; The entire underlying purpose was to make myself miserable, not reward&nbsp; myself for my bad behavior with a smaller dress size.&nbsp; Sometimes you just can't lose.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- &nbsp; And that is just plain annoying.&nbsp; I don't know what's wrong with me these days, but I've disliked myself more than usual.&nbsp; Part of me wonders if it's the Zoloft.&nbsp; It's been known to increase depression in a lot of people.&nbsp; I don't know; maybe I'm just being paranoid.&nbsp; Lord knows it wouldn't be the first time.&nbsp; That's how I end up in boats like this: my freakin' paranoia.&nbsp; If I could just calm down and take a breath then I could maybe learn to deal.&nbsp; Whatever, it's not like that'll ever happen.&nbsp; I better eat a little something now because the computer screen is moving and Laura's had to pick me up off the floor lots of times in the last week and I don't want her to have to do it again, but - just for the record -&nbsp;I don't want to.
