Stupid cars! I OFFICIALLY HATE people who dont know how to drive. Id say people who drive in general, but Tryna drives, and I dont hate her. Not now anyway lol jk jk. But yeah! Dont you EVER try to cut off a bus. I was on my way to work, and Im sitting there, all content and happy, looking at the ads, listening to Hedley's "Trip", and the next thing I know Im turning and my whole body is being pushed into my left forearm to prevent me from going into the metal bar on the seat ahead, and then its all over, FAST. Im like "wtf", completely outraged because having hurting arms and being a cashier doesnt work together. I look over out the window and theres this car like, RIGHT THERE. The bus driver is on the phone, and then he turns around and is like "Hi" and tells us stuff that I dont remember, I was still in shock. He says to just cross the street and a 7 will be along soon. So I go to that stop and Im like "Awesome. Im going to be late. Fuck fuck fuck." I HATE being late. Makes me wanna cry for some reason. Heres the thing though: NOW I have pain. NOW my chest hurts, i have a huge headache, and i feel a little ill. The driver didnt give us any forms to fill out or anything! Needless to say, I think Im going to be a little angry at the transit system for a while, and I am NEVER sitting in those seats that go sideways ever again, although if I were sitting in a regular seat I wouldve smacked my head off the metal part in front of me. Still though. Just.. Still. Fuck! I hurt. I need a hug. I didnt even want to work today, let alone the shift I ended up working (I ended up leaving 20 minutes after 6 too, which counts as evening, which I specifically said NO EVENINGS!!). Ugh. Id better sleep tonight. If I dont then Im screwed for Monday. Goddamnit!
