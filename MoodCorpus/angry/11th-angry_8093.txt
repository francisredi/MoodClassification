i hate sharing a room with my sister.

hate hate hate hate hate hate hate it.  because it's 6am, i have no business being awake aside from a bathroom run or an occasional wake-up-in-the-middle-of-the-night thing that leaves me awake for five minutes tops.  but around this time of day in my house, this is normal because at 4:45am amandas stupid fucking radio comes on, tuned to country music, at the precise volume that it becomes impossible to sleep through.  

it's SO LOUD!

i mean, at least when i leave my music on, i have it so that even i can barely hear it.  and if amanda wants it off, she asks or turns it off herself and i really don't mind.  but if i were to walk across the room and turn it down myself, she'd wake up out of her slumber and yell at me.  and thats the only time she's awake through it..

AAAAAGGGGGHH STUPID FUCKING HICK MUSIC!  

must.. resist.. urge.. to kill...

(seriously i don't get pissed off at all unless i am obstructed from eating or sleeping.  then it gets ugly.  but these are basic human needs.. i think it's not entirely unreasonable.)
