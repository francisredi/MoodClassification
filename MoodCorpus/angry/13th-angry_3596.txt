Death Of A Hated Choir Teacher March 15, 2006, the worst choir teacher in the world was destroyed. After enraging a 14-year old female student, *Brenda Dayton*, was brutifully and unmercifully murdered. Sarah, the enraged student, hit Mrs. Dayton in the head with an amp before dragging her into the school's shop room, where she placed Mrs. Dayton's head in a clamp, and proceeded to drill holes into it until she was dead. Sarah then used the table saw to cut Mrs. Dayton into pieces small enough to fit into the tuba case conveniontly located in the music room right by both the choir and shop rooms. She would have gotten away with it too. If it weren't for those 4 pesky kids and their stupid fucking dog, too!!! Okay so one of my friends got mad at me today because I said something about her being chubby... I don't even remember, but let's pretend I called her a fatty-patty. Anyway, I apologized, but she kept pretending to be mad at me. So I followed her into the bathroom and sat on her. She screwed up my hair, and it looked like we just had wild animal sex or something... lol I'm not a bisexual... Don't get the wrong idea. Anyway we walked back into the classroom fixing our hair, and straightennig our clothes when Mrs. Dayton (not really her name, but oh well) gave us a really weird look. I said "I was raped" and everyone busted up laughing except Dayton. She freaked out and said "Don't ever say that... even if you are just joking" Okay.... It's just an expression!!! Holy Fuck! She pissed me off so bad. I only wish I could've killed her. Moral Of This Entry: Raping is not funny; It's halrious.
