Oh, the dreams. 


The Dr. Seuss one - finding they had added to, 'The Grinch', using his original drawings..with a new character that looked just like my father. Ironic, as it was his favorite. Vivid, detailed black and white ink sketches.

The church one. Just horrible. Sitting there at picnic tables in the church; on insistant invitation from Teh Man, as he sat in front of us - oh, so pure and pious - with this woman - the same one I dreamed of him with before; the slatternly, eyebrowless bleached blonde a la Jerry Springer - and EVERYONE (including small children) staring and 'tsk'-ing and then coming up to me and talking so lovingly, so admiringly of him - all KNOWING his history - saying stuff like, 'He's a pill junkie and a drunk (this little Amish girl)', etc and acting like they hate me, like I am the one in the wrong, shame on me, etc. and finally leaving. End up in this hotel, with my daughter - where he shows up and I quick run into the shower to avoid him, but he comes in, anyway, and I freak OUT on him - so angry - screaming and hitting him. So angry. I have this list of grievances SO long, SO many things he doesn't even remember doing..and I just woke up, just now.

Jeez.
