I'm tired and easily irritable. I went driving again today and it is so stressful. I hate it. My mom and I were going to Sam's, and I asked her if I could turn, to double check, because I have these fears that I'm forgetting the rules of driving, and she just didn't answer me. Then all of a sudden she was yelling at me to go, and it just freaked me out and made me mad.
Leaving the Sam's parking lot, this guy was standing with some sign asking for something--who knows what--and intentionally blocking the stop sign. Now, if I was used to driving there, I would have known there was a stop sign there. but I didn't. So I was turning out and my mom yelled that there was a stop sign and I looked and sure enough, it was there...behind me. Then I almost got hit because when she raised her voice I slowed down. and then I just started crying for no apparent reason other than the fact that I was scared. And when my mom yells at me, I know she's not yelling because she's mad, she just wants to make sure I hear her. but it still fries my nerves.


I HATE DRIVING!!


When we got home I had to do that **** english crap. which I hate. and it took a while. and it was boring and stupid and all my answers sucked because I didn't feel like doing anything.

And now I am ready to punch Eric in the face. He knows I'm in a bad mood but he continues to be annoying, then wonders why I yell at him. I think I will go explode.
