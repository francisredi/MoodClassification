So Mike and I are off to the big Apple in less than an hour.&nbsp; For some reason this morning I was the most tired I've been in literally 10 years, ever since my caffeine pills incident and I ended up sleeping for 27 hours straight.&nbsp;I was so physically tired that I went to say goodbye to the prairie dogs in their cage and got so dizzy just from looking downward that I fell on the floor. My top eyelids feel like heavy&nbsp;little bricks that constantly want to slide down over my eyes. I've already wiped my left contact out of my eye twice from yawning and rubbing my eyes. I can't wait till I get on the plane/get in the car so I can close them and relax a little.&nbsp;I've gotten to the point where I sleep so horribly every night that I have to wear an eye mask to block out&nbsp;any tiny ray of light, AND wear earplugs to&nbsp;deafen any noise that might be heard during the night. Still, after all this precaution I still happen to wake up between 5 to 10&nbsp;times, for 15 minute intervals every single night. I went to the doctor a few days ago and someone remarked that I look exhausted, cold and pregnant. I guess that is my cue to fucking join a gym and get some rest.&nbsp; Damn. Who says that to someone anyway???So out of the few things I've learned today, Mike's company account he works on has just filed for bankruptcy&nbsp; Dana Corp.&nbsp; I think he'll be happy if they drop their contract with us because Dana is a pain in the ass... I know I would be happy if Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada blew up during my vacation and I no longer had to listen to Celine Dion songs while on hold or try to decipher French slang on all my faxes like "livre", which accourding to freetranslation.com means "book",&nbsp; but really means "shipped" according to the annoyingly hard to understand French man I asked. Ah God I want to cry just thinking about coming back to this hell. I hate it I hate it I hate it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I FUCKING HATE YOU STUPID P&amp;W... EVEN THOUGH YOU PROBABLY MADE THE ENGINE OF THE PLANE I WILL BE FLYING IN. IF THE PEOPLE I HAVE SPOKE WITH AT P&amp;W IS ANY INDICATION OF THE INTELLIGENCE OF YOUR ENGINEERS, I HAVE NO HOPE IN SURVIVING MY TRIP. At least I'll finally get some sleep......See you&nbsp; "semaine prochaine" as the french would say.
