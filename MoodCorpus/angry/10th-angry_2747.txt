I hate Valentines Day. I hate it when I have a boyfriend and I hate it when I dont. I miss when valentines day was a day where u get a buncha cardboard cards from your class, with your favorite animal, or movie on it. 
So heres my terrible day. A couple of days ago zack told me he got my valentines day present. So I get to school and he doenst have anything for me, or say anything at all. And when I asked him if he wanted his present he said no i dont wanna carry it around all day. And when I asked if I was getting anything he said yeah but i didnt feel like bringing it to school. So i got like really mad. I kinda overreacted I know i did. And i wrote him a kinda mean note. But then I saw him after 3rd and he was like are u still mad at me, and i lied and said no and he goes look i dont want you to be mad at me so i'll just tell you, I didnt bring your present to school because I was going to give it to you later, I had a surprise all planned out for you. sheesh then I felt really bad. So then he was like there is no point in doing the surprise anymore cause u know there is one. So now i dont know if theres a surprise or not. But its 8:09 and he gets done baseball at 8 so i guess theres still a chance?? I dunno. I feel really bad.
Anyways the end.
