Life and its problems!!
I just returned from my so called exam(11:30pm)...which turned out to be hell. I hate my college system....teachers screw students and students screw other students...running into a vicious world of selfishness and lack of sympathy. 
students were suffering to keep up with the time and I was one of them. I had barely 10 mins and I havenot started on my open-ended yet. some students were randomly guessing because of the time constraint. our exam especially organic is given in 3 different campuses because of 3 different professors. there are 4 different versions of the exams(same questions, diff.order). some of my friends took it at different campuses and most people came out with blank faces. What gets me mad is the fact that last years exam was very simple compared to ours. the lacked 1 chapt too. 
I am so angry that I have no words coming out at the moment to describe my horrible feeling...

I HATE HATE HATE PROFESSORS WHO WANT TO BE A**HOLES...sorry about my language...
