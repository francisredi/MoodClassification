I hate work!!!
So, I hate my job! I hate everything about it! The management is having a mandatory staff meeting tonight at Spring Creek BBQ. I don't want to go! It is going to be one GIANT bitch fest! Blah. And I am upset that I didn't get to go to Motion City last night... How was it guys? I had to go pick up my grandmother from work. Not nearly as much fun. Then I went to Jacob's to work on planning Cody's party. It is going to be a lot of work, but it will pay off at the party. It is going to be kickass! You guys had better do it up big!

I just feel like work is overwhelming. I can't do anything the week of spring break cause they have totally fucked my shedule up! 

It was my manager... that bitch ain't right.

Yeah, I am still checking on whether I can go to Dwight's lake house this weekend. I hope so, I am ready for a much needed break. 

Well, I am not supposed to be on the computer at work. So I'd better go before they do something else shitty like decrease my pay or something. I hope everyone is having a better day than I am. See you guys later!

Shit! I left my cellphone at home. :(
