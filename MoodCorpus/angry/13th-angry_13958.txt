I'm so fucking sick of everything.
I'm sick of everything. I quit. I'm done. I'm tired of people's bullshit. My friends are fucking backstabbers that can be the nicest people one minute, but then the next they can evil mean bitches. I hate it. I dont even want to go to school anymore becuase of it. This is the reason I actually like going to work--- I get paid to stand at a register and puch buttons for 3 hours every other day. A lot of people despise it--- But those three hours give me sanity. I get away form everything that ever stresses me out in life- for three hours. No parents, no being at home, no school bullshit, no homework, no anything. I dont see my friends, so they dont piss me off, and they can't call me at work. I get left alone for three hours. Sure, I occasionally talk to some people that work there, but I barely know them, so they don't annoy me. And my boss doesnt annoy me either(because I'm nice to him)so unlike the other people there who he tells to do stuff, he asks me to do it. Becuase I'm such a nice person. hah.

Today sucked. My friend called me a bitch today. And she was totally serious about it(you kind of had to be there to have it actually bother you). And shes my "best" friend too. Because I apparently dont care about anything. This is another reason I like guys SOOOOO much better than girls. They don't have drama. I would kill to have at least 5 really good guy friends. I dont even care if I get called a slut by people. I would be happy. I would have 5 people who dont piss me off. But anyway-- back to being called a bitch. So apparently , I dont care about anything, But this is coming from the friend who always calls me, then decides to go watch TV, so whenever I say something to her, she makes me repeat it becuase she wasnt paying attention. This happens like every other day-- I cant fucking take it anymore.

I'm contemplating on weather or not to carve a giant x on my arm--- just to vent some anger.
