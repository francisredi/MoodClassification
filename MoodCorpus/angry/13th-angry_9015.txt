Silent screams
I feel like I want to just yell at the top of my lungs. I don't even know what, or at what, but everything is just so frustrating right now, so fucking screwed up that I don't know what to do and everything I seem to try just makes the snowball go faster. Maybe I'm not trying enough, maybe I'm not trying anything, I really don't know. But the fact of the matter is I don't know anything more than you do about us, about our relationship, whatever it may be, or about how to fix it.

Why are my words in this electronic, boldfaced forum somehow so much more meaningful than my words over the phone? Why do these words somehow have so much greater permanance that those which I utter? Something to think about I guess.

I'm really just angry right now. Purely and completely angry. And I can't afford to be. I've got too much work ahead of me to be angry about everything right now, because when I'm angry, my mind just gets cloudy and I can't get anything done. I need to stop it.

I have to go to class now. Yippee for another great freakin' day.

(Yeah, I'm mad.)
