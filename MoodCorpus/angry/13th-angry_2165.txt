venting
Yeah, so I've just finished pacing around my room for a bit.&nbsp; It wasn't even an incredibly impressive pace either do to all the obstacles I have scattered on the floor from my earlier compulsion to combine scrapbooking and mosaics this evening.&nbsp; This however is a different topic, I digress too often.... Anyways, I think I have that Restless Legs Syndrome, or atleast all of my symptoms seem to suggest so.&nbsp; It's extremely irritating, and keeps me up at night.&nbsp; I lie in bed but my legs are so uncomfortable that I keep moving them, tossing and turning, and can't get to sleep.&nbsp; That's the point where my mind says "I'm not falling asleep anytime soon, I might as well make use of this time to think!"&nbsp; So now on top of the restless legs, I've got a resless mind.&nbsp; It is especially a restless mind that can't stop thinking about the restless legs, at which point I wonder if my restless mind is keeping my restless legs restless because it's thinking about them.&nbsp; Vicious cycle?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Restless cycle?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp;&nbsp; If all this reslessness wasn't enough, it seems that when my legs want to torture me,&nbsp;my feet want to get in on the action.&nbsp;&nbsp;When my legs bother,&nbsp;my feet are colder than normal (and that's very cold).&nbsp;&nbsp;There should be no reason for them to be so cold that when they&nbsp;touch my legs I want to throw up.&nbsp; I hate being cold.&nbsp; I hate when my feet are cold.&nbsp; I hate whining as much as I am now.&nbsp; So new tactic tonight!&nbsp; I'm going to walk a&nbsp;little bit more (since my first attempt at sleep was unsuccessfull), and do the&nbsp;unthinkable- sleep with socks on.&nbsp;(Ok, maybe not completely unthinkable because I&nbsp;sleep with socks on if I'm camping.&nbsp; But right now I have a heated water bed- a no socks zone).&nbsp; &nbsp;I hate sleeping with socks on, almost as much as I hate having cold feet (so this may be a lose-lose situation).&nbsp; Ok,&nbsp;I'm going to attempt this again... right after a walk around the house for a few more minutes.....&nbsp;hahah this is so pathetic, and a little bit amusing at the same time......&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but I HATE SLEEPING WITH SOCKS ON!!!!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ahh that feels a little better :}
