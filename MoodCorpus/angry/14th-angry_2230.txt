Why yes, I did get my period today.
I finally caved in and got a myspace. I had been holding out for years, because it's very similar to Friendster, which I hated.

And pretty much as I expected, myspace makes me loathe humanity. There's all these people I know on it, from high school and the Vancouver punk/indie scene and stuff, and I hate them all. I hate that myspace serves no other purpose other than being social, because I hate being social. Livejournal/blogging takes a higher level of intellectual commitment - at least the way I and most of my friendslist does it. We talk about ourselves and our lives, squee, laugh, complain, share thoughts, we write, we get to know one another. We all write on a semi-regular basis. We share interests and ideas. Myspace is too much of a reflection of the real-life social world. Name-dropping and friend creds. It is fucking depressing.

For lunch, I am eating palak paneer - spinach with paneer, a mild, curd-like cheese. Also, I am sulking. Fucking hormones.

I am adding "spending time alone" and "being a hermit" to my interests.
