I didnt go to school today. I was too depressed.I have so much on my mind right now.I hate it.I need to know you're okay.If I hadnt screwed everything up this wouldnt of happened.If I had just seen you for a bit and given you a hug.You wouldnt of done it. I could of helped you.But everything got messed up because I forgot my bus pass.The stupidest thing ever changed so much.And you, Ive been worried about you for so long.You and her are going to get through this,But still. I dont know if you're strong enough for this.&nbsp;You are a really strong person. But she is your world.Just remember that it is going to help in the long run.(Im also really afraid about how you might get kicked out or get in alot of trouble.Parents dont understand. They never really will.)And you, you have been working way too hard.Its starting to take its toll on your body.As soon as I see you Im going to give you a really long massage.You need to sleep. Are you working so hard because you want to?Or do you just want to get your mind off things?Alot has happened to you.But it doesnt nessicarily have to drag you down to the extent it is.And I honestly dont know what to do about you.I hate you so much. You hurt me so much last night.It was low. And the thing is, I dont want to talk about it to anyone.I hate all this crap that you've been pulling.&nbsp;You arent helping anything. You are just making me feel so much worse.And you say you dont have any trust in me?!Screw you.
