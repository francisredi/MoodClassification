I hate drama I hate getting into fights but I won't just forgive in forget im not going to be a person's bitch if someone fucks with me or messes with me ill fuck you up no im not that mean but I hate inorrant, immature, rude people. Before I would hide me feelings and let people boss me around tell me what to do ive changed sooooo much 
Ill be a bitch to you if I don't like you
and Im honest so im not goind to say shit behind peoples backs because I have the balls unlike some people to say things to peoples faces.
I have finals and im soooooooooo stress out and to add onto to that I have drama and people who yell at me and a teacher who doesn't let me speak what's on my mind and just tells me im good cause she wants my money but that's another story.
Im venting to myself so w/e im werid Im a bitch be fucking deal issant everyone.
