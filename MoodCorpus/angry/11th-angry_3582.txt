Because it's raining and I am in a foul mood thinking about the mail getting wet,AGAIN!
You Are 62% Evil
You are very evil. And you're too evil to care.
Those who love you probably also fear you. A lot.How Evil Are You?

One of these days I will figure out how to redo the mailbox and the mail will no longer get wet, or, when I decide to relocate to Mama's, I will have it all forwarded to the other address and figure screw the stupid substitute mail carrier who keeps messing with the box every time I fix it so that it will stay closed with a slam.  I have a new mail box and a new drill with which to put it up, but still haven't figured out the bracing it needs to not have the same problem i.e. it wiggles and rocks and the neighborhood brats keep knocking out the supports, or maybe it is the mail carrier.  I am not sure.  *sigh*  It is just s nasty rainy day and I don't want to take my arthritic very sore knee out in the rain just to go 500 feet up the road to get the damned mail! Thus I am evil today. GRRR!
