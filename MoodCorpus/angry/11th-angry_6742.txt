Anger...
So, I'm a sweet person, I'm neither a leader nor a follower. I've always been tag in the middle, you could say THE lady behind the man, the one that whispers but don't stand up. 

Right now, I'm so pissed off, I got all of those schemes in my head to get payback.&nbsp; I won't bore anyone with the reasons I'm so angry, but I'll get her back.&nbsp; If I paiged her the right way, I know she'll come back to get me.&nbsp; I'm so ready.&nbsp; Five years of learning streetfighting combat and a life living with a wanna be actress... I'm ready.&nbsp; But somehow, what piss me off the most, is that I know she's crawling and shacking and she's just gonna run to avoid the fight.&nbsp; I wanted that fight, I needed it.

In between, I'm going to make her shake like she has no idea.&nbsp; She will have to come to me... or run away.

Sorry to all that weren't concerned about this...

I got to say to readers of my stories.... chapter 3 of It Doesn't Matter is almost complete as Triangle new chapter.
