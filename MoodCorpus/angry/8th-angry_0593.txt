Bitch
I am about to go crazy! I hate this year. I hate how everyone is changing. I can't even count on my friends. I am not holding a grudge, its just not ever going to be the same. No matter what we do. It will never be how it used to be. I feel so out numbered and ganged up on with both of you, even though i know you guys arent trying to. Maybe im just being sensitive, but i dont care, im not take this shit anymore. Fuck you if you dont like my prom dress, maybe i didnt like yours last year either, but whats the point in hurting somones feelings when you know it cant be changed. Im not taking the dress back, so why say you dont like it when i HAVE to wear it anyway. Fuck you. and you're stupid boyfriend that hasnt even taken you on a date yet? atleast, i hope he has. I also dont care what you guys say about her. She is my friend and we will be spending a lot more time together. Treat me like shit again, I dare you. I hate you. Im done with trying, Im done with caring.
Im just done.
