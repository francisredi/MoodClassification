I think I avoided the computer and all related activities for the entire weekend. Hm.  

This means that I am probably hopelessly behind on my flist, but I shall make an effort.  It may take a day or two for me to catch up.

I hurt all over. And, I hate everything right now.  Everything.  Even things I normally like.  Perhaps this is part hurt, part sleep deprivation, and it's all mingling together with the after-effect of strange dreams and a strange evening.  For some reason, I'm angry at Nyte. I do not know why this is, but I am.  Uhm.  Unreasonable? Yes.  I vaguely remember waking up at 4:30 and he wasn't yet in bed, and that made me very sad and angry at the same time, but I think I was still half-asleep and so didn't go get him.  It's very fuzzy, but it still irritated me this morning, and I am still irritated. I at least managed not to nag at him about it this morning, as he was trying to sleep and was probably in the same half-asleep, non-functional state I was in last night.  

I figure that if it really is important, then I'll still be angry when he gets home, and can talk about it then. If I'm not angry at that point, then it apparently doesn't matter, and doesn't need to be discussed.  I have a growing suspicion that it is largely dream-related, which isn't anyone's fault and only needs to be dealt with on my own.  I have an even larger suspicion that I am teh crazy and trying to rationalize it away.

So. Just. Not a very good morning thus far.
