what to do
What to do when presented with someone who for any number of reasons is pissed off at the world, and wants or needs to blow up at you for any and all reasons...I want so bad to help but without taking on the anger (I do anyways) it is my nature to take on the rage, sorrow and all other emotions of those I love and care for... I got the scope of the emotional rage over the phone... I don't know how to handle it when it is presented to me face to face... I am in such a strange position, I want to see the future for the positives it holds but instead I can only see the negitive effects! I need to DO something, I can't stand sitting here twiddling my thumbs any more. I have ideas up the wazoo about a business I want and need to start but I am clueless about business plans, and I need to make one inorder to get the start up $$$ I want to do this so bad it is making me more depressed than the medical crap I am going through! ugh I hate my self so much right now I wish I were smarter! I wish I could measure up to the standards I set for my self... I don't want to be the dumb blonde any more, I just don't know where to start!!
