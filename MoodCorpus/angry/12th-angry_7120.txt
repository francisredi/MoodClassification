I am so down.  My baby is kicking my ass, literally, don't think i mentioned it yet, but he bruised my rib and still intends to keep his foot rested right on it, and he is lying on some nerve that is so inflamed in my right hip area.  It really hurts.  Not to mention my hormones have me on an emotional roller coaster right now, I almost cried at work today when a customer said something smart.  I think I'll cry the next time my hubby calls just cause.  My daughter is driving me nuts lately, I think sometimes I have just been loosing my patience to early and getting too upset right away.  But she sure knows how to push buttons.  I am not having any luck finding a place and it is really pissing me off.  I hate climbing up and down the stairs, I hate having to walk a fricken mile from the parking lot to the front door, I hate the carpet, I hate the loud people that just moved in a few apartments down, I hate the mail lady.  Err.  I can't seem to please my hubby lately.  Just not mailing enough and having enough to talk about without complaining all the time and crap like that.  I am just upset lately!!! And I have no one to talk to about anything with out them getting all judgemental or telling everyone else and their mommas, or give examples about how there life is the same or worse.  I just want someone to listen and fricken understand, and they don't have to give fricken advice, just listen and console me.  And my hubby is the only one that can do that, but I can't talk over the phone because I just want him to hold me.  Is that so much to ask!!
