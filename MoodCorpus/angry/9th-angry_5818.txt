Feelings
Honey and  came by tonight.  We watched Arrested Development on Fox, then the news came on.  They showed a picture of the guy that used the credit card.  It was the one that we suspected.  The only other person that had a  key to his place.  We had found the guy on the internet.  Saw his pictures.  We weren't sure, we are all confused.  Then the news showed HIS picture.  I don't think I've ever felt so much anger towards one person in my whole life.  And that's saying a lot seeing the bad people that I've known.  I really HATE this man, and all that he is, what he did to MY friend.  What he did to the friend of a lot of people.

His best friend came by the office this morning.  It broke hearts to hear her sobbing.  I know that there are other people that are way more hurt by his MURDER than I am, but I know that I hurt and I know that I'm angry and I know that I want this bastard caught and I want him to confess and then I want very illegal things done to him.  I want him to hurt way more than he hurt my friend.  He has A LOT of pain that he needs to pay for.

Goddamn fucking bastard.  It would be really nice for them to find him on the side of the road after a long torturous death with his eyes picked out by birds and signs of a long, painful death.  Or at least a very uncomfortable trial that he walks funny to EVERY day!

fuck! fuck! fuck!
