I can't do this. I'm sitting in the library. The girl sitting two seats away is smacking her gum, popping it, grinding it between her teeth as if it's a life form that will escape if she relents. The girl on my right is yelping commands at the boy worshiping her every move. The tap-tap-tap of the computer keys is like fingernails on a chalkboard to me. My stomach is in knots, the tears are welling up, and the nausea is setting in.
I have never been so repulsed by a group of people in my life. I'm shaking...it's killing me. I want out of this place. Right fucking now. I can't take it. I'm usually pretty deadpan when I'm alone and I don't talk to many people unless I'm with friends...but part of me wants to stand up and shout at every single person in this room. I want to tell them how pathetic and ugly they are. I want to tell the girl to quit popping her gum or I'm gonna kick her ugly, gum-smacking teeth in. I want to slap the boy for being such an idiot and I want to break the  girls fingers who hits the keyboard so hard. I've never wanted to kill an entire group of people before. A general malaise has turned into a firey hatred. I hate these people. 
I hate this town. I hate this lifestyle. This avalanche of emotion hit me so suddenly that I'm overwhelmed by it. I've never felt so much anger and hatred in my life. Thank God I love all of you.
