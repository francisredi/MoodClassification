Roommates
For two years in a row now I have had to live with people who upset me, in one way or another.  I am so tired of dealing with people, trying to find someone to live with, finding somewhere to live, showing other people the house that I was supposed to be in for the next three years (give or take), that I don't think I want to live with anyone next year.  Except maybe a dog.  Maybe even a cat - heh, another roommate that would ignore mw until she needed something from me, not a big change from now.

I hate people.  I hate how I am so easily swayed and when I try to be nice and do something that I think is the right thing to do, they take advantage of it.  I am so tired.  And really frustrated.  How am I supposed to be a good person when anyone that I do nice things for (who aren't already my friends) are such bitches to me after the fact?  I am so tired of living in a place where there is more than one person but I still feel like I am alone.

I hate roommates.  With the exception of Caitlin.

Super (fuck nice) Careo
