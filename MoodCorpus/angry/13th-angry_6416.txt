Erm...yes, it's another update :] obviously.

I think I have a problem. Why do people bother me so much? It's not like I HATE everyone I really don't, but alot of people annoy the crap out of me. Over half of the people in my school are arrogant, little pricks that claim They care about all of their friends, but they really don't. They decide to put on a pretty face and act as though they are content, but they're not. Urrr and those people that stop in the middle of the hall!!!!! I HATE that with all my being. They should have a seperate level in hell for those idiots. 2 weeks ago someone stopped in the middle of the stair case to talk to their little friend, I wanted to shove them down the flippin steps. and those people who carry around back packs that stick like out 1,00000 feet off their backs, I especially hate going up the stairs behind one of them, i get hit in the face with their ugly BAGS!!!!!!!! What could they possibly have in those things!!?? LITTLE PEOPLE????

Yeah...a little ranting, directed at no one. Anime detour = 6 days :D
