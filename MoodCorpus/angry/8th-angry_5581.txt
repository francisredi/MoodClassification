naivity (sp.) sucks
wow i haven't done anything on lj in a looooonnnng time. i think that people from the past all use xanga, all drama kids use lj, and everyone else uses facebook/myspace. and then a bunch of em use two or three. but anywhos. so i've been stuck on myspace for a while but i think i want to start posting journal entries again and it's kinda stupid to do that on myspace and i hate xanga. so enough rambling.

so right now the only think i can think of saying is that i hate being the innocent little naive no-nothing-about-anything girl. it sucks ass. i hate it. i don't know what marijuana smells like. i've never kissed a guy, let alone made out. i've never even had a boyfriend. i don't know how to get a hold of alcohol/drugs. i don't know most vocabulary that everyone else seems to know about street stuff. i've never been to a party with stuff like that, heck i've only ever really been to birthday partys. i've never seen porn. i know nothing about the goings-on with the government and therefore understand nothing on SNL and comedy central. i don't know anything about sports. i don't know the difference between a bloody mary and whiskey and gin and vodka, etc. i KNOW FUCKING NOTHING.

and it pisses me off. it really does. how did everyone else come to know a ton of stuff that seems to just be common knowledge, yet i somehow missed it all?i dont get it. it sucks.

kk that's my stupid post for now.
