Valentines Day......blech
I hate valentines day. I hate all the Lovey-doveyness that come with it, how a guy will act nice just cause it's valentines day and it's like some sort of obligation to get chocolate and cards. Uck! What am I doing for valentines day? Bringing a crapload of suckers to school, i'll give some to my friend and then pass them out during 5th hour so i'll get my extra credit. Heh, I ain't doing anymore; maybe a couple sarcastic "Happy Valentines Day"s thrown here and there but that's about it! And all the pink that goes with it, nasty. I swear that the color pink is hell spawn. It's nasty and prissy; and promotes the whole barbie image of perfection that so many of today's youth is striving for. It's sickening.
So I hate Valentines Day, so what?
And don't blame it on the fact that i've never had a boyfriend, cause that ain't it. I see no need to justify myself by throwing myself into a realationship that probably won't last a month. What use is that? I am quite proud to say that I am probably the only girl in my school that has never had a boyfriend. I see no point in having one. In fact I don't even have a crush on anyone in my school!! At any rate there are my feeling on valentines day. there will probably be another post tomorrow complaining about valentines day at school.
