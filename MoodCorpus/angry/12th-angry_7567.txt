sexilation
omgoodness i am so very angry at this moment, and this is nothing compared to the anger that i felt last night.  my roommate is inconsiderate to the extreme.  i was sexiled from 9pm-2am last night.  count them, that is five hours.  normally, whatever, i wouldnt have cared, howevever there were circumstances that should have been considered.  i am atually currently at work, because every thursday this semester I have worked at 8 am in the morning... a fact that she knows and hates so much, because she gets up with my alarm, haha for her.  the other factor was that i have an exam today that I needed more sleep than i got for it.  noting that she has this exam with me, and knows that i have, its not like she didnt know that i have it. i mean she texts me at 12:30, asking when i want to come back... considerate right, not... she was already with him for like 3.5 hours, and she was definitely not looking for an early answer.  how can she be so selfish.  not to mention the fact that not only were those circumstances needed to be taken into consideration, i also have a ton of things to do today for before spring break.  not that she would know that, and im not mad on that count, but the other two, i am.  thankgoodness shes leaving today right after our exam, and I have the room to myself til when i leave on friday.

funny thing, it was such a great day yesterday.  i had been sick since last wednesday, and i was actually feeling quite better. and it was just such a great day, i got done tons of stuff, and it was beautiful outside.  oh it was just great. 

then it was just not good. horrible. i am just still so so furious.
