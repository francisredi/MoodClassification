quick update, then maybe a worse one later
So yeah, I just got back from the Spanish club trip. It was awesome, but some things also made it unbearable at the same time. The whole time I was under this awkward tension with people right from the get go. Gah. I hate feeling bad about feeling bad about this trip, because it should have been one of the best times of my life. It only doubles up everything. I don't know what to say except that I hope this feelings goes away because I was barely holding it together(not like crying, but just being really really not a friendly person) today when we got off the bus at the high school. I don't know. Things happened that  shouldn't have, but they still happened. WHy did you do it? I know why I did it and yeah, I hate it, but I can't help it when you lead. And I hate feeling like the only one trying to get something accomplished. I hate being second best to my brother. I know I'll never hear about this again from you and I guess I'll be fine with it after some sleep. hopefully. so now I'm off to take a shower and hope this passes from me like it'll pass from you.
