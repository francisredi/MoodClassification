I'm afraid of Americans, I'm afraid of the world, I'm afraid I can't help it, I'm afraid I can't
I'm fucking sick and tired of being bullied and abused.  I'm going to fight back next time.  For too long, I have tried to be open-minded and understanding, but this is fucking bullshit now.  I'm starting to hate the friends I have, and their friends, and their friends.  It's just another group I thought I'd fit into that just didn't turn out well.  Some people don't even realize just how close they are to a serious ass-kicking by me.  Recently, in lunch, a few times, I have more or less eaten lunch and listened to music by myself, but a couple people have tried to include me into the group that, well, I guess I've been almost straying from at times.  To tell the truth, I do not enjoy the company of this group anymore, and I especially hate the shit they put me through.  I guess they just think I'm easy to fuck with.  I honestly have enjoyed being by myself recently, especially if the fuckheads in front of me are the last chances of social interactions.  Anyway, my  Goldfrapp CD shipped yesterday (six days before the release date: awesome) and my Android Lust CD was delivered today (nine days after the release date: not awesome).  It's a very good CD, and I am a proud owner of it.

At least tomorrow's Friday.  I've had enough of this shitty fucking week.  It's not so much the school part that's been pissing me off, it's just everyone that goes to school (though this also includes teachers AND ESPECIALLY SHITTY FUCKING GUIDANCE COUNSELORS (YOU KNOW WHO YOU FUCKING ARE)).  I'd rather spend time with my family than in school.  Yeah, you heard me.



But sometimes I wish I had more regret,
Chris
