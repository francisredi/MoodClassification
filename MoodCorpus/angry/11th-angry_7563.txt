Yeah, fuck off. I know I haven't updated in a significant ammount of time. Deal with it, 'kay? I'm just really pissed off at the world lately. No one updates their LJs anymore, so why should I?

In Holly news, basketball came and went. We placed first in the tournament thanks to me. ROFL I'm not trying to sound self-absorbed but the team falls apart without me. I score the majority if the points.

In Neopets news, I finally think I've found another guy to like. It's not even my fault either. He's so hot but like only I would find him hot since he's like the guy version (personality-wise) of me. If he looked like me I'd probably freak out 'cause he'd be girly. Whatever, leave me alone. :(

Ok in other Neo news I've been like really out of it and have no idea what to do with it. I'm like 'wth?' because it's so boring. I got the SuAP avatar and all everyone wants to talk to me about is it. I even hate that I'm such an avatar snob, I just HAVE to use SuAP now because I have it. xD MSPP will /always/ be my favourite but some guy I HATE got it too.

I've been in really bad moods lately even though I was like PMSing LAST week. xD This week I've just been like not necessarily bitchy, just sort of upset and lonely. I need to get off the computer a lot more. I've been reading though a lot offline, which is sorta good news.
