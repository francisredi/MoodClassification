Major ventage.
So life is good...for the most part...there may be a slight glitch...misunderstanding...OH hell, I can't take it anymore!! What do you do when there is just one person, who you are FORCED, yes forced to live with, who just gets majorly majorly majorly under your skin. Her voice, her pressence everything just annoys me. And I have to live with her everyday until May. And it is just getting to the point where I don't want to be in my own room anymore. Today I seriously thought about wishing the semester to be over. WHO DOES THAT?!?! I get mad at her and mad at myself for getting mad at her because she is not a bitch and then I get mad all over again. It is neverending. She is so messed up, emotionally and physically. If I were to honestly describe everything about her and that has happened to her, you would be reading this for days, that is at least if you had the patience to sit through it. I just don't understand how someone can actually be that f-ed up! But whatev---at least it ain't me ! (this is me not spending anymore time on the subject)
