world semi-crashing.  

1.  i highly dislike this dog-sitting thing.  maybe because the dog is 'broken.'  (ie fucked up in the head).  i dunno.  but it doesnt let me sleep, all it wants to do is jump on me, and it pees at the drop of a hat.  it makes me miss my silly little apartment (which i am visiting to take care of MY animals).  is this week over yet?

2.  work SUCKS.  it takes a lot to REALLY piss me off and make me wanna get out, but im pretty much there.  we have no staff (and by choice, not due to people quitting... which they are going to do if it keeps up like this).  the store is running me -- im not running the store.  i cant do my job, because im covering a station (to save money), let alone any of my extra projects to improve the store.  i didnt even have time today to call applicants for interviews to start to remedy the situation.  (my GM is anti-hiring cuz it costs money).  whatev.  my solution?  well, there is a GM spot open in joliet, and i am planning to apply for it.  so is clay.  we both hate our store right now.  i hate seeing him hate work, cuz he is my one friend there, and if he loses hope, how can i remain positive?

so lets see how far away joliet really is... *sigh*
