I absolutely hate it when you start conversations with me and get off the computer and leave it at me waiting for a response. that is why i dont want to talk anymore. because there is always something unresolved with our conversation when you have to go back to your paradise. And it is like i am stuck here waitng for another fucking week for you to get back online and answer something from the last week. FUCK THAT SHIT. I fucking hate it and am so tired of it its not even funny. And you tell me your gonna write some fukcing email. Whatever i bet you dont write that email for atleast 2 weeks. In fact i guarantee you wont. And that is bullshit so i must have to wait for that fucking email on what ou want when it doesnt even matter because i know you want to be with whatever guy will have you now. IF ryan wont then you will take scot when you can have him. Or if im around then you will take me that is such bullshit and that is why i hate you for the things you have done. Because you act like i am so dispensable. That is why i must cut it off. To show you that i am not dispensable and that i have more self worth than that and that i can be happy without your ass. So what the fuck ever. have fun. i know you will. thats all you care about is what is in fromt of your damn face just like you have always been. you dont see the big picture never have and i dont think you eve will.....
