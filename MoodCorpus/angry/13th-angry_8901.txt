american society doesn't have a non-verbal gesture for thanks. we have one for hello, one for fuck you, and one for good job, but nothing to express gratitude. and i'm obviously not counting sign language, since it's a language, and i'm talking about purely non-linguistic forms of expression. it kind of makes sense, though.. i think most people tend to overlook the importance of thanking someone.

i feel really weird right now.. it's like a mix of anxiety and the nausea you get after spinning around a lot. it's making it very difficult to fall asleep.

i don't really have anything else to say, or do, and it's pissing me off because i really do want to go to sleep; i have a test tomorrow that i actually spent a lot of time studying for, and if i don't do well because i'm tired and unfocused then i'm going to hate myself and cry. this is why i hate working hard or getting excited about things, because disappointment is just about the worst feeling in the world.

ugh, why am i doing this?! i hate nights like this. i just wish i was asleep.
