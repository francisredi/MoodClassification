When people are mad, sad, or not-happy-feeling, do you tend to listen to happy songs or angry songs? If they don't feel into one or the other, which way do they lean towards? Cuz. I can't STAND listening to happy songs when I'm mad. Just cuz. Come on! When you feel like you want to absolutely punch someone's head off and feeling in general icky and not happy, why would you listen to OTHER people living in a HAPPY world with sunshine and bunnies and true love? Fuck that! When I'm mad, I want to know that I'm not the only person who feels this way. Misery loves company. I'm sure that's a horrible way of looking at the world, but when my world is not filled with sunshine, fuck you, I don't want to hear about OTHER people's SUNSHINEY life.

In other words, Lena came home and listened to Seo Taiji, something she hasn't done in a while. Good stuff. Note, Seo Taiji is good for happy mood too, it just works with everything cuz it's good. 

sigh. Humanity, or at least parts of it, are dumbasses. stabstab. 

PS: I miss my hamsters .... siiiiiigh. cry. I miss them lots. =( *SADFACE* siiiigh. I think the world would be a lot better place if hamsters ruled the world. Or if people were hamsters. How awesome would that be. sigh. We'd all be furry and happy and cute, and the biggest worry we'd have would be to run on that retarded wheel and climnb out of the cage through the water bottles. siiiigh. 

PPS: Go away, cold. You suck.
