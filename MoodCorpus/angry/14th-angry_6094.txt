leave me the hell alone
Ugh, everything & everyone is getting on my nerves lately. Its like everyone is 10X stupidier or more annoying than they usually are. 

I just dropped some metal case on my toe, and its cold so my feet are cold so it hurts 10x worse and put tears in my effing eyes. 

I have cramps, and i'm on my period (lightly), i'm not supposed to be on my period for 5 weeks and 3 days according to the pills...WHAT THE FUCCCCCCCCCCCCKKKKkkkkkkkkkklasjdflaskdjflaksdjflj. 


My life is stupid & boring & i haven't done anything fun in forever. i'm broke & i hate to work i wish i never had to work at crappy jobs that barely pay you above minimum wage that you HATE. i hate resturants & retail stores at the mall & every other crappy job i have ever had.

i took a 3-4 hour nap today & got 8 hours of sleep last night yet i am still exhausted...i am ALWAYS TIRED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

i ate fast food hours ago & i still feel completely full & disgusted from it. 

I hate people who are more spoiled than i am, i'm not a bitch about it, but they are. hahaha,i'm just jealous.

now i have gas & i'm pissed at my parents b/c they are annoying.
