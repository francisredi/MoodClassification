Stage: Anger
Just seeing the name "derek" or "gwyn" gets me so mad.
I just want to write out "I fucking hate him. I hate his ditzy girlfriend." but I don't actually hate them. I just want Derek to feel pain. That's wrong, no?
Do I care? No.
I can't wait until I just don't care about anything to do with D and G. I can't wait until I no longer feel these hatred-like emotions.
I can't believe how long it took me to realize how much of a fucking jerk he was.
I hate that I can't yell at him and tell him how much he's hurt me.
There's no point though, he doesn't care about me anymore. He's inlove with that dumb fuck and I'm just highschool drama. Fuck them both for saying that shit.
Also, I never plan on speaking to him again. If I ever see him I'll give him the dirtiest look, if he walks by me I'll jump back as if he's too disgusting to get close to. Because thats really how I feel.
Die die die.
I wish I never met or even heard of Derek Del Vecchio. I despise him for letting me feel such true love at my age. Selfish bastard you don't deserve happiness.

I'm gonna get famous and write a song about how terrible he is. And if he ever comes to see me play live, he'll immediately know the song is about him. Fucking asshole.
