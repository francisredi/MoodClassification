disaster
what was suppose to be a nice day out with my brother Kevin and my dad turned out to be a disaster. we went to see V for Vendetta. (regardless that I saw it already)afterwards I had informed them BOTH we were going to Applebee's. Now I happen to love Applebee's. We get there and my brother makes a stink because there is a crowd. i told him to wait let me see how long it would take to be seated. he just walked out dad followed. they headed for Burger King. I would have been fine with anything else but Burger King. I've gone there plenty of times when ever I end up in Co-op city/Bay Plaza. Fine what about the Chinese Buffet? We all like Chinese and an all you can eat buffet sounds cool right? wrong!! he didn't want that either.  he said to give him two dollars and he'd head home. in retrospect i should have let him.  but i figured that if he went home he would have told mom and she in turn would have raised high holy hell. so we all went home.  of course i'm still mad at him  we are on the bus just five minutes from home and he goes "I could go for some Applebee's"  now part of me knows he was being saracastic but the part that was extremly angry smacked him right on the bus.  he got mad and told me not to do that or he'd hit me.  I got angrier and opened my mouth he punched me in the back of my head. i fall to the floor. this guy comes out of Mc Donald's to see if I'm alright. i was. but grr. he and i... and the money.. and lazy bastard...

i learned my lesson though and NEVER plan on taking him anywhere again.. try to be a nice big sister and this is what i get.
