Insurance Companies are Evil
So Insurance Companies are Evil...especially mail order ones....i think they are trying to take over the world one person at a time...its a conspirarcy to kill us one bad prescription at a time.....thank goodness I have a wonderful husband who can bitch these awful people out!!

Shell got a new prescription plan called Caremark - well don't get fooled by their name because they don't care!!!!  I sent in my non-generic birth control prescription along with my non-generic payment & got back a generic perscription.  Then they preceeded to tell me its my fault!!!!!!!!  Apparently they say they have the  right to take my money & give me a generic...oh yes they credited my account for the over payment....yeah um what good is that going to do me???????  Its not like a mail order catalog where I can use my overpayment up on some drugs I might like!!!!

Come on people!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr ........ I payed for the good stuff now just suck it up & give it to me!!!!!!!!

Good day turned angry!!!!!!!!!!!!  These people are EVIL!!!!!!!
