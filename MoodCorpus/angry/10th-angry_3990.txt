I hate that the side of my thumb that I can't feel is the one that doesn't hurt.
I hate that I am sort of bleeding on my keyboard
I hate people who talk incesecently about how they danced in highschool, even though they suck
I hate the people who buld sets in Bozeman
I hate Bozeman
I hate people who think its ok to touch you, just because you're too nice to tell them to fuck off.
I hate the way my hair looks
I hate that my face is falling off
I hate that I'm not in some foriegn country learning a new language and a new way of life.
I hate that everything in life is so damned expensive.
I hate that it took nine times "meeting" my theater proffeser before she realized that I am in fact, in her class.
I hate over-thinking everything
I hate not knowing what my personality will be from one day to the next.
I hate that the boy-I-like and I can have conversations, but I am still too chicken to jump for the chance.
I hate being a phsycho-sarcasta-bitch geek
