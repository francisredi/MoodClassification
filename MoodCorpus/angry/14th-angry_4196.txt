Now at a state of war with the Alberta Motor Association
Right, I want others opinions on this because I'm too angry to think about this rationally.

I told my drivers ed trainer that I was working Saturdays back on March 26th, he said he'd try and find me another lesson for this week and give me a call.  I forgot about the lesson today and went to work, happy as anything, called home on my way to a movie (that I didnt see) and got told he called and said he was sending a bill for a "no show" fee.  One hundred bucks.... (I think) and the kicker of it is that hes supposed to call 24 hours in advance to confirm the sessions and didnt this time, and no he didnt leave a message with someone, we have call display and a voicemail, and neither show his call.  I want to challenge and fight this to the end, but my parents (that I'm still living with due to monetary reasons) are threatening to pay it if I try and fight it because "theyve been good to us in the past"  and honestly they cant afford it right now.  If the bill turns out to be like $25 bucks I'll just pay it and walk away, if its a hundred, I'll fight it til the collection agency is knocking on my damn door because I'll have worked the whole fucking day for the AMA.

please post your opinions, I want to know if I'm just too steamed to see this logically.
