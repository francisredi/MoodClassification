I...
I seriously hate so many things right now, but I hate them so much I can't even find the words to say how much I hate them and that's frustrating. For the past I-don't-know-how-many months, I've wasted so much time caring about a guy who came back to me under false pretenses... In short, it was all bullshit!!! This statement pisses him off as I've said it in about thirty different ways and, therefore, know that he hates it, but too f*cking bad! I mean, he came back a couple of months ago to apologize and then he said all of these wonderful things that I was stupid enough to believe and the whole time he was "engaging" with other women... That's how I'm going to put it... Basically, the stupid a$$ mother f*cker came back with the intentions of making me another notch in his bed post... Well, that doesn't sit well with me... Not at all...

So, since I've said enough bad things about him and I don't feel like going into anything further about it, I'm just going to end this here and say good night to the people that matter... And if the stupid a$$ mother f*cker is reading this right now, I hope that he knows that I don't want him to leave, but that he makes it damn hard for me to not wish that he'd never come back in the first place... I can't believe I wasted so much time on you when I have someone who actually gives a damn about me... That's f*cking all...
