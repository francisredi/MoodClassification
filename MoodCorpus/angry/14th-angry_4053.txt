For you, bitch (!)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hate you! I hate you, bitch. I hate you from myself and from himself... I hate you because it didn't work out between us. All your actions, all your dids, everything about you sucks. Because you... because you, bitch, your rotten, flirtens, imateur mind is only for sucks. Because you and your bitch, vollet, flirtens mind thinks only of inflicking pain. Your mind is so stupid that you just can't understand. Because with all your "good dids" (they are so ugly, that they make me sick and make me want to throw up, really) you're just not to able to feel and understand that there are living people. But it's ok... listen, bitch. It's ok that I'm in grief. It's nothing that I'm losing my mind from the pain. It's ok that my eyes are so red from so muth tears... Are you hear me, asshole? There will come a time that all will be ok with me... and with us. I'll deal with you, bitch (!) I'll deal with this situation, listen, I'll deal with this weather you like it or not. And you, bitch, will see me happy, smilling and you'll drown in your fucken shit, in your running poisoned spit. But I'll be unconserned about all this, and about you. Are you listing to me or not, as usual?
