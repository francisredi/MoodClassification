I'd just like to say that my brother is a great person, much better than I.

I was at his McLean hockey game last night, against Langley. Tensions were mounting all game and a fight eventually broke out, resulting in lotsa penalties and stuff for both sides. I saw my brother there - he was trying to pull one of his teammates out of the fight, his teammate shoved him away, and he skated off shaking his head and shrugging his shoulders, refusing to get into the fight. 

I had a lot of respect for him for not getting into that fight at this point already, but that respect multiplied when we got home and he explained what had happened. Kevin was clearing the puck from the zone and the whistle was blown for a penalty on another McLean player elsewhere, ending the play. A Langley kid came up and cross-back-checked him (using the stick to hit the body; hitting him from behind) at a dangerous distance from the boards, more than three seconds after the play ended. This is, oh, say, three or four penalties rolled into one. He fell to the ice, and when he looked up, his teammates were retaliating for him, which initiated the fight. And he didn't fight. He was blatently, blatently assaulted, and he had the cool to walk away, not do something to hurt his team. Of course it pissed him off, of course he was tempted to seek out the guy who disrespected him. The guy, some punk named Adams, had also slapped him earlier in the game for no reason, drawing a penalty. He didn't do anything then, he skated away. He didn't do anything this time, he skated away.

I would not have had the same self-restraint, in his situation. Kevin knows he could've fought back well; he didn't. I would've. I'm pissed off like hell at Adams for him. I know I'd have lost it. Kevin did not. I really admire him for that.

Hail Kevin Ji.
