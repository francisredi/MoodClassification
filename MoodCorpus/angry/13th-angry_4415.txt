tell me
So, today consisted of being really fucking angry all day.
For a mixture of reasons to be honest. I just want Charlotte to tell me whats wrong, i know that shes feeling really down at the moment and i just want to try and help/comfort her. The other reason i was angry today was because of fucking school, its getting so fucking dull, nothing interesting happens, and me being me cant handle that. I think the only thing that keeps me going in the is my meaty music and being a cunt to most of the people around me. 

All i can think about at the moment is the summer, RED HOT CHILLI PEPPERS and day time drinking, oh yeah NEWQUAY aswell i hope that will be amazing, i love being drunk with my sister.

Talking of my sister , she sent the family a postcard the other day, sounds like shes having a rave out there in the big open wolrd.

Tomorrow i have the music festival in the morning , i hope that goes alright, i hate playing in public. In the afternoon i'm seeing charlotte which ive been looking forward to all week, though she seems to be very uninterested in seeing me. 

Well, im off to go skating with harry, just had a nice skate up at the train station till they called the police, bunch of pricks, so now im guna go skate morrisons with harry.
