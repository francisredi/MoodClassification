I hate this damned disease.....
I hate it, hate it, HATE IT!!!
I hate being in pain all the time
I hate that I can't remember what I was going to look for just a minute ago
I hate that I can't remember when I last slept properly (if ever)
I hate feeling like I'm going to throw up
I hate that I want to eat dinner, but don't know if I can get something, and if I do, if I can actually eat it
I hate that I'm all alone here, and have no one to talk to
I hate that practically none of my family knows/believes/accepts that I'm sick, and what I'm going through
I hate that even typing this is absolutely killing me
I hate feeling like all the muscles in my body have disappeared, but somehow I can still feel pain in them
I hate that I have to write this here, and that possibly only one person will read it
I hate the fact that I don't have any friends who live in the same area as me, the same state or even the same country
I hate the way ME/CFS is made out to be some psychosomatic disorder, or that all sufferers are hypochondriacs
I hate feeling like breaking into tears all the time
I just hate it.....
