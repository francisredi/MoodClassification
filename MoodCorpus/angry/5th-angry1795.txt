Today's already Sunday. PERFECT.  In 8 hours 28 minutes time, I'll be in church, hoping not to see Jayes, but deep in my mind, I'll be yearning to look out for him. What's wrong with me!? Totally sucks. ): Emotions are evil. Yucks.
Reading a certain someone's blog makes me wanna punch her so bad she dies. Darren Hayes' So Beautiful makes me think. I don't know why, but it just makes me think. I'm not in the mood to do much now UGH I wanna get so angry but at the same time I don't think it's worth getting angry 'cuz I know that if I see Jayes in 8 hours 26 minutes time, I'd be enraged enough. I really don't know what to do! 
I seriously don't know why I'm talking about such stuff but yes I really can't help it!
Why is there so many "I don't know"s around ugh.
My brother taught me how to use/play the Playstation2 today. Okay so I've got something to do while being at home alone all day now! =D On Sunday there's gonna be Raising Helen on Starmovies I hope I watch it. Seems like a pretty good show to watch but I always say these stuff and end up not watching. See, I've got a problem.
