Its Just My Life-------------BORIIINNNGGGGG
YEP THATS RIGHT. MY LIFE IS BORING AGAIN. SINCE WE MOVED ITS LIKE I NEVER GET TO SPEND TIME WITH LARRY ANYMORE. I KNEW THIS WAS GONNA HAPPEN. I TOLD HIM IT WAS A BAD IDEA. I FEEL SO ALONE HERE. ITS LIKE IM IN A CELL. I WANT TO SCREAM AND RUN AWAY. BUT I LOVE LARRY SO MUCH THAT IM GONNA FORCE MYSELF TO SUCK IT UP. THERE IS SO MUCH THAT HAS TO BE DONE YET TOO. THIS WEEKEND WE NEED TO DO THE LAUNDRY, SWITCH THE ROOMS AROUND, GO TO BANGOR, BELFAST, AND WATERVILLE. I WANTED TO GO TO THE MOVIES CUZ LARRY SAID THATS WHAT WE WOULD DO EVERY WEEKEND, BUT HE TOOK IT ALL BACK. NOW HE WANTS TO GO PLAY BASEBALL INSTEAD. I DONT WANNA PLAY BASEBALL. I DONT EVEN WANNA WATCH. I WANT TO GET MY LIFE IN ORDER AGAIN. I FEEL LIKE IM WASTING PRECIOUS TIME. EVERYUDAY I LAY HERE AND REALIZE I DIDNT DO ANYTHING. MY LIFE IS 1/4 OVER. ALL I WANT IS TO LIVE MY DREAMS. I WANT TO GET MARRIED, HAVE KIDS, SING, ACT, AND LOVE MYSELF. I JUST WANNA BE ME. I HATE THIS BORING EVERYDAY LIFE I HAVE NOW. ITS LIKE IM BACK IN MIO WITH DOUG, WITHOUT THE ABUSE. I HATE IT I HATE IT I HATE IT!!!!!
