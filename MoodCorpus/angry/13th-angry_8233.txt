Screw the Day
Sorry no comic up date on "Action Food Now" or "Hand Drawn". I have miss placed the CD and I am just to dam lazy. I would have more energy, but its really hard to find the point. I left my other school because of stress and lack of support. I didnt realize it would be worse for me. I have no stress over classes other then voice cause there is little logic so her preperations, and trying to figure out German with the wrong IPA chracters is really annoying, and once you practice something one way its hard to get out of it. Most of my stress comes from the people I have pissed off, and well not really sure how or why. Dont bother asking if its you or anything like that. I will be talking to you in person the next chance I get. Things are not fun here cause I feel I have lost my support or realized I didnt have any at all. I feel that I should have just stuck it out and prayed to live to see another semester. Yes the stress was killing me. If anyone heard that dam monitar around my chest or saw me pass out would understand that it was getting bad. I have no idea of anything about it. I have called the docters twice now and have gotten nothing. I just give up. I hate doctors, I hate this bulshit I go through and I really hate the support I am NOT getting. LAZY PEOPLE SUCK. 

I wont call the doctors again. I am just going to wait till this heart thing gets worse. I know some of you will not like it but one the doctor i finally came to trust still hasnt responded to my monitar and it was sent in Dec, and the guy is leaving. I hate doctors they are a load of shit and I wont go any more. 

I just want to go HOME! But I HAVE NO HOME!
