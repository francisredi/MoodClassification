on my own, here we go
Do you ever just feel neglected?  Like someone you care about wants to purposely anger you?  Its like I can see them slowly drifting away in front of me, wanting to have intimate conversations, but not with me anymore.  Fuck, I hate when friendships change.  Maybe I'm just being paranoid, but I feel cast aside.  When am I ever good enough?  I feel like a child's Christmas toy.  Treasured for the first brief moments outside the wrapper, loved, adored, fawned over, perfect, then growing duller by the moment. I hate feeling unwanted, replaced...was it that easy to do?  Was I that insignificant?  Was I that plain, that you can trade me in?  I guess I always thought I was unique, what did I do?  Listen to the movies Kari-"You are not a unique and beautiful snowflake"-Brad Pitt, Fight Club.  I feel as if I invest so much in relationships, time, effort, love, care.  But then I never get in back in return.  Just let me love you, is that so much to ask?  FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FKUCF FUKLF KDJUFISDKFNKJDNF
