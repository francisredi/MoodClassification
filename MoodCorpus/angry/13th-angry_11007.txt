Fight!
Argh, someone here is ADDICTED to Soul Calibur II and it ain't me, baby :P FIGHT! YOU WIN! YOU LOSE! Save me please, save me. Maybe I'll be evil and hide the damn game while he's at work. Woah, he paused to eat and watch some G4 tv. Amazing.

Work is really pissing me off. We were checking the weekly sign in book, and it turns out that they shorted me 12 hours the other paycheck. How does that happen? It probably screwed up my ability to get healthcare because you can go one week under fulltime (35 hours) but not two and on that check it said 34 (which was correct due to that blizzard) and 32 and, in fact, it was 44 with 4 hours of overtime that week. Give me a break, sigh. I want to think that they're simply incompetent, but it seems a little too coincidental to happen the week my coverage would kick in. Coupled with the less than glowing report, compared to the screw up that got an amazingly positive one and then got written up for various things, I'm beginning to really sour on this job. Looking forward to a fun 24 hours working for these jerks this weekend :(
