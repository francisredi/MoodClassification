Just Some Stuff...
Hi everyone! I know, i update too much to have anything to talk about during every entry, but today I do! I got these new pajama pants, and they are totally awesome! They are red, white and black striped and have my school logo on it. They were made to support our band. WOOHOO!

Has anyone ever noticed that almost 100 % of people you ask what their least favorite subject is reply math? Well, that would DEFINATELY be my reply. I hate it-with a passion. My math teacher is SOOO extremely boring, and I don't understand anything she says. I guess I just have dysfunctional hearing OR MAYBE I'M A SELECTIVE HEARER! I HEAR WHAT I WANT, BUT BLOCK EVERYTHING ELSE OUT! I guess I don't like it because I get headaches easily, and it puts a major strain on my brain.

Yesterday we started a really fun art project! We were making an origami box, and I finished it today! Mine has pretty roses all over it- and I got a perfect score on it! HUZZAH! Anyways, I absoloutely love Art Club, but some of the girls in it are to...fangirly. I know I'm a fangirl. I know Breyzy and Yin are fangirls. (Hi, by the way!) But these girls are just...UGH I dunno what it is but I HATE THEM! The only things they watch are ADULT SWIM and FRUITS BASKET (which they could've just randomly picked up) and they HATE any other form of anime/manga. I HATE THEM! URGH! 

Anyways, sorry for the random rambles. I LOVE YOU GUYS!

Latta!
