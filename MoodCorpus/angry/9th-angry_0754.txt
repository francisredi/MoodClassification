phone troubless
i hate cell phones. i hate how people can call me, and how people can leave voicemails (i think i just hate that concept... i hate myspace messages and emails too), and how i got too dependant on mine. so basically, ever sicne i got back from mexico my phone hasn't been charging right. i can plug it all in, but it has to have the charger/phone connection be just right, or it won't charge. SOO i've been dealing with it, but it's been getting harder and harder because like yeah, it's hard to explain. anyway, last night it totally stopped working. and my phone was dead so yeah, my phone is dead. so i went to sprint after school and they told me it was probably my phone and i could either a) send it to the company to get them to look at it and maybe fix it, or b) get a new phone entirely. and they gave me the number for LG. and i don't want a new phone, nor do i feel like having LG look at my phone and tell me it's useless and charge me anyway.  so i get home and my mom tells dad and dad decides he's gonna look at it, so i gave him my phone and charger and yeah, my charger will work with his phone so it's not that it's my actual phone... ughh. so he's bringing it in tomorrow and yeah we'll see. at least i think this means i don't have to pay moola for whatever happens at this point.


i have so many plans going on it's actually pretty crazy.
