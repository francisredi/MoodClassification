I hated it. even though it might have come across that i enjoyed it. I didn't. I think my friend it mad at me. and i hate arguements. my make-up sucked. i was constantly getting labeled. my clothes made me look like a baddy fucking lazy ass fat wannabe punkish tramp. I mean i try to look nice but i just got low selfesteme. can't spell that word.I have a full blown bladder infection and my belly is hurting so much. but my mum won't let me take the day off school. We brake up soon. oh joy. i feel so pissed off.My best friend is half way across the world. I want her to come home. i need a trustworthy shoulder to cry on. i dnno this might make me sound emo. but i feel so freakin' depressed and lonely without Jasmine.

FOR FUCK SAKE SHUTUP. o well i'm depressed go on laugh at my expence that's all you'll do anyway. low lives. I hate you fucking all.
