Fuck 
Fuck. 
This word perfectly describes my current emotion. 
I hate the fucking bank. I fucking hate overdraft fees. 
I fucking hate money in general. 
I am fucked. I feel lost, and often ready to run. I feel defeated. 
They beat me. I am trapped in a corner getting blows to the head and back, precision spots of attack to demobilize a person. I cant run. My head is spinning, but it could just be the effect of my eyes rolling into the back of my skull, maybe the pulsating of my swolen melon is what leaves me in this pain. 
I dont understand. At what point of my life did accept the inevitability of tragedy? I cant move. To give up now and sacrifice my blood to the normal working class would be weak. I have had dreams. But they have since shrivled and died. This is the pruning of my existence. 
Where is my drive? Where is my want? Where is the unnacptance of failure that i so boldy stand by, but truthfully crave. I do not have the make-up of an achilles. Im on the ocean. I have sworn revenge upon the gods that beseeched me. And i am vulnerable for destruction. I dont fear death but i cringe at the thought of what it will take to kill me.  
I need a ciggarette, a joint and a bottle of Jack.
