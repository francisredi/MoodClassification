I hate life so much right now.. This retarded song is on the radio. "Sweetest Sin" by Jessica Simpson. Usually I wouldn't give a fuck, but this song was popular around the time val had just come back from canada, and Beth had just gotten divorced, they both professed to hate this song because it was "dirty" but behind closed doors they'd both had sex out of wedlock. Now I'm very unjudgemental about that, but when they go around saying "Like Omigosh! That is so wrong! I can't believe anyone would ever think about it, let alone sing a song! I feel like I need to talk to the bishop just for being near someone like that!" They're so two faced and it pisses me off.
EVERYONE is so two faced. I hate everyone so much right now because I know the person they are when they're alone is nothing like the person they are when no one is there.
I want to cut agian.. really bad.. I haven't for almost four months I think.. It's so hard to remember. 

I tried to purge about an hour ago.. Even with all the tips.. I couldn't do it. I just threw up a few mouthfulls of water, and what the hell does that do for me? I did get pissed off and start running, although I didn't make it very far till my legs gave out. I'm always kind of weak after trying to puke.. I wish I could have actually thrown something up though. I hate me so much.. I'm SO FAT.
