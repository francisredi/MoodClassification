This day Sucks
Mostly it's my own fault, my own making. I've been sick all week, I think that put me in a bitchy mood. 

 I was uber!bitch today, angry, hostil, bitterly sarcastic to nearly everyone I know. Only a few lucky ones were spared my wrath. 
 I think all the people I got really pissed off at and exploded at have been slowly pissing me off over time, little things just kept building up, and each one of them just did what they normally do-only to me, in my hyper sensitive angry state, I felt as if this was the MOTHER of it all and I just .... BOOM >O!!!

Why don't you shut your racist mouth? Are you going to be a bitch to me this whole period? You are boy, your penis makes you stupid. Are all examples of the things which I said to my (ahem) former? friends. 

 Mother says that if so many people made me mad, then it's something wrong with me. I guess she's right, but I can't help feeling as if they are to blame as well. I feel frustrated, at school I just get angry, I don't have patience for these people anymore. I don't know, I think I need to.. "find" myself again... This isn't how I like to be. 

 I feel like I just became Ty >_<!;;;;;
