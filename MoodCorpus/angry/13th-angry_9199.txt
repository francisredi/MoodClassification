I hate it when I lose myself..
I act like a fuckin' idiot. I get too riled up, and people get bothered for no reason. Nothing changes. I really need to work on anger management or something. *sighs and rubs temple* I kind of wish I could delete my last entry, but I suppose it'll be easier for me to deal with if I see it.

I let it get to me. This shit usually doesn't get to me like that. It's just..anyone would understand how I feel. I looked my whole life to find out why I felt so inherently different. I thought it was because I was an artist, then I thought I was gay, then I realise I'm therian, and even transgender. I still don't know if I'm gay yet! *amazed laugh* It's funny when you think about it. I let the stupid shit bother me. The integral utterly human part of me was hurt, and wanted to fight back. If I could, I would change a lot of things.

I have more important things to worry about. Graduation, college, work, the military, music, transitioning, peace. These are far more important things and I get hung up over the shit that these fuckers keep doing. Why does everything have to be such a fucking double-edged sword? It's so frustrating..
