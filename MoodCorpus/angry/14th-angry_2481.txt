Did you see how far he fell and how he made us suffer??
Like a child wanting her mother to comfort her after a bad dream. That's how I felt last night. though i didn't want my mother, i wanted the old steph, the old me, i cursed myself for letting my facade slip, for causing all of this, for realising, that even though i wanted to bear my soul at times, i could never conjure up the words, when it was the time for it. I hate touru, and to think, that SUCH a coincidence such as thinking about touru that day, and her journal entry, we still think alike. our personal thoughts have the same sources. but im sure the roles were switched. well next week we'll find out wont we. 

tomorrow i have an interview at LARS, and then sometime i leave for anchorage, and then next week i have my art due and the driving lessons to go to, so really, i cant even think about steph till next friday. i dont have the time. continue with your life. 

"little birds born without a mother or father, i can see their bodies forming in the swirling water, now there is another in the middle of my mouth, a hundred altogether within me now, little bird little bird come into my body...."

And i hate that cat Tim, i hate all that that stupid grey cat represented. I'd probably do it again.
