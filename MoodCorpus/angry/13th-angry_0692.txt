Bitch/Moan
I am so goddamn sick of her. I could punch her in her stupid, whining, bitching mouth. All she ever does is make demands or bitch or cry. She's like a fucking two year old and I can't goddamn stand her. All of them. I fucking hate all of them, and yes, their money is all that I care about. If they didn't give me money, which they barely do anyway, I would be so far away from this place. Bunch of stupid fucking whining idiots. I hate, hate, hate them, and if she comes pounding on my door one goddamn more time, I'm going to hit her in the fucking teeth.I fucking hate this, all of this, so fucking much. It's a veritable hell hole, with no way out and every fucking day is torture.I just wish they all would shut the hell up. Just SHUT UP! No bitching, no whining, no "woe is me", no shouting, just some goddamn piece and quiet for a change. That's the reason I stay in my fucking room all of the time. At least the door muffles their fucking mouths. Not enought though. Not enough for me to be sane. So, yes, leave me the hell alone, get off my back, and shut the hell up. For fucking once.
