chasing the ghost of a good thing
I don't know who will even get this, but...

I am so sick of this tear-down, rip-apart, backstabbing bullshit!
I mean, seriously. So-fucking-what if someone decides that just maybe, possibly, Beck is hurting them more than its helping them? I'm not for the people that trash the place because i know it's helped a ton of kids make friends, and of course become better actors. I love it there, most of the time, and even when i don't i know it's been such a huge part of my life in so many ways that i could never deny it. And the same thing is true for so many people, even some people who leave. I don't know. I hate that just because shes leaving everyone feels the need to destroy her. this isn't about abandoning you, or hurting you, this is about doing what is going to be best for her. 

Tomorrow i sign up for my last semester there because i graduate in may, and she's not going to be there, and you know, she really is one of my best friends, but i know this isn't about me any more than it's about any of you. This is about being ok. This is about growing up. I hate all the rumor-mill totally out of line cruel bullshit, just a week ago you were crying because they were trying to make her leave, but when she decides to herself you turn on her? She's trying to get better, get away from the drama. I can see that, I hate this, you know. I wish the rest of you could grow the fuck up.

this isn't to everyone. just the people who decided to 'destroy' her. thats just not cool. sometimes i'm a hypocrite, we all gossip, but this is bigger and worse and just fucking cruel. and i'm fucking sick of these games all the time. why can't we just love? 
Just stop.
