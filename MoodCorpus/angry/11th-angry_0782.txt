so yeah...
well, i tried working things out with my roommate. everything is ok i guess, but now soyoung is mad at me, and she got in a fight with her roommate. oh well. but supposedly i do make my roommate late in the morning by taking a shower, even though i ask her everyday if she is done(???) maybe if she woke up earlier she would also have time to finish? also, supposedly i listen to my music too loud? meanwhile she listens to her music without her headphones and blasts the tv all the time, so i just turn my music up louder. bitch. 

so after all of the drama that went on yesterday, i just wanted to talk to al, but i couldn't because she was in here, and so i wanted to talk to him today, but then he had to do things with his mom and then take pictures. so i am just really depressed right now since there is just too much shit in my life right now, and when i need al the most he isn't home, and he is just too busy in san juan with his friends. of course he could call, but does he want to? no because it would be disrespectful to his friends. meanwhile, i am the one here all alone and just need some kind of fucking company and support, and the only person that can give it to me in any form is not there. he only called once and it was only for a few minutes. he said he would be here by about 1, but i'm sure that he won't be here even longer than that. i don't have class until 10:30 tomorrow anyhow, but i still want to wake up at about 7 or so and just study for german, but i wasn't able to since i was just not in the mood. 

i have a headache again, and i'm hungry, tired, and cold. whenever i need someone, they can never help me. i always have to be by myself. 

i also want to dye my hair blue next time....maybe purple too...hmm. the dark burgundy color is already coming out and looks pink again. hahaha. what ever happened to permanent colors? 

i hate it here, can i say it enough?
