Grrrrrrrr
Damn work.  There were so many dishes, I wanted to cry.  And the sink over flowed with icky trash hdisposal food and it wasn't my fault.  There was a lot of stuff on the machine when I left, which is bad because I work at 6:30  tomorrow morning.  Everyone is going to be like, why is there so much stuff on the machine, don't you night people do anything?  And to that I will angrily reply something like this:  Shut up you bitch ass hoe.  I don't want to hear it.  

The night went bad because, like i said, there were lots of dishes, and one of my lovely co-workers had to leave early.  That makes me mad.  Why the hell can't people make it their business to stay the whole 3 and a half hour shift!!!!!???????  You work part time!  And did I mention for only 3 and a half hours?

And I'm working the bitch-girl's shifts this weekend.  Had the supervisor told me who I was working for, I wouldn't have taken it because this girl does not deserve favors.  She is mean and ugly and fat.  And I can call her fat because she is mean.  So there.

I am particularly mad at one of my superviors.  She told me that she wanted to give Jared a job.  I told Jen and Jared this, and she hasn't called him about an interview.  I'm mad because number one, I look like a fool to Jen and Jared.  Number 2, she never listens to what I say.

And to think, just before I went into work today, I was thinking how everything was finally getting better.  Brett was right, I should not expect anything to get better.

Rarrrrr.  I'm going to take a shower and hope my mood changes.
