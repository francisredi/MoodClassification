10 Reasons Why I hate MTV
Reason #1: Bam Margera
Reason #2: Advertising HIM. I Don't Want any fucking 6 year olds at a HIM concert. 
Reason #3: Johnny Knocksville, I hate You.
Reason #4: Carson Daily, You are a worthless piece of life.
Reason #5: DJ Scribble, Come On Seriously?
Reason #6: Laguna Beach.
Reason #7: The Osbournes, as much as I love watching a 60 year old doped out crack head if I really wanted to then I would just goto a fucking Rolling Stones concert.
Reason #8: That show with the guy from OTown. Okay seriously why are you so broke? You were in a boy band that made million and have your own tv show. You are a dumb ass and thats enough said. If I saw you I would punch you, or maybe put you back in the 3rd grade so you can learn math.
Reason #9: Is there a TV channel that you don't own?
Reason #10: Whatever happened to Music Television? Where is the music, if I watch TRL it shows a wehole 10 second video clip. If I want to watch a video I have to subscribe to MTV 2, thats bullshit. And where the hell is Beavis and Butthead? 

Did I mention that I hate the following Networks:
MTV, MTV 2, MTVU, MTV Espanol, MTV Latino, MTV UK, Nick at Nite, Nickoleoden, CMT, VH1, VH1 2, and any other channel that brings happiness to 6 and 7 year olds world wide.
