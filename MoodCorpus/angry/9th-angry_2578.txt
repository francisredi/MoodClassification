God damn.
I hate myself, and my obsession with having an extremely busy and tiring sedule. I try to cram so much into my schedule, so I have no time for anything spontaneous or different, or creative. I now even have a bedtime of, like 8 or 9 o'clock so I can get up at 3 in the morning (though I never follow it) I am on a timeclock, 24/7. work, school, work, rehearsal, sleep. I can give you the exact times I have to be at each, and what busses I take to get from one to the other. I don't even have time for my sewing, and I swear, that's the only thing that's been keeping me sane latly. but my time for that is even dwindling. I was bored before, so I got a job, and now I want more free time. I'm never satisfied. And I hate the music Angie was playing just now.
How is it that someone can be both perfectly happy, yet so emotionally unstable and torn up inside? I mean, I don't really get sad anymore. I'm starting to become fairly good friends with Sheila and Kyle, so I'm happy about that, but... now that I think about it, i just... hate it. I hate how happy I am, because I know that I souldn't be. I WANT MY FRIENDSHIPS BACK!! Is that so much to ask for?
I guess so, considering my schedule...
