I hate LCD!
So today the service man was here.
He repaired the problem with the pc *little hurray* (no warning message anymore)
Then he saw my LCD and said - oh yes, you are right, there is something wrong with it. And because it was in warranty he said he'll give me a new one. So I have a new LCD and gues what? I hate it. There are no smeary parts on the inside of the screen now, but it looks like if I had little horizontal lines on the screen. ******* (insert lot of rude words here)
Plus the previous monitor was a bit pinkish this screen is bit greyish.
Oh yes, LCD's are great!
I hate them to bits!!
I wish I had no problems with my eyes so I could buy me CRT again... *big sigh*

Oh, and if you wonder about the colour of my icons, wallpapers, etc... well I can't see proper colours on LCD monitor so... well... I guess I'll have to live with it.
I don't know if I should go and tell him about this LCD - I'm scared what the next monitor will be like...

When I have days like this, I always have to tell myself - it still could be worse...
