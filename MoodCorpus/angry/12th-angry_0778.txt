Shit...
I fucking hate my job. I hate the way that I'm always tired now, and don't ever feel like doing anything. I hate never having any money for myself. My bank account had over-draw today. So, now they're charging me $31 fucking dollars cause I went over by $3.90. That's bullshit. That means that when I get paid this week, I'm going to have nothing left over. I hope nothing else goes threw, so they don't charge me more. I hate banks. After I get my account stable again, I'm not going to do anything with it. I'll just keep cash at all times. This shit is Josh's fault, too. He keeps making me order shit for him for his stupid fucking game. He actually said that he didn't give a shit if he made me over-draw. He wanted me to order something for him today, when he knew I had already over-drawn. He was like, "You can over-draw more." This is coming from someone who owes his fucking bank around $400. He's an inconsiderate asshole sometimes. All he cares about is his stupid games...

I guess I'm not going to be able to buy anything for a long time. I'm going to keep my word to certain people about things I'm going to buy for them. You know who you are. Just give me some time, and I'll deliver. I'm feeling like shit right now, so I'm going to bed. I have to work tomorrow night...
