Bills bills bills
Northeastern still hasn't gotten back to me, although I called them and harassed them yesterday. It's so frustrating. I started inundating places with applications yesterday again, in case this doesn't pull through. I hate hate hate am so sick of filling out of applications. It sucks. Half the jobs I apply for tell me to my face that I'm overqualified, because they know I won't work there forever. The other half look down on degrees. Gah.
I have an interview at Stonewall Kitchen tommorrow. I applied to be a cashier, but the lady called me yesterday and said I would be qualified to be an account executive, and she was going to forward my resume. Apparently it went through because she called, so I'm off to HR at Stonewall tommorrow. if they offer me the job, I'm going to take it, start working, and get some money. I don't know how long northeastern is planning on taking but if its any longer I'll be towards my retirement age. 
I just want to be able to buy things again. And do stuff thats not sit around the house. i was so bored yesterday I cleaned everything. EVERYTHING. Except my room. The kitchen was spotless. i crawled behind the toilet and scrubbed out years of filth. The plug in the sink got stuck and I had to sacrifice a fork to getting it un-so. I baked cookies. i made a cake. Its getting ridiculous. I drove around applied more places.
SOMEONE JUST HIRE ME already.

Also I was having one of the most interesting dreams I've ever had in my life this morning and all of a sudden I was awoken from my sound sleep by someone who called my phone, said "Oh, I was trying to call the school" and hung up. And now I will never know what happened in the dream where I was a 17 year old pioneer boy,my mom was Felicity Huffman, and I was about to take the virginity of a 15 year Indian girl who was disowned by her father because of our relationship.
