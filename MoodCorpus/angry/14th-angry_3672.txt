what...?
humans are evil, I am evil, I hate my species right now, I just don't understand how I can be hurt so much by a simple statement that somebody that is barely in my life uttered. I mean all I was trying to do was help out. the thing is I think I am more angry at myself for leaving myself open to such a simple wound. I realize now more than ever that, I am very sensitive to certain remarks, that, actually wouldn't carry much weight, if, they were delivered from somebody that I didn't care about as much. why do I let myself fall into these situations? what is wrong with me? how is it that I can be offended by causing somebody else offense, where did I go wrong in life? when did I start being such a fraking pushover? who did I piss off to be born on this world? who did all of us piss off to be born in this world? why is it that the things that are most worth doing are very much the hardest things to do? I hate this, and what I hate even more is that I assume that people will make ugly assumptions after reading this. it all comes down to... what is wrong with me? really, I would like to know.
