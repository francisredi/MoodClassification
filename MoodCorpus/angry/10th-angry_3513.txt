Random thoughts
Before talking about our latest programming assignment, my prof. wrote up on the board "SOL Assignment" where he writes all the things we're going to talk about today.  I looked at that and thought "Shit Outta Luck Assignment".  SOL = Self Organizing Lists, but I'm thinking Shit Outta Luck would be more accurate.

I'm beginning to think I'm a lesbian because my boyfriend is more of a woman than I am.

Having my ex-boyfriend pop into my dreams at random points kills any sexual desire I have for any man for the first hour or so after I wake up.  This makes morning sex difficult.

I hate when my co-workers invade my workspace, it makes me feel claustrophobic.

Along those lines, I'm never sure whether I'm actually claustrophobic or whether I just don't like people.

I have ideas for what I want to do when I get out of college, my problem is I don't think I can do anything.

When one thing goes wrong right at the beginning of the day, it really fucks up the rest of it.

It sucks being able to read someone so well sometimes, because then I can't ignore when I KNOW they're upset.

Assholes suck...especially since when you don't want them to talk to you anymore they suddenly have all the time in the world to harass you.

I hate feeling like nothing I do is enough.
