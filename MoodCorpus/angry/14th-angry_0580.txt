i want this week to be over so bad. uggghhhh so tird!

we started reading julius casear in english today and reminded everyone of mean girls ("brutis is just as good as casear!") lol. i need to watch that movie again, its awesome. i really hate it in religion right now b/c we basically debate every class and some ppl annoy me so much b/c they think they're ALWAYS right and they really have no idea what they're talking about, and claiming the president lied to us is not a good argument so shut the hell up. k? lol yes im angry :D but it annoys me... aaaaaand we're making hot air balloons in chemistry fun stuff. and our retreat got cancelled. which i was prolly gonna have to go to anyway so im kinda happy.

ugh i wanna give up on everything so bad. i dont really wanna give a shit about school anymore and i even wanna just quit dance b/c i never wanna go b/c im so tird all the time.  I NEED SPRING BREAK SO BAD RIGHT NOW!

8th & ocean tonite- maybe? b/c of above tiredness i might go to bed. but then again i need my teddy fix...
