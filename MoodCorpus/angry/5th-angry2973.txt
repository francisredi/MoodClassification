job advertisers should be required to show that they are showing a position for a dodgy job, then again that no experience necessary should have been enough of a warning for me. I fucking hate rocking up fully dressed up to realise its for a pos job, on the otherhand I got to make a bit of a scene. I hate wearing a tie, I hate wearing formal business clothes, I hate all that bullshit, what I love though is saying "OH FUCK THIS" loudly after talking to the recruiters then turning around and walking out with everyone else in business clothes staring after you .D 


yeah, no one is ever going to employ me .( wish it was easier to join the French Foreign Legion, then I'll just run off with them. All I need is food and a place to sleep and young non english speaking people to take complete advantage of *spits in teh face of one of those starving 3rd world children and walks off* 


I'm not saying that I'm above that kind of employment (anyone employed is superior to me, for now) but I've done that kind of marketting shit before and its fucked .D
