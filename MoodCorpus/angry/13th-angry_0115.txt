3 Cheers for a Shitty ass weekend!!!
So Friday...was the mass for my father that my mom always makes a big deal about.

It was perfect, she was shit faced and I acted like my father. It was very fitting. As soon as the mass was over I wanted to go home (middleboro) but i knew I had to stay until Sunday afternoon.  My mom didn't even have dinner with me on friday becuase she doesn't eat when she is drunk. We didn't go to the cemetary, not that is a bug deal for me, but i figured... I didn't get to hang out with anyone cuz no one was around.  So way, the weekend really sucked.

My mother spent a good part of Saturday wasted too. I got my hair done and by the time i got back she was pretty out of it.  We had lunch together with my aunt (who has the similar problem with her mother as I do mine, difference is her mom is not a drunk, and my aunt is blind-but she is still treated like she is 5, depsite the fact that she is 49 and lives on her own.)  I hate going out to eat with my mother when she is drunk.  She makes the whole experince much less enjoyable.  And I've come to the realization that I really just don't like my mother.  It's not that I can't stand her, or that I hate how she treats me, and all that other crap that I complain abotu all the time.  There really is nothing abotu my mother that I like.  I hate spending time with her, i hate talking to her...and yeah, how else can you like a person if you don;t like spending time with them or talking to them?

Sunday she was sober, but she still manage to piss me off with her constant questioning. She can be quite tiresome.

So money is still tight-does any one have ideas as for a partime job that I wouldn't want to kill myself at?
