Boo fucking hoo
That boy is going to fucking die. Im going to kill him. How dare he? How DARE he?!?! Ok, a good friend of mine Desire is getting married. Her mother and I are really close, the woman has adopted me. They know Michael. Friend of the family. Desire and her mother wouldnt keep anything from me, good or bad. If my name comes up I know it. Desires mother comes into where I work telling me that Michael called me a lesbian. Not just a lesbian, but a bisexual lesbian. Ok...how does that work? Youre either straight, bi, or gay. Thats it. Now, I do admit to being a bisexual. And I really dont give a good god damn if people know it. Its not like I go around flaunting it, but if Im attracted to someone I'll go for them. But thats not the point. He went and told her that, but thats not it. Im a bitch, Im mean, I say horrible things to him, he hates me, 
AND Im a hypocrite. 

A hypocrite. 

How dare he. 

I swear to God he'll regret the day he ever fucked with Vo Twist
