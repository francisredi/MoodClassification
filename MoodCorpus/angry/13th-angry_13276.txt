What the Hell
Does going to an institution and taking college level classes, taking pre-calculus as a sophomore and living by yourself and dealing with parents 300 miles away, and dealing with money at 16, and having college staring at you in a matter of months, and having numerous people who you won't have for support next year, and dealing with other people's two faced bitchy attitudes really what I should be going through???????!!!!!!!

I am SOOOOOOO DAMN TIRED of dealing with people not being real, or if they are being real, then that scares the shit out of me...Sorry for all this language, but I am in one hell of a mood, and the smiley faces at the bottom of this thing probably don't cover it. I am pissed, jealous, mad, sad, angry, empty, wanting-something-out-of-reach-right-now, tired and tense all at the same time. There are no words for this.

Don't really know what to say, because there are no words...have any of you returning ASMS'ers gone through this??????

Mahone wants to use the song I wrote in his next film...*smile*

I'm tired enough...written enough...im going to attempt to try and go to sleep...whatever

What the hell...
