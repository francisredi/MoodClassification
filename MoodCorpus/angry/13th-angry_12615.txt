exam anxiety
fuckkk! HSC mid yearlies are in a week and i havent started revising at all. i spent my weekend shopping (saturday) and literally lying around the house all day doing nothing (sunday). what the hell is wrong why me? why dont i have any motivation to study? im not even scared as i sually would be during exam time. gosh, im not even freaking out, which (if you know me well enough) is the norm for me at this time of the year. ahhhhhhhhh im so angry at myself! Honestly though, i seriously cant b fucked to care about the concequenses of not studying.  holy moly i need to get a grip right now!!! ok action plan for this week:
- do not touch computer as of after i shut down today (which means btw that i wont be blogging till mid april. =( bye bye blog readers) ack! generally i mean: no MSN, no blog reading, no personal blogging, no OHNOTHEYDIDNT!, no postsecret, no vouge forums, no SMH, NO DOWNLOADING MUSIC OR DH, OC + VM. *cries a river*
- stop lazing around the house and eating after school (actually, must stop this completely as its making me fat)
- stop reading the newspaper (which basically means stop reading the trashy "S" in the sun-hearld, radar, domain and cartons)
- stop pointlessly watching TV after school because i hate the programs anyways (shows consist of: Hi-5, Fifi and the Flowertots, It's Academic, B&B - my gosh they're bad shows.)
- stop making stupid pointless lists eg. what i need to buy, what i need to do, what i plan to have for lunch, how much moeny i can scab off parents for the week etc etc)
- and lastly, stop having naps!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

hahahaha im so angry for a nerd. 8D
