Fuck Peter
I am so fucking tired of Kaela defending Peter. He is so fucking menatally abusive. He is such a fucking prick. She told me not to lecture him about the way he treats her. She told me that he's going through a lot more than she thought. Bull shit. Maybe he's having an actual moral delima over the metaphorical fucking around he's doing. He deserves more than his own guilt. If he's feeling guilt but not fixing it then he obviously needs shown right from wrong. Who knows what she thinks he's going through. -Oh, he misses me so much that he has to compensate by flirting with other girls- -Oh, he lacks a father figure and has lived his life with an overbearing mother figure so he needs to assert his masculinity by being a manipulative little bitch- No. Fuck that shit. Fuck him fucking over my best friend the way he does. Fuck her for taking it and making me take it with her. Over and over again I have to comfort her, but never, not once do I get to try and actually change anything. I wish Kaela weren't so god damned short sighted. It is not OK to be an asshole for no reason. It is not OK to treat your girl friend like shit. It is not OK to dump the girl you supposedly love so that you can have the best of every world. That is cheating at life. That is Peter. I can see him defending it. -Well it makes me happy, and Kaela's obviously OK with it since she still loves me, so who is it really affecting?- Fuck that selfish small minded piece of shit all to hell. Fuck Peter.

I'm so angry that I that I had to log off of IM so as to not get in an argument with Kaela. Because she's stupid. There's no other justification for her getting mad at me for being mad at the boy who is using her heart like a god damned roll of toilet paper. What he's doing is sad and perverted and creepy and wrong and infuriating and only understandable from the perspective of other creepy perverts like Joel. I like Joel, but I don't think he really sees the girls that he dates as people.
