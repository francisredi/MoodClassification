Evil SPAM!!!
For the past few weeks i've been recieving alot of paypal/ebay spams. all of them were saying i need to update info or that my account was suspended or something. well lucky for me my yahoo!mail spamed it for me so it was all in the bulk folder and though i opened it to double check, i deleted it. Since my yahoo!mail is soo anal, i check my bulk from time to time just to make sure. Today i recieved the most evil of all evil ebay spam emails! This one came as a item selling question. I was like curious that it got spamed. and i wasn't sure what the item was so i clicked the item number and brought me back to the ebay site... well it was a FAKE EBAY SITE. I was about to type in my screen name, but it hit me. my modzilla has my SN saved on the comp so it should already be typed in.... the only thing that shouldn't be there is my password. So i decided not to sign in from there and went back to my own ebay link on my toolbar to sign in and check my messages from my ebay inbox. in my inbox was no new messages AHA!~ EVIL SPAM was caught. and to double double check i went back to the spam email to look at the item number and checked it with my item numbers on ebay... totally different! THAT'S RIGHT EVIL EBAY PAYPAL SPAMMERS! I CAUGHT YOUR ASS! WHO DO YOU THINK YOUR MESSING WITH BITCHES! YOU CAN'T MESS WITH ME! I'M FUCKING SMARTER THAN Y'ALL BITCHES ROT IN HELL!
