GRR!!
GRAH!! My dad is being a total b-tard. D: Whenever I raise my voice a mere decible at my sister, EVEN WHEN SHE DESERVES IT, he goes off at me. But when she screams bloody murder at me for TAKING A SIP OF HER SODA, he does nothing but laugh. At who? Me. I get mad because she does things like SHE'S the older sister, and I'm some insignificant bug.

Its people like my sister and people like my dad that drive people like me to the psychiatrist. Why? Because they think people like me bottle up their anger. Well I can't EXPRESS my anger, dammit. Even as I type this he's yelling things at me. "I hope thats a positive message you're writing! I hope its not one of those things you'll look back on in a couple of years and say 'Man, I was a crabby butt.'"

*screams bloody murder*

There, I think I feel better now. Kinda. I didn't really scream.

My left hand has suddenly been taken with arthritis too. My elbow as well. My whole forearm aches, actually, including my hand. Like all the bones need to pop or something.
