Stupid fic


Ugh, I love my two fics I have started.  I really, really do.  I love how they start and the main things that are going to happen in them, and where they are going to go.  

But I hate the fecking in between chapters!!!! They're so boring to write and think about.  Trying to create the link between the main things that I want to happen.  I get all excited about writing again and then realize I have to write a "filler" chapter and all of my enthusiasm goes right out the window.  I hate writing them.  Ugh, they suck.  So much.  But I know I need them, every chapter can't be filled with action.  But then I think if I hate writing them, people will hate reading them, and I wouldn't want that at all.

So then I just don't want to write.  Well I do, but I don't want to write the filler chapters, I want to write the dramatic/cute/sweet/crazy stuff that I have planned.  The stuff I'm excited about and that keep popping into my head randomly.  WHY ARE THE FILLER CHAPTERS SO BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!

Sorry 'bout that, it's just a bit frustrating... I want to get them done, but damn those filler chapters and their boring uselessness.
