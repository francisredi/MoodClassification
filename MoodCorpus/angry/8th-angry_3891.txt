Wrath Unleased
I hate living with my parents. And I can't fix this because:
I hate the fact that I've sent out... 17 resumes (singularly) and 32 applications (11 with resumes) AND NO ONE WILL HIRE ME!!! 
I hate it. I hate it I hate it. Yes my dears PMS is here with a vengence. I've checked my resume every single time I've printed on e out to send out for spelling errors or any other mistakes that may keep me from at least talking to someone. I'm getting SO frustrated. I hate living here with a passion, but I can't get out because there is no way I could pay rent on my own. I hate it. I hate it so freaking much. I just want to get married. I want to get married. *SIGH* But Joshua who is frustrating me at this moment will not get on the ball and call the apprenticeship program to get in. I realize he wants to get his car fixed first, and that's fine, but I want him to do it and he's not. Impatience at its best. 
So I have to go take a shower and get ready to go be cheerful at work. 
*expletive*
