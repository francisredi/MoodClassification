overdue, i guess
I guess I should recap...or somethingSchool still sucks, I need may to be here, right nowI saw my lil bro the other day for his bday! He's such a little nut!I got this crazy phone call that didn't exactly upset me, but it did make me laugh. but in light of recent events (last night) I don't think it will happen anymore. Can't figure out if I am happy about that or not, but I guess eventually everyone has to move on. He just travels faster than I originally expected!&nbsp;I honestly can not stand, or understand the male species. So I officially stop trying. They don't make any sense too me. Oh and I don't know what you have been saying to my friend, but I do not need to begin to tell you how beat up that is. Side note, dont say "I dont want to lead you on...blah blah" and then call me beautiful. And don't flirt with me and then say you don't think you are ready for a relationship, and don't then continue to do little sly things, IDK, maybe I should just say "Dont talk to me" or something, rawr! I love my wifey, by the way. She totally had my back last night when I completely broke down.&nbsp;Luckily for me she was there or my room probably would have been even more destroyed than it was when I woke up this morning.&nbsp;She keeps me sane at times.&nbsp;So last night was plan awful! I hate boys, I hate drunk people, I hate slutty girls, I hate jealousy, especially when i am the one feeling it, I hate liars, I hate people who pretend like everything is ok, but even more I hate people who let all there feelings show all the time. But most of all, I hate people who let a bad experience keep them too afraid to try anything else... :(Tonight better be fun, I plan to chill with my ladies, they are all I have! My bro is up here for a bit, maybe I will see him later tonight, maybe not..Ok I am out, I have nothing left to bitch about
