unbogging the cranium...
two issues:

First, what the hell is up with shooting someone dead instead of just incapacitating them or tasering them?  It makes me so angry that the government shot this guy dead and asked questions later.  Do they really think people in their right mind are going to run around screaming "I have a bomb"?  I have two members of my family that are bipolar and all I could think of was "it could have been them".  I really hate the U.S. right now because we have become a nation of rednecks that preach intolerance.  It probably isn't helped that our leader is a redneck.  This makes me so angry and I am powerless to do anything about the situation.  My deepest sympathies go out to the widow and the family of this man.  I think their should be some type of inquiry and reprimand.  Of course, that won't bring him back...

Second, I swear that Ryan missed the memo that I was done with his ass.  I get so sick and tired pretending that nothing is wrong when everything is wrong at the moment.  I want to find someone that really cares about me (see previous entries)...and I don't want him in tow when I do it.  He thinks that things are the same and that I am just at his beck and call to say whatever he wants to me.  I am sorry that I can't be there to stroke his ego and make him feel better about himself.  I am sorry that I feel the need to get out of a bad situation and feel better about myself.  How stupid I am to think I can do better all the way around...I hope that everyone can detect the sarcasm oozing from the last several lines.
