UNH and my birthday weekend was amazing. im still in sooooo much pain and there is a bruise in the perfect shape of a cleat on my leg and it hurts to walk but i still had a great time. but im so done with being a rookie. i understand the whole vet/rookie thing but im a rookie not a slave. some people just dont understand that though. 


im a horrible friend. i honestly sux. but i didnt mean to do it. im never drinking around boys again because i end up getting drunk and kissing them. no, they kiss me and i dont stop them. so its kinda the same thing but a little different. but honestly to have a guy who is interested in kait want to hook up with me too made me feel good about myself. kait is my best friend and i luv her to death but i hate being around guys with her. shes so much prettier than me and she is on a whole different level and guys notice this. everyone i am remotely interested in like her and she always gets them, even if she doesnt want them. and im jealous. hate to admit it but i am. and i feel horrible about what i did and i sux and on a certain level i should just cease to exist but at the same time something made me feel good about myself. for like 20 seconds anyways. now i just feel worse. i hate myself. 


oh and i also hate scumbag. too bad he'll never know.
