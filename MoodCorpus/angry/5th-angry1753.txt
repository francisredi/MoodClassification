GAH GODDAMNIT another mozzie bite, another one! i have coated my room in fly spray so thick that i'm going to  be smelling like it for years to come, and yet they still thrive.

WHY???????????????

I may have just killed my daddy-long-legs with it, which is a bit upsetting, but it's not like he was doing his job. He's supposed to be keeping the mozzie numbers down! I have seven mozzie bites on a body already itchy to hell with the drugs i'm on. And they've bitten me through clothes most of the bites i have are on my thigh, always covered with my pjs. And i'm doubly allergic to mozzie bites. I'm on anti-histamine drugs and i'm coating them with hydrocortisone, two combinations that always work, and it's not! it's bloody not! i'm itching like hell. And to make matters worse, if you thought that was possible, there's a bug trapped in a web. I keep trying to sleep to the sound of BUZZING as it makes frantic efforts to free itself. I have no idea where it is, or i would have put it out of its misery a long time ago. 

i think it might be one of these uber mozzies i have in my room.

GAH

EVERYTHING ITCHES AND IT'S TOO HOT AND I CAN'T BLOODY WELL SLEEP

so goddamned tired of this!! but obviously not tired enough to sleep.

gah Gah GAHHHHHHHHHHH
