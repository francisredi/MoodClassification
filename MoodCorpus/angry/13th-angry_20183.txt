I HATE MOWING!!!!
I hate mowing and weedeating the lawn!!!!  It's the worst chore there is!!!!  Doing the dishes is WAY better than mowing the lawn.  

My legs are sore, my body is sticky from the heat, my left arm is shaky and has no real strength.  I hate that I have to do this like every other week or I'll end up having to pay $40 to the stupid ass, fuck-tards that is the trailer park that I live in.  

Every year...and I mean EVERY FUCKING YEAR they raise my rent by $21...I don't know why it's that dumbass odd number it is.  And in 2 more years I will be paying MORE per month in lot rent than what I'm paying for this piece of crap for a house!!!!  Do they offer any new amenities to the rent hike?  NO!  Do they go ahead and hire a life guard for the summer so kids could play just a bit safer at the pool with the money they keep milking from us every month?  NO!  Do they offer free lawn service for there ever constant need for the perfect lawn on their property that they are renting to us out of the kindness of their fucking greedy ass hearts?  NO!!!!

Anyway...back to original rant...I HATE MOWING & WEEDEATING LAWNS!!!!
