Well Ive got good news I went to the doctor and Im not pregnant. Yay but Im kinda sad because I kinda want a baby. But all I know is that I need to go to Lansing or Jackson to see all my peeps over there 'cause I miss them all.  I swear to fucking God that all this fucking shit is getting on my mother fucking nerves. my fucking boyfriend cheated on me and he cant fucking trust me. Thats fucking bullshit. Im not even sure I want to be with him anymore because all we fucking do is fucking fight. He says that he wants to be with me for the rest of his life and he wants to marry me, but I dont understand how its going to work if we are always fight. I really dont think this shit is going to work. So fucking what if his boy wants to get in my pants. I need a ride back to my apt and his boy is the only one that can give me a ride he should trust me that I wouldnt do anything if I was going to cheat on him I would have done it a long time ago. Ive had so many oppertunities, but I didnt because I love him to death and I would die for him. I even stopped talking to my fucking ex that was still a friend. But what the fuck ever I dont know and I dont fucking care anymore. If this shit keeps happening Im just going to tell him that Im done because its getting real old real fucking fast. This is why I need to fucking get the fuck out of this fucking part of the fucking state. I just want to see my fucking boy Troy and my bestest friend in the whole wide world Nenna. Jeremiah wanted me to promise him that I wouldnt hurt myself anymore and I told him that I wouldnt because I didnt want to break a promise and the funny thing is that hes the reason that I want to hurt myself. I HATE MY FUCKING LIFE THIS IS FUCKING BULLSHIT.
