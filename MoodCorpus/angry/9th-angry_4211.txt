an unfortunate series of I hate you letters...consider this my update
Dear Alyssa's Enter Key, I hate you for not working. Dear My Laptop, I hate you for not having internet service.  Dear Netflix, I hate you for disappointing me day after day. You say you will deliver my movies fast and on a certain day, yet when I get home from work, they are not there. You are making my day worse when you should be making me smile. Dear Diseases that Plague my Existence, I hate you for not allowing me to eat what I crave on a daily basis and for making me swallow those awful protein shakes that I have been calling power shakes to possibly make me feel better about it. Dear Absentmindedness or early Alzheimers, Please please please stop existing. I hate how I often I cant find my liscense and debit cards. Now its been three days since I can remember having them and I've had to cancel my check card which leads to another I hate you note.. Dear PNC, Die! I hate you for having the worst customer service help line ever. Every time I try to request a new card, I get redirected to some moron who can't help me. And since I have no check card, I have no money which leads to... Dear Cosi Dress Code, I hate you for requiring me to wear dress shoes when I run around all day. Now I have to go buy new dress shoes for tomorrow but I can't thanks to PNC and my alzheimers. Dear HR BLOCK, I hate you for not allowing me to file my taxes without an ID. You were my one hope at getting money to get the new liscense and new shoes which reminds me...  Dear PNC, I hate you for not allowing me to get money out with my student ID and a check because I didnt have my license..which I was going to use the money to go get.. Dear DMV, please send my new car registration and camera card so I can get my new license faster. Atleast then I wont have to pay 10$ to get a replacement license to get me through several days until I get my new license since this one is expiring in two weeks. Dear Philly Streets, I hate you for having potholes. Now I have another flat tire which I need to fix before I can get my car inspected this month.  Lastly: DEAR WORK, I hate you for making me have a bad day. I hate you for having employees that suck at life. Why is it when I'm in training I manage to catch my trainer lying about important numbers causing him to probably get fired tomorrow morning which sucks because hes actually entertaining, find another employee lying about the time that he worked aka editting his time to get paid for time he's not even in the restaurant, hiring another moron as my equal who is probably getting paid more than me who cares more about catching people stealing than running the restaurant, and have people who are ahead of me who are soo not compitant to do their job which is as simple as filling out a form each night.. I can do this shit in my sleep yet they make more than me and fuck it up.         love always
