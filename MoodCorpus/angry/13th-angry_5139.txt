Part of my nightly assignment~~~
Tonight I will be delving into a little bit of my addiction/anger history. I had a lot to chew  over after therapy on Thursday. I haven't waded through all of the muck and the mire. But what I have figured out is I am broken. I have had some things happen in my life that I don't even want to begin to explain. They are dark and the only way I survived was to ride on the wave of my anger and self loathing. For years I went to therapy to get control of my hate, loathing, pity and anger. I tried to never forget that there was a broken monster in me constantly clawing at his box trying to get out. I have dual feeling around him. He kept me alive yet he keeps me from living. He has always been there just when I need him to fuck things up as usual. To prove to me that I am not worthy of compassion, success, happiness, laughter or love. He is there to take me back to that place of acting out of instinct to survive instead of listening to my heart and using the tools I have learned to keep him in his box. 
 
He is my DRUG....He is the VALIDATION that I have fucked up. He is what helps me continue ruining my life and that I am a "fuck up" and that nothing good is ever suppose to happen. Over the years I have come to realize that food, alcohol, and drugs are just a symptom to my true addiction..."ANGER". I really believe I get an emotional high from anger that nothing else has ever come close to. ( I think that is why I love make up sex soooo much) My anger feeds me in way that no other substance has ever provided. I strangely find comfort in the tapes my parental units planted so deeply in my head. Even though I so desperately want to change them and never hear them again. They are like that old friend you don't really like. They show up every once in a while uninvited to say hello, you want to try and trust them again and they end up reeking havoc in your life then leave you there to clean up the mess.
