I hate my life. I want to die. I hate everything about me. Why do I even write in this blog? No one doesn't listen to me. My mom is ALWAYS arguing with me. Mom always says to me "I expect more from you". Every damn day she has to put me down. WTF is wrong with her? Its not just her thats always upsetting me. Everybody is always making me sad or angry. I'm starting to think that everyone enjoys putting me down. I cut myself on saturday because of my mom making me depressed. I am starting to hate everyone I know because they dont understand me. I can not be myself around anyone. Im not normal and I dont think that I can ever be normal and I dont even know what being normal is. I dont really have any "friends". My whole fuckin life I've always been alone. Im afraid of being rejected and humiliated by people. I dont like going outside because of that fear. Im also very ugly and fat. I know people dont really like me. No one doesnt listen to me. I hate being in this world so much that I wish I was dead. I also can not be myself around my parents because they dont like me. I just want to make people like me. I want to please people. I dont want anyone to be disappointed in me. Life sux! Im so sick and tired of being someone Im not but no one doesnt like the real me. Everytime I do be myself, people dont like me anymore. I hate everything about me. People still dont like me. I dont know what to do anymore. I really want to give up on life. I want to die right now!  "im crying now" Everyone considers me a bitch. Im no good for anyone. I gonna cut myself now and no one cant stop me because they really dont give a damn!
