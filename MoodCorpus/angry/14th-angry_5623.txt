Dear Journal,
I haven't updated in ages. So what?

My god. I only update when I'm pissed off - and right now, I'm pissed off. At nothing in particular, just pissed off. Usually I would rant to my wonderfully great Hughbus (which reminds me, if you do think otherwise, go get fucked you fucked up people) but he is in bed, for he has uni tomorrow. *Burns quantem.*

I am sick, of everything actually. I hate school (^_^) and I hate everyone I know *not yoou simone! Hugh! :P* i know, because they are all losers, who seriously have no life. I can't wait to finish school so I can go get a life! School is fucked and losery! GOD SO ANNOYING, HATE EVERYONE! GOD. *RIPS HAIR OUT.*

Anyway, Hugh bought me bunnies and pajamas WITH bunnies on them for easter ^_^ although i do not HAVE THEM yet, for it is not yet easter. Now, I will update, and not do so again for a very long time, for livejournal users are losers. I just realised how fucked up it is to have a journal! *sarcastic slap in the face* What losers have these! Oh besides me.

Bye!
