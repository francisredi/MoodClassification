smelly
I'm angry about lots of things right now:
1. Lloyd
2. I haven't washed my hair in so long that I can't even remember the last time I did
3. Adam: He comes up to me and says, "Is your head so big that you can't walk through doors?" and I said, "What do you mean?" Adam said, "Do all of you Presidentials have such big heads that you can't get through doors?" and I said, "Why do you say that?". Adam says, "Your bio.". I think for a moment. In my bio, I listed lots of fun theatrical accomplishments of mine. I've worked on 9 shows this year, and this is one of the few times that I get a bio, so I want to take that opportunity to let my accomplishments be known. I don't think that makes me egotistical, I've just done a lot of thankless jobs this year and I'd like to have at least one opportunity to post something positive about myself. I tell this to Adam, and he still goes on and on about how arrogant all of the Presidentials are. I get really upset and mention how I haven't been cast in anything and all that I've done this year is menial crew work that people barely notice. In fact, I worked crew for his show and, of course, he never seemed to appreciate it. Doesn't that make him arrogant, not me? I couldn't really think of another good comeback because I felt like I was about to cry. I didn't want to sound weepy while tearing into him. I wonder if I should write him an angry message or just say something thouroughly bitchy to him the next time I see him. I'm just so pissed. I'm not arrogant..I mostly do these important yet overlooked crew jobs on shows, and he says I'm arrogant! Errrrrr..
4. I'm so behind on everything
5. I feel lonely right now.

Damnit...I know there was another thing I was really pissed about, but now I can't remember.
