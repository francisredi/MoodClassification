finally releasing sum anger
Hey kids!first of all, although its old news, i absolutly hate my father.i cant even believe that we(alledgedly)share a genetic link.he is the wolrlds biggest hippocrit whose absence as a parent has totally fucked me up.i rather not complain about my father, so now i will vent out sum other things that have been bothering me for a while.

This is a general statement to all those who have lied to me:
Although most likely anyone who is reading this has probabaly never lied to me,it will feel nice to finally let sum things be know.why the fuck do u find it necessary to lie to a person u alledgedly care about?i know the truth hurts, but it hurts more after being under the impression of sumthing entirely different.so stopped the charade,youll just make an ass of yourself.

And now ladies and gentlemen...a deep question:What do you think is your function is in your group of friends?and How important do you think you are to those around you?i have come to ponder these questions in the past year or two.wow i must sound really bitchy right now.but i do fell better now.

And one reiterated statement,i fucking hate my father
