So. I am in a terribly foul mood. Everything seems to be aggravating me today. Those stupid fucking workmen are back working on the house behind me, whats that a month now? Perhaps if they spent less time sitting around on their asses eating twinkies and more time actually working, I wouldn't be woken up by jack hammers, sanders and saws at 6 am every morning. I really want to jump that fence and aim that nail gun at all their heads.
On another note, I seemed to have pissed or upset my sister in someway, not sure exactly what I have done, but she has been real snippy at me every time I have seen her in the last 2 weeks. Maybe she is ragging or something. She goes through these little phases if I dont go and visit every 2nd day, I HATE HER. Mind you she has not come to my house in oh 6 months. Logical isn't she.
I really need to go to the dentist, I have a chip behind my 2 front teeth, that is getting bigger and really starting to annoy me. Thats what I get for listening to my stoner gf, when she says use a needle to get something that is stuck out of my teeth. * Makes note not to listen to any suggestions from her when she is high.
For days I have been feeling like I am forgetting to do something important. Don't you just hate that when you can't remember what it is. Anyway I feel better after my whine, ta ta.
