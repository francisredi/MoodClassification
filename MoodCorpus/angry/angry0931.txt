I hate myself
Am I really that terrible a person? I mean i love doing things for others, making people feel better, making people laugh and doing whateva i can to be there to make others' lives a little better, but damn it seems that like only one or two people understands that. I say this because yesterday my boyfriend left a message on my voice mail saying that he needs to talk to me because he's freinds had a little "conference" about me and told him to tell me that i ned to "calm dowm." Now i can understand that because sometimes i see the things i do and say the same thing to myself, but i don't know this time its different. I guess its because i thought that with Larry and his friends i can really be myself and let lose, but i guess i was wrong. And oh my was i pissed off. I mean reallllly fucking raging mad. I wasn't mad at Larry or any of his friends i was just mad at myself cuz i should have known better. I didn't want to talk to no body and i didn't want to be bothered but my mom kept telling my to do things around the house so my family was only making the situation worse. i didn't start feeling better until i took a nice hot bath with candles and listen to the Best of Roberta Flack CD...
