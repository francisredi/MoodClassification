I've found myself getting in bad moods and being pissed off with people lately. As much as I hate saying it, I think it's partly and maybe even fully because of my family. I feel like they just don't understand me. Yeah, my sisters can be like my best friends and I usually get along with my parents fine but they just don't know how I really feel about things. They joke around saying I'm depressed and suicidal and anorexic and stuff like that. But it really does make me upset. And when my mom talks about how I have an attitude or something that just makes me even more mad. They'll go on about it, making fun of my "attitude" and that just gets me pissed off. I can't really explain all this, which makes me angry because I had all my thoughts together just a few minutes ago. Arg. I don't know, I'm just so irritated right now. Sorry if I've been being like bitchy or something lately but I can't really explain all of this though I could like two seconds ago. Gahhhh. Whatever. I'm shutting up, you don't have to pay any attention to any of this. I'm a stupid kid and before I try to explain something I should actually get my thoughts together to make sense. Sorry kids. Peaceee.
