Grr....
Oh!! I just received distressing news! I am so angry now that my head hurts. =C

My boss just returned from a management meeting this morning with the news that no more casual wear is allowed in the office. That means no more jeans and tee-shirt! They are my staple clothes that I feel the most at ease with!!

See.. Everyone used to envy the freedom in my choice of clothes but look what happened now?! I know I shouldn't be ranting about it because it is normal to wear corporate wear to work and it was just that I had an advantage in the past.

I hate the new HR manager. She implemented so much changes and created so much problems ever since she came in. Grr... She was the one who brought up this dumb idea to the management in the first place!!

I will not take this lying down. I refused to conform! I will stage a rebellion. They want corporate wear?! Fine. I will show them that you can be sloppy in corporate wear and to be chic and stylish in jeans.

Die Die Die- all the people to support the idea. Especially that stupid HR manager and the Executive Director who implemented the idea. Ok. I am not that evil. Spare your life but I hope every corporate skirt you have will tear because of your big butts once you enter the office, every pants you wear wil be stained because your sat on something dirty, every shirt your will wear will be missing a button or two and every pair of heels you have break or covered in mud.
