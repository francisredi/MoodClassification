Guilt sets in
This morning was such a rush. C.H.U.A.N !!!!!!!!

Baby msg and called this morning a few times, not feeling too well. Needed me. But yet, i didnt hear a single thing. Only till much later (one hours thereabouts) then i finally managed to hear my phone, and boy was i shocked! Rushed out immediately without washing up to be with my baby. 

Thankfully nothing serious. Else i will blame myself if anything major happens! But baby was in such pain. Sigh. Each time baby cringe in pain, it just cut into my heart. There i was, helpless. At the same time, anger and guilt set through my mind. I should be here to comfort baby and accompany baby much much earlier. Not there to provide TLC to baby. Sorry baby!

Foul mood now. Though baby has forgiven me for missing the emergency calls and messages for help, i yet to forgive myself. Understand why baby is angry with me, so wont blame baby. But hey, am not even in a position to ask baby to forgive me after what i done.

Guess i need to vent my anger somewhere. Yeah. Maybe i should go for combat! Vent all my anger!
