ANGRY
I thought about friendslocking this, because you never know who might be reading, but then I thought wtf, I can complain if I want to.

Yesterday, dinner shift at HoM. I got there half an hour early to find the kitchen in a mess, dining halls not cleaned, coffee still downstairs and no one working, because they were having a meeting. And when the meeting finally ended everyone was supposed to have gone home hours ago so no one felt particularly like staying a little longer to help me clean everything up. Okay, I understand, they have to have meetings and work on the schedule and those things may be more imortant than doing the washing-up, but you'd think they could plan all those extra things in and maybe have more people working? Because I hate getting to work and having to take care of things the lunch staff are supposed to have done. Yesterday it was so much to do, and I was so angry my temples actually hurt. I would have broken down and cried for a bit had there only been time for it. 

Today I'm also having the dinner shift, but not by myself. Lisa will be there too. I am so not going there early again today to sort out everything that won't be done when I get there. 

Lie Detector: Yes you will.
Juice: *sigh* I know.

Despair not. There will be posts about other things than work. Eventually.
