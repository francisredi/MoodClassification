I can't believe Jun Planning replaced Majullae (Kangaroo girl) with Nann-ato (Genie-girl)! Argh! I'm so mad.

It's just not right. Nann-ato is pretty and all but it isn't fair to replace Majullae. I'd like Nann-ato a lot better if she'd just been a seperate release. So now I hate JP for replacing Majullae, and I hate Nann-ato for no good reason! So I hate JP even more for making me hate Nann-ato!

Hear that Jun Planning!? YOU SUCK!

There I feel better now. XD I wasn't planning to get Maju, honestly, but I may have considered it. Lots of people are disappointed and upset that she was cancelled. I think it's bad business practice. Beressa I can sorta understand because of the connotations of her uniform, but Maju had no real reason to be cancelled except she was unpopular and people liked to call her "fug". (She wasn't.) I don't think thats a good reason to cancel her. It's interesting Maju looked so much like Beressa too... so anyone that wanted Beressa had a chance in getting Maju for a similar pullip, till they cancelled Maju, too. Geez. Not Happy Jan.

Well I hope everyone that called her fug is happy. I'm not. >_<;

Well on other news I got my Oren today but she's kinda been over-shadowed by the fact I'm so mad at JP. XD Still she's lovely and I love her. Her hair was a bit frizzy at the ends (but then so was Panda's when I got her) so I gooped it up and it looks really pretty. Now I need a cute Gothi-Loli outfit for her! She's going to be my Gothic girl because it's so unsuited to her look. Because of this I'm not going to take pics till I can get a nice outfit for her somewhere...
