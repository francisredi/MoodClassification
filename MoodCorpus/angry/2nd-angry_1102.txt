i hate people
wanna know what i have so against drinking?

here's a great example:  it is now 2:10 in the morning, on a wednesday night.  oh, sorry, THURSDAY MORNING.  The room next to mine has two girls in it, one of which i know is a slut (i've heard it going on.  how gross), the other i'm not too sure about.  she seems nice enough to me.  these girls have decided to have a mini party w/like 4 guys.  they have beer in the room (RIT is a "dry" campus, and it's a really big deal when ppl have alcohol in the dorms), and now they have decided to play beer pong.  oh, did i mention the loud music w/the bass turned all the way up?

great

they have begun to sing along with the music.  badly.

because of them, it has taken me 2 hours to finish my simple sketchbook assignment, and now i am exhausted.  i now would like to go to sleep, seeing as i will not be getting any drawing done tonight.

i hate beer.

i hate those people so much.

i hate how i'm too much of a wimp to actually do anything about it.  they just intimidate me so much b/c i know they're drunk (or if they're not, they're "buzzed" or whatever the heck it is), and i don't feel like dealing with them at 2 in the morning.

i will now go to my friend's room and sleep on her floor.

i hope those people are having a great time.
