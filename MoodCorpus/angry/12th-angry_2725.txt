Book #9- Everyone Worth Knowing
Remember how I liked "The Devil Wears Prada" earlier this year?  Lauren Wesiberger's latest, Everyone Worth Knowing intrigued me because I had enjoyed her last book as a mindless distraction.  That was a huge mistake.

I'm assuming that Weisberger has the shortest memory in history, and her publisher also suffers from the same affliction.  "Everyone Worth Knowing" is the EXACT SAME BOOK as "The Devil Wears Prada"- all she did is change names and evil, soul sucking jobs and kept the format so predictably familiar that I was laughing half way through.  The name dropping is all there, and if you're really curious how shallow the "jet set" of New York are, this may hold your attention span for all of three seconds... but still, it's the SAME DAMN STORY, to a tee.  In fact, I bet a tonne of the dialogue is the same too.  Yes.  It's that bad.  I don't need to read another Weisberger book because I can tell you exactly what will happen.  I'm actually quite appalled by this to be honest.  HOW FUCKING UN CREATIVE ARE YOU WEISBERGER?  Thank god I only got this book from the library and didn't waste any actual money!  0/10.... what a waste!  It makes me sad to think of all the talented writers out there, with ORIGINAL IDEAS and this one is just a crappy remake of her last book.
