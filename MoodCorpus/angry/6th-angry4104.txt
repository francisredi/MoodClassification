Never anger a pirate, esp. a woman pirate
I am upset. I am angry at the way my friend is being treated. I almost jumped in my car last night and drove who knows how many hours to kick someone's ass that I don't even know.  Friends are family to me, and no one messes with my family.  

I think that girls should be treated like the princesses they are, no questions asked.  That doesn't mean being spoiled, but being taken care of and loved and cherished and treated as though they are the only ones. That rarely happens any more, if it ever really did.  Maybe I was the only girl that grew up believing she was a princess, and was treated that way.  We should be treated in such a way that we believe it ourselves.  When someone goes against that and wrongs my family (remember--friends are my family), I get so angry that tact and demure (if I have any of that left) fly out the window.  I practically shake with anger and disgust.

She is not the only member of my family to be treated this way. I'm thinking of taking a day off work and kicking certain people in their dense heads with steel-toed boots. Rrrr.
