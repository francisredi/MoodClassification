Irish Luck
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am angry today.&nbsp; I've been grudging with someone I care about for the last couple days,&nbsp;it's one of those that leaves you wondering if your friendship&nbsp;ended with the last thing said.&nbsp; If that stress wasn't enough, last night I woke up to what I thought was Jorjia farting.&nbsp; For a cute little black dog, she can peel the paint sometimes.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turns out, as I was walking out the door this morning. She had an accident in the living room.&nbsp; Not just any accident.&nbsp; A lump of gray, that was apparently so caustic that it left a dark stain on the floor.&nbsp; Now here's my Irish luck.&nbsp; It's not a cool stain.&nbsp; it's not shaped like Elvis, the Virgin Mary, Larry Harvey or even George Bush.&nbsp; (There's more than could be said on that last one, but I'll spare my republican friends)&nbsp; It's just a dark brown, liver shaped stain on my hardwood floors.&nbsp; That in order to remove I will have to re-finish/replace my hardwood floors.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though she was out for a while last night, I can't get mad.&nbsp; This wasn't her acting out.&nbsp; It looks like she's not feeling well.&nbsp; So she must have eaten something.&nbsp; It would explain her mellow, needy moods lately.&nbsp; So, I can't get mad, or anything.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, that's pretty much left me in a grumpy mood to start, and I don't see it getting any better as the day&nbsp;rambles on.&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving my fuse for bullshit, pretty short.&nbsp; So you know&nbsp;keep that in mind, if&nbsp;you interact with me today and find me a&nbsp;touch difficult to deal with.
