Poison Me Slowly
I hate....I HATE. Having roommates. I wake up to the sound of like, five million people in our apartment, and they're all discussing passing around the alcohol. 

Now, I made it clear at the beginning of the year that I would not, under any circumstances, allow alcohol in our apartment. Not only is it against university rules to have even alcohol containers on campus, but it's against state and FEDERAL LAW for people under 21 to drink. As the only the legal adult in this room, I would be the one to get in the most trouble if campus security came a-knocking on our door. University policy directly states that if there is something illegal going on in a room, and the other occupants know about it, EVERYONE gets in trouble. I gave Sarah an hour to get the alcohol and every single trace of it out of the apartment, or I would call campus security on them. I have no hesitance in doing so, as I'm not about to risk my credibility at this university for the likes of THEM. 

Sarah then got mad at me for "following every rule in existence" and that this was "her apartment too." I don't care if she has people over. I really don't. But alcohol is something I absolutely will NOT tolerate. It will be gone, and it will never come back, so help me God I will bring the police down on them in a heartbeat. I'm sorry. I feel extremely strongly about underage drinking, and I will not have it in this apartment. I don't care if they go elsewhere to do it. Not here, not ever. 

I'm sick of being the only responsible person here.
