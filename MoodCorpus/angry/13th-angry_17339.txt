Dear Fundies: Shut-Up.
So I was just looking through my first google hit of 'War on Christianity' and I come up with THIS shit:

Possibly the most sinister battlefield in the war on Christianity takes place in the classroom. The Ten Commandments have been prohibited on school bulletin boards and most forms of prayer have been declared unconstitutional in the nation's schools, even that which is student initiated.

Atheists and others who hate God despises Christians who help others come to a saving knowledge of Christ. They are determined to battle those who would help immature Christians -- particularly Christian children -- grow in their relationship with Jesus Christ.

Not only does this guy's grammar reflect his intelligence, but this is just total bullshit. The reason you can't post the Ten Commandments in a school classroom is because there is a SEPARATION BETWEEN FUCKING CHURCH AND STATE!!!!! You can't post the Ten Commandments because NO religious doctrines or scriptures are posted in school! Where are the muslims asking why copies of the Koran aren't included in school Libraries? Or the legions of Jews demanding everyone wear a Yamaka?

"Athiests and others who hate God"? Athiests don't HATE God, you fuckers: they don't BELIEVE in fucking God! That's like saying I hate Leprichauns, Bigfoot and Hope for Humanity! And these "Athiests... despises"? Listen, fella; here's a novel idea: use your fucking grammar check. 

Also, I must touch on the opening of this passgae: "Most sinister battlefield in the war on Christiany" is in the classrooms. The classrooms where everyone is treated equally, where everone is taught to respect others, work together, and contribute to a mutually beneficial, pro-social, constructive environment of enrichment and education. This is the most sinister battlefield. Well, if THAT'S you're most sinister battlefield, buddy, YOU DON'T HAVE MUCH OF A GODDAMN WAR, DO YOU?!

Ah... now I feel better.
