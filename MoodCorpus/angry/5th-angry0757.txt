Now I remember why i hate stuck up bitches!!!!!
You know i love my friends dearly and well i would do anything for them. But then they just go and be ignorant like they have a fucking chip on their shoulder and that they are better then everyone else. I would just like to tell them what i really thought of them without them saying a damn word. They are so fucking opinionated the second they hear you say something they don't like they fight it like babies. But they act like they are the shit. Well i got news for them. What really put the icing on the cake was that we got lectured as a class about things we need to improve and do better and they got up and left right after he was done. While he was talking they had their headphones on. No one is that good that they have to be like that. I don't care how young or old they are. I am actually so mad right now i can't even eat. That is a first! But i really and aggitated about this whole thing. I would like to give them leway and say oh yeah forget about it. But unfourtunately i can't because this isn't the first time anything like this has happened. And if i go the rest of the school time without talking to anyone i will. But i'll be damned if i let them continue to act like that and me still call them friends. God damn! 

Now that i got that off my chest i'm going to class now. So i can learn something.
