Blah
I'm in such a grumpy mood. I have to go to my stupid group meeting this afternoon.. ALL afternoon. So I have to leave in like an hour and a half and I just woke up. I still feel like I need to start my other essay too. I'm also annoyed at Chris. Don't ask me why. I just am. I have to go spend 6 hours of my life sitting in SITE working on this irritating project. I hope we at least finish it. I should volunteer to present it, because I seriously feel like I did relatively little on the first part of the project. Oh well, it was only worth 5%. 

I'm supposed to go to Chris' tonight. But I don't want to now because he never bothered to tell me he was going into work early this morning so i had to phone his house thinking his cell phone was off for some reason and I had to talk to his stupid annoying sister. Excuse me, Chris? Tell your sister you're going to work early and not me? not cool. If you were here i'd have to resist the urge to bite you. Hard. And you've put me in a sufficient enough bad mood to make me want to go all the way to fucking carlingwood library and yell at you. Well not yell, but give you the evil eye at least. PHONES SHOULDN'T BE OFF. THEY SHOULD BE ON VIBRATE. FUCK. See, I have no rational reason to be mad at you, but one stupid thing can PISS ME OFF. Not to mention you didn't answer my calls OR call me back last night. Fuck that. Don't fucking fuck with my fucking head. Or i get angry. I'M ANGRY. CAN YOU TELL?
