i wish i knew what was wrong. i just feel really crappy and i dont know why. i am in a horrible mood. all i want to do is sleep and i have no motivation to do anything. nothing is funny anymore the past couple days. there is just something off and i wish i could fix it i hate feeling like this. i am saying what i am mad about over little things that bother me that i wouldnt normally say cuz i know it would cause problems, but still it has bothered me so i say it. i just feel like nobody cares. i feel like i am stuck inside a box and cant get out. i just want to know what is wrong and why i feel like this.
it is days like these when i realize how few friends i actually have. when there is nowhere to go and nothing to do with nobody. yeah i went to lunch but it wasnt the same as always and it wasnt with my friends, they are bob's. he acts like he wants to be with amiee more then he does with me. and he didnt even really talk to me while we were there. and i told him that him always picking her over me bothered me and he got all mad. but i never really get mad at him he is the one always mad at me. i dont know. 
i wish i could figure out why i feel so bad and be happy again.
