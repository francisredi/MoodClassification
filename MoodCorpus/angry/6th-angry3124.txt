Arg!
I hate school sponsored social functions.  I hate the pressure.  I hate the mendacity.
The last thing I want to do on a Saturday night is banter with people I already have to see every gd day.  People with whom the only thing I have in common is a profession, particularly a profession where the reasons for doing it range from the intellectual, the greedy, the pompous and the humanitarian.  
You wanna know what I really want to do this coming Saturday night?  Go have a beer and dose of surreality at the Horseshoe.  Not get dressed up and have people ask me why I'm not eating the food.  Not have my feet hurt from wearing ridiculous shoes.
But does this matter?  No.  Because I've left my comforting bubble of like-minded individuals who also think that things like Winter Ball are crap and entered a world of people who think it's the best thing ever.  I mean, who wouldn't want to maybe see a professor get drunk and dance?  Who wouldn't want to play the "Who's the hotttest in our class?" game?  Who wouldn't want to get wasted all the while benefitting the Alzheimer's association?  And who wouldn't want to give a professor free shots?

Oh wait, I wouldn't.
