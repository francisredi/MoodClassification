Pissed really
Yeah ok... so well yesterday sucked! I went out with Hannah and Cece. That wasn't really the bad part. The sucky part was that not only did Hannah decided to big the biggest pain in the ass by being compleatly high she decided it would be a great idea to tell me that not only did Chris (my ex) get high while we were together he was high everytime he came to see me. The one thing I asked him not to do he did every single time he saw me.  What he couldn't be around me unless he was high??!!! WTF!!!!! So through out dinner I have to pretend that I'm not screaming on the inside with anger and unbleavible rage. I really should have gotten a fucking acadamy award for that performance. I mean really.  Not only was I shacking with rage, I sat there and listend to her tell me that he used to talk about me all the time and that he was obsessed with me. Oh then to make the night just perfect... Cece confirms that yes indead Chris and Hannah had sex with each other.  I kinda find it sad that Hannah has to take up my left overs. The past what 2 boyfriends that I broke up with she has decided to shack up with.  So Cece drove me back to the hotel... because I am staying there because of Con.  So anyway Cece drove me back to the hotel where as soon as I found Becca I start crying like crazy, scream and cuss my brain out and then fall to the floor in such a wave of sadness.  He lied to me. He played me. He made me look like a compleat fool.  I thought of him as my best friend, my confedont, and all that wonderfull stuff.  Then I find out this.  I asked him not to get high around me because this one time he turned mean.  On a good note... there are hot guys here at the Con. I do believe I will back out of going to the park tonight with these liers and bitches and stay here and flirt.  teehee.  Well I need to go play with these wonderfull people. I hate Hannah and Chris. Can't decide on Cece
