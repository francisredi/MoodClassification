Nao angry. NAO SMASH.

Okay. Anyone on my list still remember my old Enzan/Netto fic, Reunion? Yes? No? Well, doesn't matter. I was poking around AFF.net in the hopes of thinking up a good plotline to start Kizuato (my rewrite of Reunion) as well as a lack or anything better to do, and being the masochistically curious little thing I am, I clicked to what promised to be a really bad fic and read it. All fourteen chapters of it.

Guess what I ran across in chapter 13?

SOMEONE FUCKING RIPPED OFF THE EXACT SITUATION I USED TO GET ENZAN AND NETTO TOGETHER IN CHAPTER 2 OF REUNION. ALMOST THE EXACT SAME GODDAMNED WORDING AND ALL.

I am SO fucking pissed off right now. Not only did they have the balls to rip off the one fic I have always considered my best, they didn't even bother changing the fucking wording of the scene enough to matter. I mean, hell, if they really felt the need to plagiarize me, they could have at least tried to make the scene different enough that I wouldn't have recognized it! So I am in a full-blown twinnish rage, quite understandably, I think. I am, however, being nice and refraining from flaming this author's ass into the next millennium, if only because AFF's disabled a lot of their features in preparation for their server move. (That is the only thing saving that dipshit's ass, I tell you.) Rar.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to get started on Kizuato. Maybe writing will help me work off my rage.
