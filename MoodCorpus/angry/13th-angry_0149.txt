WTF, Dominican Republic?

Apparently it is opposite day in the WBC; A-Rod actually came through when it counted, and the DR offense has been silent. It is bizzare.

On the other hand - BASEBALL OMG YAY. We've been watching some Red Sox ST through our online cable package (CJ hooks his laptop up to the teevee, the picture quality makes the games feel like fake footage from an 80's baseball movie), which has been cool. Except that all the games are on at 10am, so I haven't had my annual first-game-of-the-year hot dog. If I had been clever, this morning I could have wrapped my chicken and apple sausage in a piece of cinnamon raisin French toast (homemade bread and everything; CJ really needs a job) to watch the game. But alas, that thought only occurred to me just now.

I went to the (Berger) lab this morning to 'run a gel' and ended up staying for five hours to strip, recharge and equilibrate six Ni columns. Yay weekends? Tomorrow I will be spending alllll day in the cold room doing purifications which may or may not work - the gel I ran was of pre- and post-induction cells and they didn't induce nearly as well as my test inductions the other day did. And then Tuesday and Wednesday will be long lab days as well. Grumble.

Unngh, Boys and Girls Club commercial. I HATE YOU A-ROD. HATE HATE HATE. Incidentally, today marked the first time this year that I flipped off the TV (A-Rod and Johnny Damon sulking together in the dugout. I'm sure I'll see that same exact frame at least twelve more times before October).
