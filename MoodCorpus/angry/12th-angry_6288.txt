Flowing like a babbling brook.
So the trees are starting to have buds on them.  Always a beautiful sight in Oklahoma.  Within the next couple of the weeks the redbuds will be flowering as well.  In another month, the Azaleas will be amazing us with all their glory.

That's if there isn't an ice storm before then that completely debilitates the state and knocks electricity for a month.  No I'm not joking.  That is Oklahoma weather for you.  We were on tornado watch all day and the storms they are a brewing.

I've had a couple of conversations with friends here lately that once again have me feeling like I just need to get out of this state.  The only things keeping me here is my job and my friends...and the majority of my friends are in Tulsa.  Yeah, so.  I wanna move.  Each day here just confirms it for me more.  

I hate the rednecks.
I hate that there are few to no femmes here.
I hate the blazing heat in the summer and the ice storms in the winter
I want some decent entertainment.
I want options, choices.

I'm grumpy in case you hadn't noticed.
