maybe this early COMMUNIST thing isnt what i wanted.
my school is ruled by communists. i hate it. theyre FORCING me to take spanish.

first of all, SPANISH IS THE DUMBEST LANGUAGE ___EVER____ CREATED. it would be alright if i could take japanese, or maybe even russian, but no, our principal shut down all language classes except for spanish to early college students. our principal saying something promising to us in our freshman year and then going back on her promise is a perfect definition of propaganda. now, if i want to avoid spanish and take japanese, im gonna have to pay 100-200 dollars to actually pay for the classes, and we were promised a free education. basically, we were fed lies all throughout our freshman year to get us to stay, and now the principal takes everything away that made this crappy program worthwhile. im starting to see why hilary left.



today in spanish class, i considered walking up to my spanish professor and saying "im sorry, i dont understand your devil speak." but that mightve hurt my chances to take japanese so i refrained myself.

and if i stay in spanish, ill fail. i cant roll my r's

devil speak.
