TMI Public Service Announcement- like ya'll wanna know more about my life, right?
Letter to myself-  as seen done by the wildly famous geekwriter!

Dear Myself,

Don't wait a month before taking care of second degree burns. They just get infected and then start to develop gangrene. Don't think that it will just heal, even if the others haven't ever gotten this bad. When you remove the dead, black skin and pour alcohol on the infected part and don't feel anything- that time is a bit too late to review your nursing techniques. 

Also, don't get pissed off becuase your parents never told you something very important, like, say- they only got married because your mother would have been fired from her job for violation of the morals clause had you been born out of wedlock. Don't be upset that the little clause and one asshole of a boss are the reasons that your mother stayed with a man who didn't get that "Stop, you're hurting me" is NOT cause to throw your son against a wall just becuase five year olds don't know enough not to beg for simple things, like nonviolent parents. Don't be angry that your father told your brother and not you, knowing that your little brother has /no/ concept of TACT. Don't be angry that James decided this was perfect information to tell you while you were eating dinner with a friend at IHOP. 

Most importantly, DON'T BE ANGRY AT YOUR MOM FOR NOT DENYING IT IN FRONT OF YOUR BEST FRIEND. 

That is all.

Sincerely,
Sarah 

PS- who thinks I do too many angsty, TMI posts?
