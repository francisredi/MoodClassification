Doorstaff are whores
Tomorrow, I'm gonna spend as much time as possible phoning people to complain about doorstaff.  To start with, there was a fight on the dance floor and a couple of friends of mine got pushed outside because they were between the fight and the fire escape, so I complained to the door staff who spouted a load of shit about them starting a fight or something, and you can't really argue when its four doorstaff against you, and then I asked the bouncer on the way out if there was a number I could call to complain, at which point I was told to go fuck myself, I told the bouncer to fuck off and walked out, but I'm really not gonna be told to go fuck myself by a fucking boucner, so I'm gonna spend tomorrow complaining to the manager, whoever on the council is in charge of door staff, and whoever else I can think of, especially after a friend of mine ended up with bruises because she was standing between the doorstaff and the fire escape.  Fucking cunts.  Might complain to the uni as well.  I'm really not gonna be told to fuck myself by a load of dumbass shits like that. I honestly can't express how much I'm pissed off by those fucking cunts.  Might complain to the student union president and try and get the bouncer who caused half the hassle banned from the SU, seeing as he seems to spend quite a bit of time there.  Fucking short arses trying to fucking compensate. Fucking cunts.  God, I'm gonna have a good day tomorrow.  Fucking whores.
