Frustration
Ok maybe I shouldn't be saying this where everyone can see it, but I have to vent somehow. I am so darn frustrated cause a certain person won't call me, or talk to me on the computer at all. Last night was the first time I heard from this person Since Monday. Once I heard from them I felt a lot better. However, in that conversation they said they would talk me today. Well some how I knew that wouldn't happen because that is the way it always happens. They say, "I will talk to you tomorrow.' and it ends up I don't hear from them at all. It's aggravating, and frustrating. The frustration just builds every passing moment too. I don't know what to do. I feel lost, cause I have know idea how the heck to talk to this person with out starting a fight, or coming off selfishly. See that is the other thing. I feel like I am being selfish about the whole thing. I feel like I am wrong to feel this way. But I hear all the time what this person is doing, or saying from other people. It's like they talk to others more than they do me, and I end up hearing about it from those people. I don't know whether I should be angry at myself for being selfish, or angry at this person because I feel so ignored and left out. What do I do? God please help me.
