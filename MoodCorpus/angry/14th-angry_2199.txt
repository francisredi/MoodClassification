Attack Of The Ants - Not a DvD Review...
Every Spring we have an issue with Ants. The more it rains, the more of them decide our condo is a great place to look for food and shelter. Considering this season of rain has broken a few records, you do the math. 
So far this week either me or Paco has had to spray at least twice a day. My room has been hit several times, the kitchen is under constant assault and we even had to clean the rattie cage because the ants found their treats!
I hate it. No so much because of the ants, I mean they are pretty much harmless. But the constant smell of RAID and the constant being on the out look for a line of the little fuckers is what gets me. Everything you do is "Will this attract ants?"

I did wake up late today. I remember at least two coughing fits last night (or this morning, whichever). The one this morning had me freaked cuz I couldn't catch my breath and couldn't stop coughing. It's a bit of a pisser to wake up from a dead sleep and don't have the ability to breath. The bedroom door was closed which means Paco hadn't left for work yet but I don't know if he came in to see about me or not, I fell right back into my coma once I could breathe again. I hate being sick. I mean like as much hate as I have for stupid drivers kind of hatred. This one seems to be all in the throat, so there is a lot of coughing. And I am a smoker. And a pot head. So yeah this is a fucking JOY.....
