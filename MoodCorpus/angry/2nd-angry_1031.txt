Us, The Cossacks of Shamyl
I find it horribly rediculous that the the united states did nothing and still hasn't even acknowledged the fact that over the course of 3 years 250,000 adults and 40,000 children were slaughter by the russians from 1994-1997. i mean honest fox national news congradufuckilations 300,000 over 30 years(i dont mean to say 300,000 lifes were in significant, or insensitive but chechnya has it worse by far. at least they were burried as apposed to taking shovels much like show and plowing body parts into the street to let them rot.No time or resources to bury the dead gasoline used as firewalls to prevent russian advances.).. as long as it doesn't happen to an ally its a bad thing. united states does not acknowledge genocide as long as its done by an ally isreal to palestine, russia to chechnya, sudan to the common wealth. I'd personally much rather watch my family of die over the course of 30 years as to 30minutes.Grozny ran red. blame your self america for the hate against you. acknowlegde before you judge you fucking ignorant retards.


teachers "they hate us for what america stands for"
Response: No, its for being complete ignorant bastards that never acknowledge or respond to genocide unless it gives america an advantage.

You cant cry hate when you refuse to understand a situation which you have created your self.

Governmentment officials "We can never prevent terrorism"
Response: True,but doing the right thing wouldn't hurt.
