why should i care when nobody else does?
so im not really sure whats been on my mind lately but its been alot of things. i tend to be a very depressed angry person, and i really dont like being that way. i hate it when people dont listen and dont care about my feelings i hate how nobody ever listens when i try to give sugestions i hate how i am always lonely. it truly seems like nobody cares for anything i say or do. i have had alot of things on my mind lately and i havent ever really been able to tell anyone about it cuz nobody seems like they want to listen. i tend to feel like i want to shut myself off from the world and not pay any attention to thos around me so i dont have to feel the way that i do. i have def been taking that thought however into huge consideration why should i care when nobody else does? but yea. thats i i feel and i dont think anyone can chage it. i try and see if people can consider my feelings but they blow me off and think its sooo funny well&nbsp; Guess what? it really hurts me and i dont know how much more of this i can take. everyone aroung me makes me feel sooo self concious. it sucks i cant get a boyfriend and it sucks that i hate the way i look, but nobody seems to care when they are with their boyfriends and i am alone in the corner thinking of ways to block everyone out.
