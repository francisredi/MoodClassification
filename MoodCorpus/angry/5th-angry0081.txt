GRR
GRR!! I'm angry about this whole cell phone thing. I lost all my numbers, all my messages, had to record a new  voice mail and without any warning. This sicko with a 425 area code number had been harassing me for two months. I told my mom about it for the first time today. She told me dad who immediately decided he was going to change my number. I'm on a family plan with my parents and my sister, but I pay for my own cell phone. So the first thing I hear about him wanting to change my number is my father coming into my bedroom (without knocking) telling me he cancelled my cell phone and giving me my new number. Switching phone numbers was aggravating a couple of months ago, but now I am just angry. GRR!! I don't know if I'm angry at the stalker sicko, angry at my father (I know he was just trying to protect me and his name is the one on the bill, etc, but he could have asked my opinion since I pay for it, he could have let me choose my new number). Ugh. Anyway, I'm just GRR. Someone call me at my new number 852-4401 and cheer me up.
