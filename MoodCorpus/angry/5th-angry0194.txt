STOP HATE!
I just went to see brokeback mountain.  the aftermath was like going through a breakup over the course of 10 minutes.  first i was sad because the movie was sad, then i was depressed because it was the second story where people couldn't be together even though they loved each other.  now i'm angry.  angry because they had to be afraid of what was good and natural.  afraid becuase of hate.  and maybe a little religion.  hate is wrong.  more wrong than homosexuality or mixed race relationships or disabilities will ever be!  understanding is what we all need.  and love.  or at least peace.  it's out of the question to ask for a utopia where every one loves everyone else and we all live in perfect harmony, but realistically, can't we all just get along?  can't we at least make a little effort accept what we don't understand/don't believe?  in the words of some long gone peace rally, give peace a chance.

now about religion--i understand that your convictions are not mine and i accept that.  that doesn't mean i'm going to be another, holier person around you because let's face it, i'm no fucking puritan.  and i don't expect you to give into my temptations.  i also don't expect you to make any effort to convert me to believing what you do.  i'm perfectly happy as i am.  be who you are, i'll be who i am and if you can't deal with it, move the fuck on. thank you.

so in the case of all the excuses people come up with for committing hate crimes, the only excuse is that they are dumb shits.  dumb shits that don't give a damn about themselves or anyone else.  proudly insecure bastards running to mommy or jesus or mr. lawyer to justify the fact that they are ashamed of themselves.  you're just digging your own grave deeper and deeper, all the way to hell, assuming such a place exists.

that is all.  thank you for your time.
