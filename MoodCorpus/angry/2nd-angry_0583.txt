Cronulla
Ok, so I don't want to rant big about this, but it seriously makes me sick to my stomach.

I was probably more than naive to assume that this kind of public and violent discrimination couldn't occur in Australia. I was so very wrong. I nearly cried when I saw those ignorant drunk men wrapping themselves in an Australian flag and screaming out Waltzing Matilda, then loudly and disgustingly proudly spitting out their words of hate against those they called "Wogs" and "Lebs". How dare they have so little respect for another human life that they would consider themselves above anyone who looks different or practices a different religion or follows a different culture.

There was a man on the news who was wearing a t-shirt that he had written on. His slogan was "Ethnic Cleansing Unit", and then I watched him drape himself in an Australian flag, just like someone who had Aussie pride would do at a sporting match. There were men chasing down anyone with dark hair and dark skin. I saw them trip a man who was fleeing for his life, and then they began to kick him and hit him while he lay helpless on the ground. A brave Policeman jumped right into the fray wielding pepper spray. He distracted the attackers just long enough to pull the victim to his feet and shield him as they ran to his police car. These same offenders were shown on camera later, angry that they had been sprayed with pepper spray, and arguing that the cop was in the wrong. I don't think so. Idiots chased down an Ambulance - which was there for the sole reason of assisting the injured, pelting it with bottles and rocks. The windows were smashed but that didn't deter them - they still ran after it screaming obscenities.

One man was on the news yelling that they just "wanted to take their beach back for the aussies". Well then, piss off and hand it back to the Aboriginals. No? Well then learn to share, prick.
