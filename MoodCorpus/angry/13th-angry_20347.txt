i really dont need this.
not now at least. wait a fucking week. please. you know what? yeah, ill be the first person to admit im selfish. i know that. you do too. but when did everyone start listening to me? seriously. i dont own you. why should you do what i want you to do? yeah, ill probably be mad at the moment if i dont get my way, but ill get over it. why does everyone need to take my feelings in consideration over their own? and how the hell am i supposed to predict the future. you didnt have to stay. god, quit being such a baby. maybe if people would fucking explain things to me when theyre happening, i would understand. no, why tell me anything? this is such bullshit. im so sick of this trivial highschool crap. if you wanna say something to me, come to me. we can talk it out, or whatever. if youre just gonna act like a little puss &amp; hide, thats fine with me.&nbsp;ugh. i cant even wait to get the hell away from here, meet new people, new stuff to do, new everything. i cant wait. in the past week, ive gotten in 2 fist fights with my brother. hes such a loser. he thinks hes this big giant badass, but, to me he'll always be 5. im having a lot of problems with everything, and i currently have nobody to talk to about them. because everyone is ethier not talking to me, wouldnt care, or is never there.im getting stress pimples, all over...please, someone kill me.i hate this. and i hate everyone. i just want this to end. now.
