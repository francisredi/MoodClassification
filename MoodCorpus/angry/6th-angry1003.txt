Pissed
We(me, and Whitcomb) just got back from her friends house. I am so freakin pissed off because Sandi had asked why could I lay on whitcomb and she can't and whitcomb said because shes related to me and then she said kinda in a way. That made me so mad because she might not think of me as a "sister" but I think of her as one, even though we're just "half sisters" I still love her like I love my "whole sisters". Then she had the nerve to ask me if I was mad at her. Of course I am mad he wouldn't be mad, and she even knows that I don't like her saying things like that. Anyway... then one of her friends said that I was "BIG", which means she was calling me FAT! BIG is just a nice word for FAT! That pissed me off because Whitcomb didn't even say anything about it. Then I had got up to go to the bathroom(I was laying with Whitcom) and when I came back her friend was laying with her, she took my spot. I had to go sit by my self in a strange persons house. Whitcomb didn't even ask if I still wanted to sit there. Whatever... I am going to bed. GOODNIGHT!
