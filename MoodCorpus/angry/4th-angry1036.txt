okay, i knwo this is my first post, but uinfortunate to say it isn't going to be a very chipper post...

i just can not understand people and their issues. If someone doesn't like having their pictures taken why do people insist on having a billion pictures of that person.  Don't you ever think maybe they don't want to be remembered in pictures because their pictures almost always turn out horrible.  I hate pictures, i dispise (spelling) them, i HATE my pictures being taken, it makes me feel like shit - espacially when i look at the prints or the pictures on the computer.  

Tonigh when i got home I thought i'd get all the awesom pictures i have of andrew off the camera before something happens to them, as in being deleted, but how i did so...arg.... i saw so many horrible pcitures of me, i just felt like crying, I HATE PICTURES, like honestly if i don't like them why can't people respect that and stop taking pictures.  Like any other time if someone says no, just don't take pcitures okay, it's not that hard to understand..... man pictures just suck........ :'(

i'm out, so tired i'm off to pretty much watch some tv, maybe let myself cry a lil bit
night everyone, and happy new years
