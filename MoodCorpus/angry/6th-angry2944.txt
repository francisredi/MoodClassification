Okay I have made all of my entries (except this one) so that only my friends and I can read them because my fucking nosy mom went onto my myspace, found the link to my livejournal, and read ALL of it. SHE IS NOT SUPPOSED TO READ MY JOURNAL! IT IS PRIVATE! IF I WANTED HER TO READ IT I WOULD HAVE E-MAILED HER THE LINK! She wasn't happy about it either because a lot of the entries have cussing and stuff like "I HATE MY LIFE!" and "I HATE MY MOM!" Well, I don't think too many say that I hate my mom, but it's true, and I actually HOPE she is reading this so she knows that I do, in fact, hate her, and so she knows that she ruined my self-esteem, not to mention my LIFE! I honestly don't care what she says or does when she reads this either. She can go to hell for all I care. I know this is a little drastic for her just reading my journal, but this explosion has been building up for a LONG time.

Anyway, I will write all of my other thoughts, feelings, and events of the day in a more private setting from now on. Knowing her, she will get her oh-so-perfect (or in my opinion, her sugar daddy, because it seems like she only married him for money) Jim to find some kind of computer program so she can butt into my life once again. I'm so tired of her shit!

Update again in a minute because I don't feel like having my privacy invaded further!
