I'm so sick of Safeway, it makes me sick. I hate kids, I hate old people, I hate morbidly obese toads that can't even truck themselves around a grocery store, I hate babies, I hate families, I hate rednecks, I hate rich people, I hate middle class, bourgeois half heads who like to overspend with thier credit cards and slap "Support Our Troops" magnets on the back of thier gas-guzzling SUVs and I hate catering to these people. I hate dickhead arrogant assistant managers cough*Javier*cough, I hate dumbass 40 year old, white district department managers who try to talk like Dr. Dre and can't remember my name cough*Teri*cough and I hate kissing both thier asses. I hate being under constant anonymous supervision by mystery shoppers, auditors and health department officials and I HATE alternative rock music. F U C K  S A F E W A Y! But the kicker is the fact that they won't allow me to pierce my face. BULLSHIT! I'm quitting. 

I need to stop smoking weed because I'm becoming irritable when I'm sober.
