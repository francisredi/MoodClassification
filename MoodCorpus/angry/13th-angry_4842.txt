*bangs head on desk* Damn the bad luck!
Im really starting to hate havin constant appointments. Soon Ill have to go to the doc for a pshyc/nuerosomethinghavingtodowiththebrain test. I HATE those! They always ask the stupidest questions. Im NOT nuts! They really should stop testing me for somesort of brain shit. I mean yea I was diagnosed with depression last year and the meds they gave me worked for about two weeks, then stopped. So I just stopped refiling the prescription. I think Ive done good on the depression stuff, yea I make a few "help me I need to talk to someone" posts but thats how I deal with things. Talkin about it. I hate talking to counselors too. Last time I was ordered to by the damn Oklahoma court system *which is a friggin JOKE* they sent me and my sis to this woman. Cause they thought we had emotional problems cause our parents got divorced, yea we had a lil bit I wont lie and say we didnt. But you show me a perfectly stable child that at eight years old saw her father try to kill her mother with a sleeping bag cord and Ill fully say I was nuts. This woman asked us one of the times we went "If you had a magic wand what would you change about your life?" WTF kinda question is that?? Thats just stupid! Fuck, dont wanna go to the brain doctor!!!
