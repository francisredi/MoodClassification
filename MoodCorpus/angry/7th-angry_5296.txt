Failure...
I am so mad at myself! Well I hate playing the saxophone. I don't think people realize this. If I could go back in time, I probably wouldn't be in band. Honestly. Yeah it has it's fun times like the drum major part...but otherwise no. I have been planning for a few weeks now to quit my saxophone lessons and last week I attempted to tell him but I didn't have the courage. So, on my way there I had a speech all planned out and everything for what I was going to tell him. I got to the end of the lesson (when I was going to drop the bomb) and the chance came up! I opened my mouth to start saying something and the chance left in an instant. SOOO I get into the car and basically explode in anger on my dad who really had no clue about the whole ordeal...and he just listened for a while and sided with me that my mother should call him and cancel. Well last week my mother refused to cancel my lesson for me. She said: " If you want to quit so badly, then you get to tell him - not me" Well I can't be mean to a nice person. I really like the guy and I can't just be like "Oh and by the way...You won't be seein me for a while!" mmmmm.........this is very difficult. My excuese is very good too - I just don't have any time to practice! AT ALL. NONE! Softball and softball conditioning takes up parts of Monday, Wednesday, thursday, and Friday. Wednesday I also have guitar lessons (which are way more fun than saxophone!) and If I'm not doing any of those things, I'm doing homework (every single day!). On top of that, I try really hard to hang out with my friends so that everyone is peachy happy. Ugh this whole thing is just pissing me off! I wanna quit soo bad!
