if you love me, then leave me
Man i frikkin' love livejournal so i can take my anger out here and no one will know. FUCKING bad sleep last night. around twelve in the morning, mom started talking on the phone again, and i was sleeping and what do i hear? her talking about me. no not the good way, the bad one. first thing i hear when i kind-off wake-up? "she's just like her father," yeah, i know i am. i just don't need to be told all the frikkin' time now!! if you hate me, then let me be, if you love me, let me go and live somewhere else. getting so vexxed off these family issues now, this is the worst so far, also feeling used. used, for the shit i have. this is such BULLshit! man i can't wait 'till i'm out of here or done w/this life. i really want to know, "what's the purpose of life," well mine. if i'm here to be hated, treated bad, then fine. i'll let it be. it's destiny isn't it? i hate you, i despise you. i can't believe i live here, or am in this family. i want out because i don't feel loved. just take me away from here, i'd be happy.

this is why it's getting deeper and deeper and more red it flows,
