Blargh!
I hate Mondays. Seriously, who decided they were a good idea?

I have to wake up early and go jogging every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Sometimes I wish I was a pure magic sage. But no! I have to pick to cause stabbity death  to things, thus requiring more physical exercise than my lazy butt likes! This morning the clouds were thick, and at times I felt like I was running through a shower. I hate how clothes feel when they stick to my body. Ick. At least it keeps my hair from getting too crazy, although it was pulled back today.

Then, to top it off, when I got back and cleaned up and went to work, some retard scribbled on a book. I know we can remove the scribbles with some alchemical potion or another, but there's always the risk of taking off the original writing, too! I thought we were sages, not preschoolers! Does anyone else ever feel this exasperated with their fellow priests/knights/whoever you are around?
