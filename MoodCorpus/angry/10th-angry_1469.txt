soc class
In sociology today we watched a video on social class, and I must say. The video got me primed for a fight. There was this guy, a WASP as he called himself, explaining the ins and outs of being included in the rich events and such.  This idiot was saying how "you either have it or you don't. You can't be nouvou rich and be invited, you're born rich, plain and simple. If your short and fat, go away. You won't be let in. I mean, we are wealthier, more attractive, better people, and extremely more intelligetn"

I wanted to kick him in the face.

I'm sorry, but I could out perform half those twits on any IQ test. I am intelligent, in fact, I am very intelligent if you'll allow me to gloat for a moment. But seriously. I'm poor, most people from Roscommon are not extremely wealthy but we turn out great people too. We've got people in the best colleges, in the best jobs, in movies for crying out loud. 

Grr. It made me very mad that someone could talk down like that. I guess I've never been exposed to that kind of attitude (with the exception of Ellen last year) and it just pisses me off and saddens me at the same time. I mean, these people have such narrow minds and think they have an appreciation for the finer things in life, but what about the regular things in life that are really cool too? Like friends who've you known all your life and will still be calling up when your 80...going to the lake on a not million dollar boat and sipping beer with your friends...saving up and feeling so bad ass when you buy your first car..
Isn't that what's important? The plain jane regular day to days that keep us going?

I just realized that I was very philosophical just now, but hey. That idiot in the movie made me mad. I want to shoot him in the foot.
