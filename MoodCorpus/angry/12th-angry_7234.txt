I hate cigarettes
I hate cigarette's with a passion, if you smoke, your stupid & you need to quit. Have some self control, and do it already. Your only hurting the people around you who don't chose to waste their money on stupid addictions like that. Like whoever serves you at the bar, those around you, those you live with, your children, your friends, your boyfriend/girlfriend, your server at a resturant, your animals, etc. etc.

I've been around a smoker my entire life, my mother. She's been smoking for over 30 years now, and its a dirty habit. We will go on vacations or on an airplane trip & she smokes CONSTANTLY. Her entire life revolves around this habit, and i just hate it. I'm worried about her health, and she doesn't even care...It's like once she told me that she doesn't believe second hand smoke is a real problem, she thinks someone just made it up someday. And she doesn't care that me & my father inhale her cigarette all the time, or that i inhale so many people's cigarette smoke at the place i work. We almost banned smoking in my resturant but we didn't & my mom got MAD that in NYC she had to smoke outside.

Ugh, it just furiates me. I will NEVER date a smoker, and i don't think i could ever have a best friend that smokes either.

Anyways, i have this biology test friday that i am completely freaked out about.. :( I absolutely despise that class, and anything science related.

I'm in one of those moods where i really miss chris. I get to see him next week though, he'll be on spring break :) I am VERY excited to see my sexy man, and i'm not going to let him go.....i need a hug haha.
