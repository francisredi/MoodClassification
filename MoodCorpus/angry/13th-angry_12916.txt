yay for dsl
the only good thing thats been happening lately is that the dsl is finally up, even though my parents are anal and are like never going to let us use it. but hey, whatever. nothings really been going all that great that i can think of... all county stunk- i hate those things. i dont know why they even have them because theres only like 3 people out of everyone that actually wants to be there, you know?? whatever. my parents arent letting me go to europe, and the only reason its making me mad is because they just wont say a "for real" answer- they always avoid it and never talk about it. that and they tell me a different excuse every time and she tells mike and missy excuses that she never mentioned to me, so who knows. i just want my parents to go not die, but be hurt because they've been pissing me off and they are continuing with it, and im getting really annoyed and i cant take much more of it... grr! i told my mom that i wanted to do the intramural badminton thingies in the morning and that justin was going to do it too so id know someone there and she got all huffy and was like "well the only way ill let you do it is if mike does it too" and it starts at 7 in the morning, so theres no way that even if he for some reason said he would do it that he actually would be ready before 7:30, so im just going to drop the idea. i just hate how everything has to revolve around my parents and mike. like everything does. and i just hate it and i wish it would stop. mike keeps comming over here pretending to look out the window and such, but hes just tryign to read what im typing so im going to go now. toodles
