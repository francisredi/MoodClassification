[Take Your Sweet, Sweet Time]
I hate not having a computer. I fucking HATE it. I hate having to work around Dani's schedule to use this crappy, barely-working laptop when she gets to use my car at her goddamn leisure. I hate begging to check my myspace and shit.

I'd rather just not have a car. My mom told me that she'd get me a laptop with her income tax, but my fucking bitch of a grandmother took a lot of the money from her because of some stuff my mom owed her. That's bullshit. You'll be dead in ten years anyway, grandma, if you don't stop smoking (which you won't even attempt), so what's the difference in letting my mom keep this money? She's a single parent raising three kids, and you're a selfish bitch. 

I can't believe my grandmother would be so mean. That's her daughter. I'm her granddaughter. She's always telling us how much she loves us, but when it comes down to it, she loves herself ten times more. I've known this since I was a child--that's why I never really liked her.

Why does money matter so much to us? What's she going to do with that money? Buy cigarettes and go out with that man who's having an affair on his wife with her.

I hate people. And I hate my life.
