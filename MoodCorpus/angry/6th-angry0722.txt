It sure as hell ain't normal but we deal, we deal.
I hate how we go through so many ups and downs in our lives. For instance, was it not two weeks ago when I was in a horrible mood and practically in tears and hating the world, and now I feel like everything is okay. However, I've trained myself to know that nothing stays well for very long because then life would be screwed up if happiness lasted more then a month. Maybe i'm sad about it or depressing but this is just one of those things that I can count on to be true. 

Another thing that has been bothering me: I feel like a horrible friend. I can't even begin to explain it and I dont think I want to.

Midterms/Finals coming up next week. I hate this time of the year. I hate proving to teachers that we've learned stuff because i'm gonna be honest-If i didnt know it then, what makes you think i'll know it now? Huh? 

Well... the Goonies are almost over. I am seriously in love with that movie. That chinese kid cracks me up. (=
