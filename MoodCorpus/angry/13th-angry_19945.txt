we need the immigrants 
ive never felt so fucking apathetic in my entire life. but all at once im feeling so many fucking emotions that i dont want to feel. im feeling sorry for myself again. i hate who i am i hate who i want to be. i feel so stupid. im looking back on all the guys that said they liked me etc etc and then it going no where and now looking back and seeing that they are with someone...they are happy and i still havent moved on. it was .so.fucking.long.ago. and you know why i like seeing people, mostly guys drunk, because its as close to my father as i will ever get. i like seeing people so drunk and careless and stupid because its all i know of my father. i want to spit in his fucking face, im so tired, im just so tired. i guess i hate life so much because it takes so much fucking energy, im just so tired why cant we just rest. 

i went shopping today with meg. i dont know why things have CHANGED so much. i love her so much, i just, i dont know if love her. it KILLS ME to say that. i dont know whats happening to our family.
