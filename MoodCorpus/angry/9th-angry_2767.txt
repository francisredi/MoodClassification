Well, his dog tried to maul me last night. Which caused me to get mad at his inability to properly train the dog. Actually, it didn't really try to maul me, it just slammed through the bedroom door, running me over and then growled at me when I touched its food bowl. Of course I yelled at it and made a big scary ruckus so the dog didn't get away with threatening me, but the point is the dog threatened me. What kills me is, people are amazed at how 'well trained' it is. He issues commands using the German language. When asked if he speaks German he says no, he and the dog only know 4 German words: sit, lay down, wait, and no. This is enough to impress the masses though. I hate that animal. To make things worse, the man won't neuter it because he wants to breed it. The thing is a horrible example of the breed. It is small, has bad confirmation, and some kind of inherited intestinal problem, but he still wants it to reproduce! He got it from a buddy, it has no registration papers and to make things worse, his vet told him she would give him "paperwork" stating the dog is full blooded. You would think a licensed vet would try to sway him from adding to the over population of mutts in this country. 
There are so many things we disagree upon, I really don't see how we can make it work. The dog is just one of the many things I hate about living with him. Maybe I just need to grow a backbone and go.
