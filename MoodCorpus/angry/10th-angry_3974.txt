People are STUPID, part 2
Housing Day is one of the most foul and riddiculous things that Flagler College has come up with. There are people, DOZENS of people, camped out in front of the registration table with blankets and pillows and computers and phones and ARGH. THEY ARE RETARDED. At five a.m., when all those dumb asses are sleeping, I'm going to stroll casually up to the desk and stand at the head of the line, and then, these people are going to wake up, see me, and bitch, and I'm going to say: "NO, you dumbasses, just NO. You FELL ASLEEP in front of the table, and MY happy ass stepped over you, easy as pie. Why? Because you DON'T FALL ASLEEP WHEN YOU'RE WAITING FOR SOMETHING. Anticipation 101: DO NOT FALL ASLEEP. You will get screwed, and that's what has happened to you. Now shut the fuck up." Or something to that extent. I am just...so angry right now, at everything. Shooting zombies and killing evil sword-weilders did NOT help my mood, and so here I am, trying not to break my phone or Suzi's laptop, with a monster headache, my last nerve twisting apart, and housing day at seven a.m.. There will be no sleep, and there will be no happiness. I hate right now. I truly hate. I don't quite know what it is I hate, but I do.

People are stupid; write that down, and remember it.
