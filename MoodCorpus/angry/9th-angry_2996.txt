today has sucked. 

it started fine it was good til lunch. noelle wasnt there for the first half. then she came and iwas teasing her going through her stuff cause she forgot to mention that around halloween she went to a party  and willingly played spin the bottle. well aint that sweet so of course that means if she landed on a guy she wouldve kissed him!? i dunno and ill never know because she just laughs. then she flips out at me cause i found her journal. did i open it or read it? no. i never saw past the front cover. she tells me she doesnt want me around i leave. end of lunch comes she walks past me i get angry she says i gave her the finger all i remember is her giving me the finger and walking away. 5th hour i walk the opposite direction from my class to say im sorry. she ignores me. going to 7th i also say im sorry and try to talk to her while her friend tells her shes being mean for no reason. after school. she doesnt say goodbye. so i follow her she refuses totalk and just laughs in my face so i follow her eventually i get so angry i walk away she calls me i answer in a mad one say what she says fine and hangs up. did she want me to answer and be like hi honey!??

ahhhhhhhhh i want to die.


i guess this is our last goodbye.


you dont care so i wont cry.
