okay to today was nicholas's birthday, 
Is it okay to feel out of place around your own family?
I mean its like your new in school and everyone has there place to sit in the lunch room
and you have to sit all alone, that is kinda how i feel when i get around my family
 i kinda feel like they dont really want me around.


Its weird to feel this way, like i always new something was fucked up when we are all together, and its that no one is there becouse they wanna be there they are there becouse they feel like they have to be there.
and that is fucked if you dont wanna come then dont come. dont be fake and smile tell me how you really feel, i whould have alot moore respect for you if you did. I cant stand smiling and pretending to be happy when im not. the only reason i did it today was becoust i love him and i wanted him to have a good birthday, he deserves it, 
for the way that they treat him. 

I swear almost every woman in this family is a fucking man hater they even hate the men in the family i dont get it. I think that my aunt should just be gay . Now i see why she cant keep a man, she is sooo fucking controlling. i hate it. 


It was like i was sitting there, outside with everyone and all of a suden it hit me i was looking around and everyone was smiling and laughing but if you look really really close they are all just so unhappy i dont know why i thought of it then but i just got up and whent in side and thought of the last 15 years and i thought omg how fuck up is this? and you people think that  you are normal? omgosh give me a fucking brake.

all you are, is a hypicrt all of you ...
