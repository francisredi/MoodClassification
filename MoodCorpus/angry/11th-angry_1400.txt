Why Me?
Gah... what a horrible day today is.First off, my seat in the car was in the wrong spot so&nbsp;I attempted to set it right. Big mistake, got it stuck in the the foided&nbsp; position for like 10 minutes. Then when I got to school today, I discovered that they've put a new gate up and it's locked. So I had to walk around the long way, which is longer and more round bout. So that annoyed me. Then I discovered that Mrs. Rawl didn't bring the silver paint from the middle school, so I couldn't work/finish my dragon painting. So that made me mad. I had a sub I hate, and she marked me absent, then got onto me for not doing anything where there were people right in front of her not doing anything. Choir was okay, because all we did was talk (well mostly talk sang like the last 15 minutes of class). Pre-cal suxed cause we had to do SAT stuff when because she wasn't there (I think we were supposed to watch a movie) and I don't believe in Standardized Testing (like SAT or Exit Exam)&nbsp;so that made me mad. English was okay, because I found out I hadn't failed a test like I thought I was going to, and it was okay. But the rest of my day was horrible. I came home and wrote my Enrichment project (a new song) for Timms, did some of my Beowulf homework for English, and did a little bit of Chem homework. Practiced piano and gathered books for tomorrow. Anyways tomorrow's another day, and I'm ready for anything, so bring on the rain (heh quote from a song).
