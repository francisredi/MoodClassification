OMFG
Have you ever hada friend that you loved and hated at the same time? Well me and my friend S. are like that. She always competes with me with everything and it gets me on my nerves. She and I are supposed to be friends, so why the hateration. Why can't we justbe happy for each other. I know why because of envy, we hate each others guts, but were still friends. I know it makes no sense but its so true. We are so cool with each other, but yet we still that have that secret hate that we don't want to admit. Or At least she doesn't. 

But,anyways I am digressing from my topic, HARRY POTTER CAME OUT ON DVD. I am so happy my mommy got it on pre-order, so I could watch his sexy-ass all day and night. OMG HE IS SO FINE. You know I am so sick of boys these days. Most of them are jerks and they swear that they can treat everygirl, like a 2 dollar hoe. I am so pissed off. I JKUST WANT TO BE STABBING THEM MAD TIMES. but its ok. I WILL SURVIVE. 

If you hall have been reading Mashito's journal, you should know SAM. WELL, my dad doesnt want me hanging out with her, because he thinks she's bad company. Even my mom thinks so, but not as much as my daddy. SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT HER SEX CHRONICLES RIGHT IN FRONT OF MY DAD, IN HIS CARR!!! All, my friend's know that I am daddy's little princess, but obviously whe doesnt get it cux, my dad is totally chill. But when he heard that he spazzed on me and my mom. And I don't wanna cut her off, cuz we are mad close, but I don't want to keep getting accused and questioned on stuff that I don't do or I'm not even doing.
OH WELL ONLY TIME WILL TELL.
