Today
I hate how today's society is. I hate how everyone stareotypes, but what I hate worse than that is the fact that I am scared of going to a college for Fashion/Design. It's not being intimidated by people being better than me or even the fact that I am growing up and going to a college where I will not know what to do. I'm scared because I don't want to put clothing out there that will make it big. Take a look at people. What if someone made clothing for a certain body type? Nearly every day I see some 250-400 lb. girl/lady/woman wearing something skimpy. I apologise, but having your ass hang out of a mini skirt is NOT sexy and will NEVER get you a boyfriend or a sugar daddy. And how is it that, no offence, black people have no modesty what-so-ever? Do they honestly think they get more privlages in the Unites States? I can go back and talk about how bad the Irish had it, but do I? Do I force the fact that I am blue-blood or imply that I am better than anyone else on this planet? Leave the fucking past in the past. Go fuck yourself. If I call someone a "nigger" it is for its true meaning. Ignorant. I call someone black as much as I call someone white. Now... if someone ever goes about wearing my clothes like some people do... meh. I would be ashamed to even say it was my design. I can see why Mudd and L.E.I and Aeropostale make such small sized and don't exceed a limit. They don't want these fat fuckers abusing their clothing.
