i hate alarm clocks
so obviously i hate alarm clocks. they are so useless.  i was supposed to be on campus at 10:40 today so i set my clock for 9 and 9:30, just in case.  it takes me 30 minutes to an hour to get to campus depending on which way i go, and whether i speed or not.  so i guess my mom came in my room around 9 and told me "hey, it's 9 i'm going to work, make sure you wake up and get to class on time."  i was like kfldjask whatever ok i love you bye...so it's about 10:20 and my sister comes up in my room and asks me when i have to leave, i ask her what time it is and she tells me. i got ready soooo fast that i was out of breathe by the time i got in my car.  i almost backed into her car because i was so tired and rushed.  it's funny b/c i was rushing for nothing, there was no way that i could get to campus, park and make it to class in 20 minutes.  plus with all the damn cops and super troopers on the highway i couldnt even speed.  
i fucking hate alarm clocks, i think i'm gonna just throw mine out of the window and kill it.  what is so funny about the whole thing is that it didnt even go off this morning, my sister got home at 8 and was up and she said that it didnt even go off.  stupid fucking alarm clocks, and when i have a day that i can sleep late and i have nothing to do, i can always count on the stupid thing to wake me up.  
so there's my day.  and to make it even worse i had less than a quarter tank of gas and $2 in my wallet.  

i did make it to one of my classes, and went and had a fun cup of coffee and a couple of cigs with my girl amila....
