I hate the male species!
I really do...Well at least all of the men in my life I hate.  My step dad is soo stupid it's a wonder he breathes without me telling him to.  And his I'm not even going into the topic of his friends, and then to top it all off, my own Dad whom i've never met, was supposed to come down this week b/c of spring break, and guess who didn't show?  Hm.  Guess who didn't call to inform us of our not going to come?  Hmm.  Yeah I've had it with men.  i really have.  And don't think that just because I only mentioned a few guys means they're the only guys i know, because it's the same thing with every guy i meet.  They're all dumb and stupid and I hate them.  If i were catholic, I'd join a convent, but i 'm not nor ever will I.  so I'll just stick with being single my whole life.

i'm not usually this bitchy, but for spring break, this week sucked, so i'm off to mope some more and pray to the almighty face gods to grant my wish of a clear face by tomorrow, because holy shit has my face broken out!
