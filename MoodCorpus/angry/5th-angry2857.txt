little lotte thought of everything and nothing...
So I'm really kind of mad because I found out while looking at my grades online today that I now have 2 C's.  One in Modern World History and one now in Biology.  

I'm so mad that my modern world history grade hasn't gone up at all since midterm because I really have been trying hard, I've been turning in homework and getting good grades on tests and quizzes it's just...it seems like it hasn't changed at all.  It's remained a 78% for like a month now.  Not getting any better.  Not getting any worse.

But what really made me mad today was when I saw my Biology grade.  Mrs. Mccauley gave me a 56% on my kingdom book.  What nonsense is this!?!  I worked on that effing thing all...day...long.  I worked for like eight or nine straight hours on it, pouring out my heart...and for what!?!  A friggin 56 percent.  An F.  WTF!?!  I don't even know how that's like possible.  Mary said she got like a 78% on it because she didn't put enough pictures and she didn't have captions for the ones she did have.  Like seriously, that was it.  There was nothing else wrong with it and she got a 78%.  Isn't the work more important than a bunch of pictures?  This is craziness!  I like, wanna shake the woman!  UGH!  

I seriously hope that next semester is better because I don't think I can handle too much more of this.
