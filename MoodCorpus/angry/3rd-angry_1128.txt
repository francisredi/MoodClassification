beware.. big vent....
I'm so frustrated these days.  I'm frustrated with relationships or the lack thereof.  For some reason I'm just angry about everything to do with that word.  If your a couple i'm pissed off at you.  ( no offence, it's just me being crazy.)  I hate how I feel like for me to be happy I have to be dating someone.  I hate how you have to act a certain way to attract someone.  I hate how you have to dress a certain way to attract someone.  I hate the attitude of many guys who just care about the way a girl looks.  I hate how couples always ahve to be touching. it's like their rubbing it in your face and saying I'm better than you.  your single. you suck.  I hate how there are holidays celebrating coupledom and none celebrating singledom. 
My friend told me that I should act more 'naughty' and slutty and I would find a boyfriend really fast.  That is sooo disgusting.  I know he was just trying to help but I am not acting 'slutty' to make a guy like me.  
yes I am cynical and bitter right now but I really don't care! I'm just sick and tired of everyone being obsessed with being in a relationship!!!!!!!!
