FUCK!
blargh I HATE life I HATE IT I HATE IT I HATE IT!!!!... haha meh... I'm thinking forensic psychology... but the problem is that I'd be in like training for what seems liek 6 years or maybe more... I dunno if I wanna go through all of that =\ however on the other hand I don't know if I just want to go to uni and get a psych degree and then find out I didn't need to, or that I did the wrong degree, I need some careers advice and I need it quick, ha!! It's cacky - I think I'll ask the careers lady person on monday in college... I just know that I'm kinda going off the idea of counselling psychology... but then at the end of the day money will also be an issue heh! I want to find out how much money is in each area, and then I'll be happier me thinks =p hehehe after all you only have a job because you want money... to enjoy it helps a lot, but either way if counselling psychology was dramatically more than forensics (which I doubt) then I'd take that path... and vice versa... either way I hate using the internet to find out info it's fucking useless... fuck fuck fuck fuck fuckity fuck..... I'm done =p
