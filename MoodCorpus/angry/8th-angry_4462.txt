i hate this situation.  i hate that you don't ever make any effort.  i hate that you never come visit me.  i hate that you tell me you don't want a title, but that i shouldn't fuck other guys.  i hate that you hardly ever take me out in public.  i hate that when you do, you shy away from me.  i hate that other girls still hit on you.  i hate that i still get treated like a fuck-buddy.  i hate it that you never tell me how you feel about me.  i hate it how you get so jealous.  i hate it how i get so jealous.  i hate how you end a conversation without a goodbye.  i hate that you never call me.  i hate that when i call you all you do is play videogames.  i hate that you talk to other girls more that you talk to me.  i hate that i never feel pretty enough for you.  i hate how consumed you used to be with your ex-girlfriend.  i hate how you've never met my family.  i hate how we don't go on dates.  i hate how unsupportive you are of dc.  i hate how i never know if you really care or if i'm just here for sex.  i hate how we both want to do so many new things, but never experience them together.  i hate how i never see you.  i hate that we don't communicate.
