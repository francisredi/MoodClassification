stressness
So lately, I feel that I have been under a lot of stress.  I hate saying "im stressed out", because I shouldnt be, cause what things in my life really make me stressed so much?  The answer is not much because I have it pretty easy.  I guess the fact that Im working basically 3 jobs is doing it.  Lambardis being the most stressful out of all of them.  It sucks there, NEVER WORK THERE!!  If it wasnt for the fact that angela was there, I wouldnt even go in anymore.  Physical Therapy is pretty easy and actually relaxes me.  Im pretty sure I want to become a physical therapist, I enjoy being around that kind of atmosphire.  I guess another thing stressing me out is track a bit.  Ive been getting angry at everyone.  I was just about to fight someone today lol.  I really just need to calm down, I think I should go for therapy truthfully.  I get mad over the dumbest shit and hold a grudge on it.  I don't think there was one night this week where I was ready to fucking break something, anything I saw.  

I cant wait for this vacation to come, hopefully I can get some rest and hangout with some homies.  This normally doesnt sound like me but I need to get trashed this next week.  Either alcohol or trashed with hangouts lol.
