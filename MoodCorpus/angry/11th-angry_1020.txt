Please can somebody tell me how you can hate something if you do not know what it is?

'I hate anarchism' 
'what about it do you hate?' 
'Oh, everybody would just go and kill everybody else. I think we need rules and regulations.'
'People kill each other in our current society' 
'Well it would be worse. I mean anarchism is just our modern day society minus the rules so it would just be like todays violence times a million'

'Anarchism would never work'
'Yeah no it wouldn't'
'I don't think it's really meant to work'

Argh what kind of political philosophy would it be if it wasn't meant to work?? Anarchism is gravely misunderstood. I'm not going to claim that I fully understand it, and therefore I can not fully argue that I agree with it, but I am compleatly and utterly fed up with opinionated cunts thinking they can argue that something would never work when they don't know what the fuck that something is. It would be like me attempting to argue that a far right dictatorship would never work when all i knew was that it was an ideal that included lots of rules!
And on another kind of connected point, how can you state whether a political ideology would or would not 'work'. What do you mean by it working? Do you mean that everybody follows its rules correctly, or everybody believes its true? Do we say that democracy doesn't 'work' because our country goes to war when some of us don't want it to? Do we say that democracy 'works' because much of the world claims to be living in a democratic society? Therefore are we going to say that dictatorship 'works' as a successful way of governing a country because there are currently dicatorships "successfully" running? Where does it end?
