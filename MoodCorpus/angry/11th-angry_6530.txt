Relationship=EW!
I hate how everyone I know has at least SOMEBODY who "likes" them or whatever. I don't and it's stupid. Like lame and borring. It's uneventful when you don't have anybody that likes you as more than a friend. So that's why I'm always bored. Also, I hate how people will never give me a chance. They just think I'm scary and I have no thoughts at all about ever wanting a boyfriend. Of COURSE NOT! IT'S MARINA! ARE YOU CRAZY?!?!? That's actually NOT something I WOULD NEVER consider. I've been FUCKING "CONSIDERING" it since I was in FIRST GRADE! That's really basically all I've ever wanted. Like on my birthdays when I was little sure I liked presents but I really just wanted somebody from my school to say, "hey Marina. I like you a lot." I KNOW IT SOUNDS REALLY STUPID AND LAME BUT IT'S TRUE! I SHOULD get over it but I CAN'T! That's why this whole thing with Julia and Wesley is making me stressed out. I think they should just go out because I don't see why they can't. They like eachother and they should make the best of it. Other people out there (LIKE ME) don't have what they have. So I'm confused as to why it can't just be what it is. I can tell he really likes her and she really likes him. So if I were Julia (which sadly I'm not) I would just ask Wesley what he thinks they should do and see what happens. So I am very angry with the fact that NOTHING ever happens and EVERYDAY I see what I want right in front of me. Like it's being shoved in my face and laughing at me because I can never have it. If I care, I'll get hurt and if I don't care, people wont think I care! SO IT'S ALL POINTLESS! I SHOULDN'T COMPLAIN! I HAVE A GREAT LIFE! Just when I HAVE NEEDED the ONLY thing I've EVER needed and I can't have it, that kind of sucks. So now I'm done. Buh-bye.
