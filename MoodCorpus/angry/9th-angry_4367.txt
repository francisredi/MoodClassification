HATE YOU PEOPLE
I officially hate people in general. 
Ok there are so many fucking things that are bothering me today. 
I hate when people need to be right no matter what the hell they are talking about. They will try to manipulate you into thinking even something you KNOW FOR SURE is wrong. And if they fail they just make shit up about nothing. Like, "Yeah its only 10 bucks for me and my family to go to Florida this year" you just want to like...shoot them in the face. NO ITS NOT! And then you tell them that and they are like "No I deffinitly know for sure it is five dollars." It makes me so angry. I can't stand it. 

Or when people flirt with my boyfriend. That pisses me off alot. You don't just start hitting on the kid when he is just minding his own buisness on a bus you stupid freshman! Not that you are a threat, but you are insugnifficant and hardly good looking. AND to think I thought you had a nice ass! Apparently you have some nice skills too! Like howewrecking! Not to mention working your girly charm to try and win him over. ALSO, you have your own goddamn boyfriend you little brat! Why would you even need him? He is taken by someone alot better looking than you will ever be and that is the fact of the day princess. So lay off and stick to someone on the same level as you.
