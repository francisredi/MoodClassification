why do i continue to dwell on this bullshit?
so uh yea, i like tessa, but im sure as hell that will never happen, shes in love with someone else. makes me kinda laugh though, or feel pity, i dont know and im not for sure. fuck it, i dont think she is worth any of my feelings at all, am i being mean? or was i being to sweet to begin with? i dont know, nor do i fucking care at all anymore about anyones feelings. yes that is right. Fuck you, all of you, except a few..yes it is true, my feelings are more important than yours. oh no sweetheart for awhile your feelings were more important. i should concentrate on myself..yes i should

i like crystal too?! yes i do. will that work out? highly unlikely..im just "that friend". the fall out guy...the "i feel like shit, will you talk to me?" type of guy, im sick of it, sick of it all, again fuck you, i have my own fucking feelings..............fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you

i hate you all, i hate you all, i dont hate myself anymore for hating you all
so i will drink more, and i will drink even more, i'll pretend i love you
but i will hate you even more than i did before!
