I still haven't had this kid and I will be 40 weeks pregnant on thursday. John graduates from basic on Friday and I can't go see him. Life sucks. My mom is re-engaged to that asshole. I hate his guts and when he is around she acts like a big baby. I have two pet turtles now because they were given to me. They'll be easy to take care of. I'm miserable over all though. John has been gone for almost two months and he won't be back till the end of June. Johnathan won't have a clue who he is when he comes back. John has changed somewhat and it seems like it is all for the better. Absence makes the heart grow fonder is a true statement especially when you love someone. I know that what he is doing is the best thing for our little family and so I stay strong for him. I'm hoping the baby will hurry up and come so I will be busy but he's too comfortable in there. The only person I have able to talk to mostly is my Grandma. My mom is almost always busy with work or something. When she is home, I can't talk to her because her "man" is always calling or coming over to her house. If she gives anyone other than him attention or is distracted by anyone's attention towards her, he is jealous. If anyone other than her speaks their mind to him, he's automatically pissed. This guy is everything I hate in a person. Why do I even bother to care and try to help my mother better her life if: 1. she won't listen and 2. she is too blind to see the truth of the matter?

                                                 Full of frustration and anger,
                                                                    Shady
