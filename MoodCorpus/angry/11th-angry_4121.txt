ummmm...
Alright first things first... I HAVE A TUMER (I'm thinking Arnold Schwarzenager Kindergarden Cop) "It's nat a tuma"...  No really I have a tumer, it's not a big deal but it's fun to say!!  
I just finished filing my fafsa and I am officially independent of my parents which is such good news!!  I am going to get some money next year for school!!  Yippeee!!
Now to finish... I hate dumb girls!!  D-U-M dumb!!  I have a woman in her 50's today talk bad about me after I told her I couldn't do something for her.  Which ok, if you're going to do that I guess that's alright, cause I guess I do that a lot, but don't do it when the person is five feet away and can hear what you're saying!  She was acting like a junoir high girl and I was really mad!!!  Also, to top that off I had a girl come up to me in choir and fake apologize to me... that's right!  She came up to me to apologize but she basically told me "I'm sorry that I was doing that, but you were doing something way worse!"  Ummm... as YOUR SECTION LEADER I CAN DO WHATEVER THE HELL I WANT TO!!!!  I'm thinking that I will round kick her in the face next time I see her!!  URGH!!!  That made me so mad!!  BAH!!!
