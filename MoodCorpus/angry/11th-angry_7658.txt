Im telling the truth!
God, im getting so fucking pissed at my parents. I came home from tess's and i wasnt talking to my dad, and my mom came hobbling down the stairs *she tore ligiments in her foot from dancing* and she was like "Are you mad at dad?" and i was like...NO...i just wanna listen to music and dance right now, im in a good mood. and she was like "well are you mad at me?" No i just wanna listen to music right now.

then a while later i came up stairs and i was talking to my dad then she started stompping around and was like "why cant you just tell me your mad at me" and i just looked at her for a while and was like i wasnt mad, until you decided to tell me what i was feeling, that piss's me off. then she got her food and waddled in to her room.

and now my dads trying to do this thing where he shoves food down my throat...im not hungry!!!

This week has been really fucked up.

I mean really really really fucked up...and its only..monday...fuckin a!
