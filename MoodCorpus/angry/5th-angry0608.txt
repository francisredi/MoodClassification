I FXCKING HATE TODAY!
I EFFIN HATE TODAY! Im so ready to kill something its not funny!!!! Nothing good came from today. OH FUCK! I jsut realized i have to do some homework! Ah. Work was hard hard hard hard hard! My back kills,&nbsp;the person at work that thinks shes better then&nbsp;the rest of us forced me to do&nbsp;her work, then&nbsp;talked rudly about me infront of other people, i was left outside freezing for half an hour because my parents forgot me, i hadnt eaten in 8 hours and i couldnt feel my hands. Now i think im sick. I got another project today at school in parenting, and finally&nbsp;got the geography culminating, Josh is my partner this could be bad because we are both procrastinators and he&nbsp;is computerless..&nbsp;yay more stress just what i need. On top of that Josh didnt have a good day and that was sorta not meant to be, but was taken out on me. Im angry and im taking it out on others and now there mad. Today isnt my day. I warn you your&nbsp; best to just stay away from me for a bit. This stress is going to kill me. 
Over and Out.
