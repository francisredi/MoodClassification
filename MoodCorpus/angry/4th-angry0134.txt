Grrrrrrrrr
I have just recieved an e-mail from my boyfriend (that feels strange, I called him that). It goes like this ...

whats wrong? please tell me, i no there are some things in life u havent enjoyed, but i want to try and help, id like to think me being ur bf is more than just fun, but also a friendship relationship, its up to u if u want to tell me, but if u hav nobody u want to talk to, which u might have and thats good, pain and anger is much like alcohol because it strengthens when bottled. 

yours truely

What am I supposed to say? I always put on a front around other people, including those that are closest to me. I can't just blirt out what's wrong. I have no choice but to lie. I hate doing it, but what am I supposed to say 'Well actually, I'm feeling suicidal. I hate my life, and don't see the point in it!'. I can imagine the reply! Not good. I have just sent him a reply saying 'I'm fine'. That is the only thing I can come up with, without sounding too fake. I really hope that he won't have a go at me!
