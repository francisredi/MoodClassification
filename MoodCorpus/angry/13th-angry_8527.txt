 ok this is only brief as it is way WAY too late for me to be concious considering how shit i am feeling  i have a cold  i have a LOt of work to do including a workbook of whick i need to write 20 pages for at least ...by monday  i hate my placement  the area i am in sucks donkey cock  the people in the office also suck donkey cock  i keep crying for no reason during the day (ok there is a reason i hate my work THAT much) but you know me I DON'T CRY  i am feeling very negative at the moment and thinking of quiting my course  except i will not quit coz i am not a quitter ( as much as i wanna be) and i want to prove i am better than all of the fuckers in that office and i believe that half the students on my course are going to be 10 times better social workers than any of the bastards in that shit hole.  i hate my life  a lot!  oh to (you know who you are) ps mum gets out of hospital sat. i think in case you wanna know and i will have some more for you to beta soon if that is ok  and when i finish this placement (if i do ever) alcohol and i am afraid to say karaokie (sp? that looks wrong) do you fancy it?
