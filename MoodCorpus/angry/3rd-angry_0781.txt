Nooooo!!!!!


The day has finally come that I've been dreading so long. Part of me knew that it had to come no matter how much I hoped it would be sometime in the far, far furure. Coca-Cola have stopped making Vanilla Coke. Excuse me while I slip into Episode III Vader mode....

Nooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!



How could they? I am absolutely addicted to that stuff. It is the only fizzy drink I actually do drink now. Everything else just pales in comparison. So how could the evil, evil, EVIL idiots at Coca-Cola stop my supply like that. No big news story, no 24 hour coverage on CNN, no personal e-mail to me saying how sorry they were and offering counselling for my loss. Nothing. 

The only reason I found out was that I tried to stock up on this nectar of the gods for Christmas and absolutely nowhere in town had any of it. Not a surprise since it actually sells out pretty fast in the main supermarket I shop at but the others usually haver some in. Not today. Not for the past few days. my Better Half, who loathes the stuff, said they had probably stopped doing it but I didn't believe it until I checked google and it was confirmed at the BBC News website

The best bit? The part where the spokeswoman says it has been a big seller but the consumers are telling them they want something else. Namely Black Cherry with Vanilla. If you are in the US that is. We in the UK have just the plain Black Cherry to look forwatd to. Sorry but no thanks. While Vanilla Coke is the drink of the gods, cherry coke is the drink of the devil. No matter what the colour of the cherries. Looks like it is back to Pepsi max to help cope with the cold turkey. Happy Holidays to you too Coca-Cola, you bunch of lemon eaters!
