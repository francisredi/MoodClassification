RAGE
have had an awful night's sleep, am hoping that getting this out helps...

I have been predominantly keeping a positive perspective post XPredX, and have put alot of energy into me.  The timing helps, with the combo of holiday PTO and major work project in a lull.  Intermittant to low amounts of this rage.

But part of what has me set up with my therapist for 4 weeks in a row (I was down to every 3-4 weeks) is that I feel this incredibly huge amount of rage against myself.  I have virtually  NO  BS detector.  Even as a teacher, I had set up a missed test/quiz policy that was excuse neutral but still had some beneffit for the students who didn't miss.  

And I'm someone who tends to (as a default) like someone until given a reason not to.  And XPredX was introduced to me by a friend I've known forever, so that's like a super-extra-in.

But from the moment he started pursueing me, something felt off.  Alot of the time we were together (until, at friends urging, I decided to shut off those voices and just trust in things), something felt off.  I'm too trusting, so I wouldn't have assigned it to what I now know it was, being lied to from day 1, being made sport.  And I didn't trust me.

And get so angry at me for being so naive and for letting myself be so dazzled by smoke and mirrors and letting little pieces of me be changed (not even just in general-which would be enough-but by someone who never even knew me).  

My therapist and a friend with her MD in Psych both understand the anger but feel it's unwarranted.  The friend pointed out that guys like this get away with this so much because they're GOOD at it.  And XPredX is 38, and has admitted to predatory behavior back to college years, so he's got like 20 years game.

But on some level I knew - and convinced myself I wasn't right.  I don't know if it wouldn't have been better to have had NO CLUE.  And I am so angry at me for that at times I can hardly stand it.
