Loving Animals
Against my better judgement, I went ahead and finished reading Magic's Silken Snare today.

Yeah. I've been trying to find a story or series of stories that did not seem a chore to read, or that don't piss me off in regards to mechanics. It's difficult, but finally, this one holds promise. It's like the Cloudmages trilogy in that it explores the culture of the main character, which here is Romani, but also like the Kusheline trilogy in that it is chock full of intrigue and politics.

Ms. Gilligan made a gutsy move by inserting a fictitious country into the world of the Middle Ages, but it is not without merit. She needed, for the sake of story, a land tolerant of other religions apart from the standard Catholics of Europe, so her use of her land of Tyrrhia is not jarring where it could so easily have been.

There were parts that made me very angry, but not mechnically; no, I was angry witht he characters and their society. This is a good thing, because it shows that the author has woven her tale in a way that makes me care about those involved, so I feel the emotion of indignancy along with her main character.

Hurray for finding a good book and author.

That finishes up this block of fiction, because next is Page After Page.

In other news, if it wasn't so late, I would take a small trip to Starbucks to just sit and be away from home. I'm really, really mad at Mom and Dad says I'm supposed to just leave when I'm that upset. If it wasn't so late, I totally would.
