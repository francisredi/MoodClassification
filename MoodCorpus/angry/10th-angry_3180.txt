I have been so friggen emotional all day today and NOOO its not from Valentines Day. I had to hold back tears a few times for pretty lame reasons. I even cried at work today. I just cant handle people getting mad at me. One day I will get mad at a customer and that will be the end of my employement but i wont care because I fucking hate it there and I hate Nikki and i hate Carol and I hate Ashley M plus so many more people who arnt worth listing. Ok, hate is a strong word so I take that back. Sooo I got off at 8 tonight but couldn't get a hold of my mother for a ride because the phone was busy for an hour and of course she was all drunk when she came to pick me up. I hate driving with her when she is drunk let alone anyone who is drunk.It scares me. My mom is so irritating when she is drunk too, shes like a little kid. I can hear her in the background yelling at me, trying to tell on my sister for bugging her.Apparently Kylers back but I havnt yet talked to him. I hope I do soon though because it would be nice see him. Ya I should probably do some homework.
