fuck.  fuckfuckfuck.

well, found out today that i have an ear infection and most likely a sinus infection.  lovely.  thanks mr. emergency room doc.  i came to you because i couldn't hear well out of my left ear, hoping you might flush it....only to find out that you "don't have time for that".  So I paid a $50 co-pay and you don't have TIME for me? What the fuck.  I wouldn't have even come if that were the case.  I would have waited and made an appointment with my doc.  Fuck. 

So, i get a prescrip for antibiotics.  good.  at least this will clear up everything i've got wong with me.  but another problem pops up.  i go to CVS to get it filled, only to find out that I'm  no longer covered by my father's insurance.  Why?  because they don't think I'm a full time student currently.  Last semester I went to the registrar's office to fill out that fucking letter to send to BCBS to tell them i'm covered as a full time student for both semesters!  And according to them, I haven't been covered since 10/31/05.  GOD.  So I had to pay out of pocket for my prescrip which was $20 (my father reimbursed me because i was going to be stubborn and not pay for it).  

I hate doctors, i hate my ears, i hate my body, i hate this i hatehatehatehate being sick.
