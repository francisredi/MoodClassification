no matter how many times i make it go away, my rage and anger and hate ALWAYS comes back ten times worse >=(
i dont kno how much longer i can hold it back
nikki tried to help me by makin me tell her some of the stuff that angers her
and it helped i guess
but now im just even angrier than i was before
there must be something seriously wrong w/ me
i shouldnt be this angry
i feel like im going to brutally kill someone or something
i cant really tell people everything i feel cuz almost nobody cares
maybe a couple of people and they have their own lifes to tend to
i tried to help nikki feel better about her life w/ kevin
i dont kno why i did
considering that thats one of the things that pisses me off
heh
there really is something wrong w/ me
im loosing my fuckin mind
i won first place in skillusa at school
im one of the best people at davies in electronics
im going to states competition next month
any normal person would find that to be good news
i find it to be a waste fo fucking time
im angry i got first place
im fuckin crazy >=(  <=(
