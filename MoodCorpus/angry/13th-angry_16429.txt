Cross-post from "What are YOU angry about now?"

I'm getting slowly and slowly more angry at some of the people here. 

Specifically those who unconditionally defend Clan. "Oh, he's not a bad guy," you all say. Well, I've got news for you. The "big, bad, Clan flamers" are not the problem. It's Clan himself. "What has Clan done to deserve this?" you say. Plenty of things. Taking people's ideas (continuously) for one. Shameless self-promotion (remember all those posts, and that topic, saying "Play my game, you decide whether I'm good or bad?" I do). Constant flaming of Jello B (yet people consistantly ignore this one, for some odd reason). For evidence, I cite this line of posts. Notice Extremejon is basically taking Clan's side no matter what. Now, for a sensible post in the reasonable side, here.

I'm getting sick of it all. Like really, really sick of it. Sick of users who won't fess up and admit Clan is causing problems, and insist he's got all good intentions, and yell at the rest of us for being angry that he constantly does these things.

Sorry to rant like that, but I really had to get it out.
