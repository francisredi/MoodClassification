ok so they arent really my "girlfriends" but thats what we call eachother cuz we are "bestfriends" get it? lol. anywhos. so i just ended a fight that i had w/ Stephanie Long. i admit im the one that started the fight, but im also the one that finally ended it with an apology. at the end of it i wrote, "if your still mad then please dont respond cuz i cant take the stress" and she responded and said that she was tired of fighting too. so i guess we're better...at least a lil. 
okay im really excited to go to TN for spring break cuz i really really want to see paige and heather...like..big time. but...now heather is saying that IF i see her that her boyfriend has to be there cuz hes some bipolar freak that doesnt trust me even though he hasnt even met me. i mean..come on what is going to happen huh? im going to HIT on her!? yeah rrrrright! so she cant come to the movies w/ me cuz her stupid boyfriend cant go to the mall w/ us. so id prolly have to see her at her house. but, what if i just stop by unexpected on a SCHOOL day so that he wouldnt be there? would he get all PISSED off about that? would he get mad at heather cuz she saw me w/o him being around? thats gay and i dont like how hes controlling her. we just took care of this problem w/ melitza's boyfriend being a control freak -mason finally broke up w/ her- and now heather's boyfriend is too. i mean..come ON he's NEVER even met me. how could someone not trust someone when they havent even met them? well i dont care. im going to just show up at her house and hopefully brandon wont be there cuz you know what? now i dont WANT to meet him cuz im not on best terms w/ him right now. gahsh i just wanted to see her...what a pig.
