you're like my favorite damned disease
unfortunately my whole computer went through a total re-whatever it's called. i lost a whole lot of important files, and a lot which weren't that important but had a lot of sentimental value.. like all my itunes lists which i'm most upset about. i only have two gigs of free space on my whole hard drive, so i need to do something about that soon, but right now i'm too pissed to care.
on another note, i've realized that i'm spoiled to the point of antisocial, and i really don't have a problem with that. i hate putting up with people's typical bullshit, and i find chit chat to be so draining, therefore i end up isolating myself from everyone. if i can't have it my way then i'm not going to hang out, or at least that's how i've felt lately. i hate sharing therefore i'm in a single, i hate chit chat, therefore i eat most of my meals alone (except when i'm with davey because silence isn't uncomfortable with us), and i hate compromising therefore i avoid social situations in which decisions are made. and i'm really ok with that. so fuck you, world.
