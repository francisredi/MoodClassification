Looking for a job and whatnot. 
This weekend I've been calling up pharmacies (Shoppers and Pharmasave) to see if anyone will hire me or at least take my resume. I made a calendar of all the places I needed to call back because their manager or associate wasn't there. I'm slowly calling people back. It's a little hard to take sometimes. For every 10 "no"s you get, you get MAYBE one "maybe". So, out of calling what feels like 20 different places, I have to call about half of them back, and I got to fax two resumes. I hope I get a reply! I hope that if I get a reply I get good pay! Hahaha. I'm running out of money in the bank and the insecurity is an uncomfortable feeling. I know that I can always get money from my parents, but still! Yes...hahaha. I hope I get a job so that I won't be bored in the summer. 

I've been cramming this biochem assignment for the last week, but mostly the end of the week, and it's STILL not done. It's taking forever. I hate journals. I hate articles. I hate google. I hate ovid which keeps logging me out. I hate research. Yes. I'm bitter. BLARG.
