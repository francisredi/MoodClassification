Laughing
I hate it when people laugh at me, i'm sure allot of people hate that.  i have a co worker that i sit at her desk while she takes her breaks and goes to lunch.  She laughs at everything, it's annoying i try to ignore it but yesterday when i sat for her on her last break she laughed at me, i accidentally wrote "1-8-06" instead of "2-8-06"  on the sign out sheet.  she laughed at me like it was soooo fucking funny, whats so funny about that?  i even asked her that.   

me:  why is that so funny? (with a bit of bitch edge to it"

her:  i dont' know, you put a "1" instead of a "2" on here

Me:  Oh yeah, that's so funny. whatever have a nice evening, bye.
 
what pisses me off the most is that she KNOWS i hate it when people laugh at me so i have no idea why she did it.  see?  even people i like do stupid shit to hurt me and she isn't even a friend.  Now when i come down here i say "hi"  and "have a great lunch"  no talking or anything, maybe that's how i should keep things with her.  I've never had this problem with the boss lady or a couple other co workers, i mean we have pissed each other off but we have NEVER made fun of each other.  wtf?
