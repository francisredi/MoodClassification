I don't hate him because he's black, I hate him because he's an asshole.
I fucking hate people like this. For Christ's sake, I just wanted to sit alone. This gigantic Freshman jock (who just so happens to be black) tries to sit with me. This kid is an asshole, plain and simple, and he's given me shit before. He tells me to move in and I say, "Fuck no!" because there's three open seats around us. He constantly insists on sitting with me until I say, "For fuck's sake!". He says, "I'm sorry, did I just hear the N word?". I have a blank look of WTF on my face. I don't say racist things. In my opinion, theer are no whites, blacks, Asians, Hispanics-whatever. There are just PEOPLE. So he continues to give me shit until he eventually gets my seat. Then it turns out Jason's not on the bus, so I go to take one of the backseats. Because he's an asshole that likes to piss me off, he takes that seat, so I move back to the other one, and he keeps switching! Eventually the bus driver yells at us for this and he continues to now scream what I "said" to the bus driver. It finally ended when someone just told him to shut up. Honestly, I would've brought up the fact that I have a black uncle were it not for the fact that I believe in just standing your ground. Goddamn you, Gandhi...

No wonder people joke about why I haven't blown up the school yet.
