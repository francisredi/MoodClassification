Battlegrounds, and HK farmers.
Disclaimer: This is just a rant thread as I am very angry right now. If you choose to read, it may not be complete thoughts but merely a way for me to vent my frustration. You've been warned.

I hate Honor Kill Farmers, I seriously do. I cannot stand it entering a BG where in the first place you are outnumbered but if you work together, you could still win or put up a fight at least. Only to look at the list of people on the BG and see known HK farmers. It annoys me to no end. For instance a char named Pandom on my server a Gnome Warlock, will never join a group, will not listen to reasoning and will make no attempt to help Alliance win, she will simply, go to where she sees Horde and start killing. You may not think this so bad, but in a battleground, things go very poorly unless people contribute to the GAME not just themselves. I cannot stand seeing her getting into their flag room in WSG simply to kill more and never touch the flag, or merely kill the easiest people when shes in ours and they make an offensive. In AB I will see this gnome, among others, simply fight people on roads or go to enemy flags to fight and do nothing to defend or assault. It ruins my day every time. I am so angry about it, its not even funny anymore, I really wish you could vote to kick your own players from a BG. Thank the Maker I haven't seen this happen as much in AV, the real BG, but when you can't get into that for 4-6 hours, and you are stuck with WSG and AB, it irritates me. Has anyone else run into this problem or something similar? Any solutions you've thought of? I mean other then the fact that I could stay out of those BGs, but I won't because I want reputation for the nice PvP items.

These people really should stick to raiding towns, where they don't harm the progress of other players, (It's a PVE server no ganking so thusly no progress interupted).
