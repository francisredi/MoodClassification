everytime it seems like i have one part of my life decently managed, something pops up in another part to drag me down again. i don't know how to deal with this, i don't want to get in a fight with my best friend, which i know will happen if we talk b/c neither of us know how to talk to people when we're pissed off. i don't know what to do, i don't know how to make this go away, i don't know how to make everyone happy. i just don't feel like this is my fault. you had other things to do, more important things than me, than our friendship. i'm so incredibly sick of losing my friends, it's honestly the story of my life. i never thought that i'd lose you, but i've felt it happening for so long. i didn't confront you like i would anyone else, it's too hard to confront you, so i just let it go. i thought that maybe it was just a phase, maybe we're both just really busy and it'll get better once we're out of this little dip in the road. but it's never happened, and now you get angry b/c you can't go somewhere b/c you have to work, and because your sister, who has been there for me through all of this and has been the one i can actually talk to, is able to go instead!!!??? you caused this! it was because you didn't have time to do anything with me that i began to hang out with her instead, it was you that pushed her to go with me when you couldn't go somewhere or do something that you promised to do. and now she's my best friend, and now you're angry. not only are you angry, but you're trying to make it so that she can't come either by talking joel out of driving her?? are we back in 5th grade???? you're 3 years older than me, but you're such a child. i just can't deal with this anymore, i can't deal with this bullshit. i never had a sister, and you're the closest thing i've ever had to one, so i dunno maybe this is just how sisters fight. but it sure does suck.
