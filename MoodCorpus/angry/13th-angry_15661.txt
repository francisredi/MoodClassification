Today I just don't feel... happy.I hate these days.I just don't want to do anything but sleep, or lose myself in someone elses life in a book or movie or something.I don't want to&nbsp;be me today, and it sucks, 'cause my life is actually not too bad.&nbsp;Sure, I'm failing math and my science report is 3 days late, but as far as lives go, it's by far not too bad.I have math next, and I'm feeling especially resentful towards my math teacher, just because I know that math could be so much better without her.We had a substitute on... monday? Well, whatever, the point is, even though this sub was so annoying, the entire class was so much happier, and we worked a lot more than usual.&nbsp;I think my usual math teacher is trying the fear-instilling method of teaching, thinking that if we're shitscared of her and her detentions, we'll work.But it just doesn't work, and you'd think after last year with me, she'd realise that her teaching methods don't fucking work.But no, she goes on making people cry and intimidating people, and calls herself a the fucking head of math.I am getting very angry at her, and I have no need to be.&nbsp;I hate it when I get like this.I know people are having major issues right now - people on my flist are having major issues, for gods sake.And I'm ranting 'cause I don't fucking like how a teacher teaches?Fuck.In other, happier news, we won the debate by four points, which is rather good!And I didn't completely stuff up as third speaker. I do need more practise, however.I want headphones right about now so I can zone out.//EDIT//Also - I bought GoFyesterday, and watched nearly all of the special features.&nbsp;And I squeed majorly when they started talking about Alan Rickman in 'Conversations With The Cast'.And Emma Watson said his voice was amazing, and the others agreed, OMGZ.*nerdnerdnerd*
