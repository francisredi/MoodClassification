Life Sucks!
Well, I have to say that this LJ suits my personality bettter! I feel like I am on this carnival ride that just keeps going faster and faster but I just want it to STOP! I havent posted my fics in a while and that is starting to take a huge toll on me. I feel like I just dont want to do it anymore. And I hate myself for it. I love Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Spuffy but I just.. dont know anymore. I know people like them (My Fics) but they arent favored as much as the others. My browser (AOL) Is starting to do funky things and I am getting pissed off with it! It is messing up my site to where I can't do anything with it because it looks disfigured. I also have tons of work that it due tomorrow and I havent even started on it. I also have a project that I need to do!I hate school! I just want to fly away! Fly away from all of my troubles! Well, I guess I am going to go work on that crap! Until next Time! :)
