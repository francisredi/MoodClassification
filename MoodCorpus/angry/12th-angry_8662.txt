Nope, still haven't moved house
Well hello there!

Bit odd today.  Very premenstrual which may be the reason behind the tantrums I've thrown these past few days, and the reason for sobbing my heart out at work.  Good job I work with a 90% female workforce, go girlies!

I should never have agreed to move house the same year I'm getting married.  It's nowt but arguments and hassle.  People should also not look at houses that a blatantly too expensive for them to afford and build up peoples hopes!  Some utter bastard came to see our house TWICE, (once with friends)and then bought a different house!  I just hope the one he bought has dry rot, asbestos, damp, woodworm, ancient indian burial ground under the foundations and a dead dog buried in the kitchen.

I am so sick of being at work too.  I want a holiday where I can forget about everything to do with everything, then come home and find that everything is sorted.  Hate looking for houses, hate having to compete for houses, hate being sent to look at houses by IDIOTIC estate agents who have already accepted an offer on said house two days before we go to look at it. THEN WONDER WHY WE'RE ANNOYED!!!

All I want to do is be in a house I like in the area I like.  That's not too much to ask is it?  Then I can get married happily and return home after honeymoon all serene.  Then I'll have to start worrying about producing children.  Brillo pads.

Bloody bloody bloody god damn and fuck
