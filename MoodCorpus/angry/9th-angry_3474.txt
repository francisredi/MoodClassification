NEWS FLASH: GOING TO LAKESIDE MAKES ME DEPRESSED
It is exhausting to go to school each day and find out about the next controversail thing and how the administration has bungled it. I can't take it any more, it is getting to the point where I dread going to school. I end each day put out and wondering if there is anyway out of the hole we have created for ourselves. The Boys Don't Cry fiasco is the fucking icing on the cake: just bc we made a bad decision about Dinesh does not mean we have to make another bad decision to remain consistent. I am beyond angered, I am at the point where just writing this makes me want to cry. I am angry that an institution that is supposed to be devoted to OUR EDUCATION is so wrapped up in their internal battles, mistrust, and anger that my education suffers. I am angry that parents, cannot fucking keep their mouths shut and just not sign the permission slip if they are so offended by this. In the midst of their battle over politics, students are losing. GROW UP AND GET ALONG!! How the hell are we supposed to do it when left and right we see horrible relations between the administration and teachers...it's a climate of fear and anger and I for one cannot take it much longer.
