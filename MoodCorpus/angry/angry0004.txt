Dream connection
(using code names vampire= my bf roo= me n phils friend jacks= chick that use to like him al= chick that he use to like)

Yesterday i wasnt in the mood to talk to anyone so i avoided vampire and roo. Roo never guessed to ask wat was wrong she would rather bitch about it behind my back. she figures im just a bitch n nothing could be wrong. Vampire tryed to ask but i had nothing really to say dunno wat was buggin me. He walked away at the time i needed him the most. 

My dream this morning was: was at jackz house dunno if i came wit vampire or not but we were there. I was still ingorin him and hid in the basment. actually i came back up and somthing like vampire was pissed and gave up on me n went to jacks. They had a lovy dovey thing now where i wondered did we break up or would this be cheatin? vampire had turned very evil no pitty and i was hurt. Crying alone. Jackz rubbed it in my face he didnt want me anymore. then was gettin a ride home from al with vampire and jackz. It sucked and woke up wantin him to see i still want him.

thinkin about the meanin: i think jacks is really roo. vampire and roo have been hangin out a lot..i feel like i dont know ether of them. even tho roo is suppose to be vampire and my's friend she seems to always back him up and they seem to talk about me and vampires realtionship a lot more then i even do. Mbear reported wat roo had been sayin n she pretty much thinks im not good enough for vampire. </3
