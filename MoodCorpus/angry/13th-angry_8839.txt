i hate talking to my dad about money. absolutely hate it. i don't even want to discuss it here. just more proof that he doesn't really care about me. to him, i am just an extra expense.

what is one of my biggest pet peeves?

i hate it when i pour my heart into a relationship and get nothing in return. (i.e. my dad. or sometimes my boyfriend). it's not fair to me. and what i don't understand, is what makes them so much better than me. so while i'm doing everything and then some that they ever asked of me, i just get kicked in the teeth. what am i doing wrong? 

my whole world is falling in and i have no one to turn to. not even you, because god knows that when i have a bad day you usually just make it worse instead of making me feel better. i'm not ever aloud to feel sad around you, or vent about whatever went wrong. i thought that part of the idea of a boyfriend was that he is there for you, cares for you, and actually makes your life easier by helping out. but you actually make my life harder. 

i just don't understand why you got so mad on the phone. okay, i bitched some about my bad day. but then i wasn't going to take it out on you. i was asking about sparky and stuff and was trying to be in a better mood because you had done nothing to upset me so there was no reason to be upset with you. right? but i didn't watch the lady vols game. well looks like you're not doing anything so i'm gonna go. what? where the hell did that come from? are you mad because i didn't watch the game? i really have no idea where that came from. and then you hung up on me and won't respond to ims. wtf??

i guess i'm just so tired of working extra hard to impress you (both) to keep you around and not getting anything out of it. i'm just getting fatter and older worrying about people who obviously don't care about me.
