I HATE YOU BULGARIA
I hate you for being in the teens and snowy and icy and windy every single day.  I hate you for accepting this ridiculous cold front from russia.  i hate you for giving me a flat with a glassed-in terrace with 4 broken windows, so that all this snow and ice ends up coating the floor, turning said terraca into a skating rink. I hate you for all the bruises i have from falling in my own house.  I hate you for putting my STOVE out on aforementioned terrace.  This, obviously, is a problem.  Everytime i want to eat something more than say, a bag of pretzels and some kashkaval, i have to slip and slide my way to the stove and then it takes FOREVER to heat up, so i am out of luck if i wanted my noodles, before say, August.  More importantly, right now, I hate you, bulgaria, because of the door you gave me that seperates my terrace from my living room.  it's broken and now will not close, meaning (you guessed it!) all this wind and cold has now infiltrated my living room, meaning that really there is no noticeable difference between inside and the desolate cold wasteland that is my town.  At least in here I can blast my music.
