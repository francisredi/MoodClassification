grrrrrr.... a semi-good day just went to a bad day in like 4 minutes. thats gotta be a record. someone was getting on my other s/n and whoever it was was REALLY makin me mad. i mean i would be less mad if they would have told me who they were but "ill give you a hint" doesnt exactly make me too happy. X-( im mad now. GRRR. good thing i changed that pword tho huh? lmao. 
anyways today was boring. i went to school, finished my exams and found out i got the highest grade on my geom exam in our class!! i got a 81 but still!! :D that was good. but then i came home after school, got online for a lil bit, then scott called me and told me he was goin to brents house for the night. so yeah hes not online. not like it would matter anyway if he was cuz i couldnt get the net working cuz of the fricken weather till like 10 minutes ago so yeah. I HATE FRIDAY THE THIRTEENTH!!!!! AHHHHHH!!!! lol. ok i feel better... not really but hey. 
so yeah, this weekend i am doing ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!! cept prolly sit on my butt all day in front of the cpu. i have bball from 9-11 sunday morning but other than that... nuthin.
