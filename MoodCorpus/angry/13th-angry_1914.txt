Blahhh.
I have no clue why but I'm getting REALLY annoyed with people who don't normally annoy me lately. Which is like everyone. Which makes me get annoyed with myself cause theres no reason to be annoyed at them but I can't do anything about it. Ugh, I dunno i just feel so tense lately. Like at any moment I'll want to yell at someone for a remark i'd usually laugh at. I dont know what's wrong either... Which annoys the hell outta me.

Oh and Hippie, your not getting the $50 unless you bring my $25. And i wont be there the first few periods cause I'm getting an x-ray for my finger. Which is fucking retarded because I told my mom not in the morning cause I might have to do my speech. And I am supposed to do it tomorrow now and I can't. And just ughhh.

I dunno, I'm just being mood swingy lately and it's bothering the hell outta me cause i hate it when people get mood swingy. So I'm feeling like a hypocrite. Greattttt.

I dunno, going to bed cause im TIRED. And have been tired ALL DAY.

Kaythnxbye.
