Iron Chef is my new favorite show. when I actually watch tv, that is. And it's on the food channel which is right by the travel channel, which has all those haunted location shows that I like so much. But my point is, is that I was going to go to bed but got distracted with eating dinner and that lead to me getting sucked into Iron Chef, which lead to my mom asking to borrow my laptop so she can search for Mark's e-mail addy in the white pages, which sounds SO STUPID TO ME. And that's why I'm here. She can't use my laptop if I'm using. And I don't want her to use it because she doesn't need to find out if Mark (her husband) has an e-mail address or not, just like she doesn't need to CALL HIM all the damn time to find out where he is, and show up at his work just to say hi... -____-; omg, that bugs me. People in relationships BUG ME. It's just... I don't know. If I was dating someone like my mom I would dump his ass so damn fast. I like space. I like NORMAL, not this OMFG!STALK!STALK!INVASION OF PRIVACY, LIFE WHAT? ALL I NEED IS YOU! crap. Grrrr.

Ok, so no more ranting for me. I'm just going to sit here, all tired and cranky like, and wait until I think it's safe to fall asleep and leave my laptop unattended.

Kate, seriously, need to do something evil tomorrow. I don't care what. Plot EVIL EVIL THINGS.
