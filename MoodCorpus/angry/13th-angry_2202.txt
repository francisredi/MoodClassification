Anger part II
So its not gone away. None of it. I havent felt any different about her, havent wanted to even call her. I just every time I think about her, my blood boils and I cant see straight. This is not healthy. A couple of my friends are like "I really wish you two would get back together" and I just look at them and flinch. One time I had to walk out of the room, which was bad because we were in the middle of an airsoft war, which didnt end well for the others.I dont want to be with her. I dont want to see her, I dont want to talk to her, I dont want anything to do with her. I cant stand the thought of having memories of her..Prom, Homecoming, my 15th and 16th birthdays, Christmas' everything. I have those memories of her and I just cant take it. Its like I'm stuck between wanting this anger to leave and than not wanting to see even think about her ugly, disgusting face.I'm stuck, and I dont know what to do. Well I do, but I am not going to do that. I would rather be beaten with a bat to my face before I willingly pick up the phone and dial her number. See? Cant you tell how angry I am with her? Gosh this isnt right, and I dont want it to be like this, but I just cant stand her. Thinking about her now is almost ruining my day.I honestly believe with all my heart that this is my punishment from God for making such an ignorant, stupid mistake. And the judgement is remembering her.
