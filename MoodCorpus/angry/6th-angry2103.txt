the end of innocence
Yesterday I was propositioned by a deaf man in a grocery store.

I was minding my own business in the supermarket, standing in the flour aisle and trying to decide between Integral and Reposteria. A deaf man approaches me with a clipboard, pointing and asking me to donate money to his cause. I politely decline, because I hate being solicited for money in public places like that. So then he tries to introduce himself, and I politely smile and go back to staring at the flour. Then he leans over and says, "Wanna go have a drink?" Uhh...first I think, he's obviiously not deaf. Second, what the fuck?! I, again, politely decline, but he keeps insisting that we "vamos a tomar algo" (have a drink). When I keep refusing and appear slightly agitated, he says, "Why? Have you got a boyfriend?" I tell him yes, which is a lie. So he begins to walk away, and then turns around and smiles, and grabs his crotch, making a sort of you-know-you-want-summa-this motion. I was so appalled and confused that I grabbed the flour and stormed out of the store.

I'm not sure why it struck a chord with me, but it made me SO angry. I mean, okay, if I'm in a bar and I start flirting and someone comes over and is bothering me, I can understand - maybe I deserved it. But I was in the f-ing supermarket, minding my own f-ing business, and this little scoundrel who isn't even deaf comes over and propositions me in a very explicit manner. SCREW YOU. This, of course, made me angry at all men in general. Coupled with recent boy-drama or whathaveyou, I just felt completely fed up with being an object, a thing, a person whom you respect so little that they don't even deserve to be left alone and un-sexed in the fucking supermarket. I'm still kind of angry about it. I think I'm the only person in the world who gets upset by the fact that there are several people willing to sleep with me at any given moment. I must be crazy.
