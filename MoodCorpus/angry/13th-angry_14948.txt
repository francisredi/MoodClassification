Fuck life fuck everything.
Today went pretty good until about right now. Lets see school was fucking slow like always but hey that's cool. There was a crap load of teachers I had out today. So I got to do basically nothing today. Then I went home and me and Jazz did our little senior prank for Mrs.B. It's pretty funny. We did like a fake voices try out. Then I went to track practice which was pretty easy at first then got hard. We got there and we worked on blocks and our field events and then he was like out we are going to start are work out and that was hard on me cause I didn't properly stretch. But hey over all it was an easy practice. Then I came home and watched American Idol kinda disappointed by that. But hey Chris still kicks ass. Then me and my mom tried working on my dress. Gave up on that cause I really need a manican (however you spell that) to hold the dress up to make it easier to work on attaching things. So I waited for Chris to call and decided fuck it I'll call him. Well I find out he's dead asleep and I'm fucking pissed about it. Cause if I ever was asleep I would call him before I headed off to bed or decided I was to tired. But hey guys are guys and they always get there way and always get the good side of things. It seems I can't be mad at him either. It's like against the rules or something. He has so many little and big things he can get away with and I won't be mad at him but ohh if I pull that shit ohh he gets mad. Doesn't fucking make sense. But hey why does it fuckin matter how I feel or think. Well forget all this mad shit I'm writing I'm just fucking frustrated and shit so I'm out!
