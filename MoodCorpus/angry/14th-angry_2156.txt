I guess it's all a matter of opinion really
*sigh* 

I generally hate the big one-stop-shop stores like Kmart, WalMart, Target, etc., but when they're close to home and all of your hair products have run out (and you're a total product whore, joblessness be damned) they sometimes become a necessary evil. Super Kmart, late morning, is an absolute and utter nightmare. Mainly because, well... WHY THE FUCK DO THEY CALL IT AN EXPRESS LANE TO CHECK OUT WHEN THERE'S NOTHING VERY EXPRESS ABOUT IT? Why, why in the name of all that is sane and holy did I have to get behind the woman with more than her allotted 15 items (try closer to 30, each item a separate piece of toddlers' clothing) who then decides to WRITE A FUCKING CHECK?! Seriously? People still write checks in stores? Grrr. And then the cashier needed a manager to approve the check. Meanwhile, the man behind me in line was standing way too close for my claustrophobic nature to handle. *shudder* I just... *hand gestures* 

I hate people. And leaving the house.
