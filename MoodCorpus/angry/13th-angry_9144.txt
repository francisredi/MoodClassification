Here's to the Humanitarians
Fuck you! I really, really hate my job. I never thought I would have said that about any job I had. I have had some suck ass jobs but I liked them because of the experience I gained or the people I worked with. Here - I'm at a stand still and I fucking hate everything about this place. Wait, that's not right - there are a few people here I can stand. And lets not forget I get paid for 40 hours a week and only work about 30 or so. Sometimes less. But - to be told (basically) to my face that I'm not even ON THE totem pole, I'm buried under it is just a bit much.

Today at the staff meeting we were told that the annual meeting would be held at a different (more expensive, socially acceptable, ritzy, schmoozy, classy, snobby) place and as staff members we don't really have to go. We were told that the people they would RATHER be there will be the ones with big wallets and big bank accounts as well as big connections to even bigger wallets and even bigger bank accounts. In other words, staff aren't welcome unless you're part of the elite (directors and financial development departments) because the directors know what are salaries are and they KNOW they don't pay us enough to afford to go to one of their high end functions. Talk about a kick in the teeth. So much for employee apreciation. They can all suck on my left tit. Fucking wankers.

Yes, I'm still pissed about it. Gawd I hate this fucking hell hole. I don't know why I'm so angry about it - I just am! FUCKERS!
