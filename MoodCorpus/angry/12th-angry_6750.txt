BAD DAY!!!!
Worked sucked i've had bad days at work but this was the worst Mary my boss put me and Valerie in all day by your self till 4:00 witch she never dose this is the first time ever it was so bad Valerie wouldn't go near customers so it was all left up to me to tend to the customers fill the counter I didn't even get my last break but she got her's she made sure of that.

Then there's Jennie and the kids they have been staying at our house since last tuesday and I am losing my mind, Jared is acting up so bad cause he wants top go home but Jennie dosen't care and nobody can say anythign to her cause she'll break down and start crying cause she is soooooo stressed, she is going to court this Friday cause of what happened last year she drove her car in to a telephone poll cuase she had a fight with her boyfriend but she was also drinking that night so they are charging her so she goes to court this friday. Ok this may be mean of me but I don't feel sorry for her she did this she now has to deal with the consequences and I told her this you would never believe her response well I didn't intend to be here sitting here right now grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr that makes me mad so I turn to her and I say you have two kids what would we say to them your mom decided she didn't want to live anymore iit's not about you anymore their lives come first now she was like no no she makes me so mad she needs to grow up and become a mother to her children. So I have to go around the house all happy and smiling and not say anything to Jennie cause she'll break doen and cry well it's not goign to happen and I've told her more then once it's her fault she has to go to court this Friday and that she has to pay 5000 for her lawer and it was over a guy she is no longer with GROW UP!!!! Poor Tristan and Jared their mom is so selfish and their dad is a dead beat poor kids.
