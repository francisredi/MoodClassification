"you can have some of my candy"
My 2 consecutive days off are finally over. It hasn't exactally been boring, me and Nashon hung out basically the whole time. I went to Amandas at nite for a couple hours and then either went back to nashons or he to my house.
Had some crazy shit happening tuesday at work, but everyone who needs to know about that has been notified :)
Learned that you've gotta keep your mouth shut about work matters in and out of the job. THe only person I a can 100% trust is Nashon. Hes a  great friend.
Amanda and I went out to dinner tonite and we talked about moving in with each other in a year and a half. I'm gonna start saving now because I really need to get the hell out of this house. My mom is not allowing me to sleep over anyones house anymore, and vice vera. Shes giving me this huge bullshit excuse but what I think it comes down to is that Nashon is black, and she doesn't like him sleeping over. They don't even ackonwdlege him. I especially hate my mom for that. 
Then she was trying to say i made her sick these past two nites from being over his house and then him coming over here. First of all, I didn't make her sick, she did that on her own. And second of all I've been having sleepovers since I was 9, and in highshcool we had coed sleepovers. Even david used to stay over! And Nashon is respectful enough to sleep in the guest room. Dayna even concured about this being such shit.
I'm angry, hurt, tired, sad, and dreading work tomorrow. I need sleep.
Goodnite evil world.
