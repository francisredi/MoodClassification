I am turning off my cell phone. 
Yeah I don't feel like talking to anyone tonight. I am gonna curl in my bed, listen to music on my iPod and pretend that I live in a far distant European country, far away from America, far away from California, and far away from Elk Grove. I hate you Elk Grove. Why couldn't I be born in Los Angeles with my family? Theatre is a drag. I am in a rough patch right now. I hate school I hate theatre. And being emo seems to be the only alternative right now. And I hate being emo. It just seems real weak too me. To blame shit on the world and our parents. I don't like being weak. But I don't feel like blaming myself right now for being annoyed I just want to blame my uterus. I am pretty down on myself right now. I feel sick to my tummy too. I wanna be with family that loves me. I want a hug. I want to spend time with Sam. And see my Tia and Tio. And my Mama Tita (Nana). And it's very strange but...my Dad just asked me if I want to drive to Los Angeles next weekend...to see my Mama Tita. And I do want to go. I need a break. Thank you. 

Going to try to find a way to write something happy,

Ericka.
