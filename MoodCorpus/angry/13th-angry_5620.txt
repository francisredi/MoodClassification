I hate the fucking world. Everyone's being a major fucking bitch today and I am sick of this shit. SO SICK OF IT! Luis was being an asshole today and I was pissed off at him all day, then Candido started. Gilberto was mad at them because they were being assholes to me. Missie said he was back there talking crap to them which made me laugh. But, still, it was just an awful day. Like I told Missie, I was starting to like Luis again, but he just blew that one. Blew it straight out of the damn water. He can't say anything to me to make it better now, or fix it, or whatever. I am tired of it. Why are guys always bastards? What have I done to deserve being treated like shit?! Obviously I've done something wrong. I don't know. I said that I am sick of Luis getting in his bitchy moods and my cousin was like, "He's mad at you because you've rejected him about a hundred times." Well, get the hell over it. I am not a complete asshole to Israel and he led me on for ages... I still talk to him and I don't fucking call him stupid shit. I am done.
