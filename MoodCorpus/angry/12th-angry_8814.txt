Ughh, fuck this.
I hate my life, and most of all, I hate how people that are supposed to make it easier are the ones who make it more difficult for me. This past week, my mother has been the most unberearable and uncooperative person I've had to deal with in a while. And this is not BECAUSE I crashed her car. In fact, she barely mentions anything about that. She's just makng it impossible for me to get another car, and not because she doesn't want me to have a car or doesn't want to pay for it, but because she simply has "more important things to do." Those things are also known as, "work." Let me remind you that next Thursday I'm supposed to give a talk on some shit or other than her stupid Russian postdoc did because he doesn't speak English and she doesn't want to do it. I don't know ANYTHING about the matter, and no one has made any effort to teach it to me yet. But oh, she has SO much work work work that is not Anna because Anna is just second rate since Anna is family and that isn't important, family can wait. I fucking hate workaholics, because their family can always wait. I hope that I never become one because I could never forgive myself for such a thing.
