FUCK YOU TOOTH BRUSH!
Ugh... so first day of vaction I get ditched after someone promises to hang out. WELL FUCK YOU!  INstead I went to Hartford to hang out in the hood and I got hit on by some black ghetto kid that scared the shit out of me. Then i went to Will house. Now splinter is sitting on my lap. Macie is feeling better. Eh! I feel like shit. I just hate how people just ditch you. Iw ouldnt care if I got a fucking phone call oh I dont feel like hanging out...cool man. just dont out of the blue ditch me for the second time this week. Yea you like that! I am gonna misspell everything! Whatever! Canada in a couple of days. Why the hell am I staying in the fucking state. There aren't even decent people in this fucking state. Everyone is the same. Fake. I dont ask much from people. I guess being a bitch is the way to be. Seems to work for the people who are well off. Grrrr... I just need a massage. It is so much easier to just have one friend. Cause then you dont have to feel like shit when other people ditch you. See I understand why I avoid many people. I usually am not negative...I love to be laid back and love people. But when I am hurt and mad I am mad. I guess I am very emotional.
