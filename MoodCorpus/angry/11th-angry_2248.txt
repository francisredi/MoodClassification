Hullo.

I have a dull and boring life, non-stop essays and speeches no word from my boyfriend and long depressing hours in which I pretend I'm somewhat happy. I wish to hear from my boyfriend but something tell me I've been forgotten again. Apparently I just one of these people that have friends but never anything more. I haven't heard from Matt in so long that it makes me wonder if he does care.. I know that sounds awful but come on..

I'm down and somewhat depressed and theres a part of me that doesn't really care and yet theres a part of me thats crushed. Also, it seems no matter how much I work on something or whatever I'm never able to really make anyone really happy. Yeah sure I cheer people up by listening to their problems and giving them advice if they want it.. but Only one person so far has done that for me. I'm still kinda down. Maybe I'll eat my weight in icecream or more junk food and feel better sweating it out and working on speech after speech this woman has us doing only after a week. 

What's the point of me even being on here other then talking to my only friend that is online right now and asking her the questions I need to to help with my essay. I seriously hate all my teachers and I hate yesterday and I especially hate today. I getting bitched at everywhere I turn and I'm getting irritated by stupid people at college that don't know what "LEAVE ME ALONE!!" means. They keep bagering me 'How are you and your boyfriend? How are you guys doing? Why aren't you wearing a ring?' I'll tell you why. "LEAVE ME ALONE CAUSE ITS NONE OF YOUR DAMNED BUISINESS!!! IF I WANT TO TELL YOU I WILL!!" 

I don't think I have gotten all of that out of my system and at the moment I don't care.. I'm going to listen to my music and make a crappy draft for my picky ass teacher. Bye for now!
