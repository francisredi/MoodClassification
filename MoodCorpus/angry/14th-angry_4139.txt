triflin pplz
i am soo angry that i have to sit here and even be thought of as a person that possibly harassed another human being.  i am soo angry that i tried to help another person and that person turned around and lied on me.  i mean that just makes me not want to help ppl. but i'm sorry that one person isn't strong enough to stop me from helping others although i must admit that if that person is ever in need i would hesitate to help.  I am about ready to give up -- i give up trying -- i'm tired of trying to do the right thing.. i mean i don't want to be rewarded everytime i do something right but i definitely do not expect to get penalized for doing the right thing. i mean wat kind of sense does that make. the next time someone on my floor anywhere is in trouble i might just turn the other cheek b/c ppl want to call blame on u -- i am soo angry i feel like hating this girl. i din't hate her before but the thing i hate most in the world is being lied on -- i can't deal with it when innocent ppl get hurt. i'm done
