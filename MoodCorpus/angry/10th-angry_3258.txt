i'm literally shaking, and i'm not entirely sure why. i saw a surgeon today, he had to cut my arm open to get the implanon thingies out, he was incredibly rude and arrogant and acted as if me being there was a complete waste of his time and seemed rather angry at me. after i get piercings my body goes into a bit of shock, i usually get pale and shakey and light headed, i'm assuming the same happens when i get two needles and have to be cut open to have things removed, it wasn't anything major, but still. i think the fact that he was such a hideous human being (or atleast came across this way) has made the aftershock worse or something and now i'm tense and shaking, i feel like either crying or screaming and it's been like this for the last 45 minutes.

in movies there are always pubs people can go to and sit alone at the bar and drink, for some reason i've never found a pub i'd be comfortable doing this in, none of them really make me feel comfortable to be in alone unless i'm waiting for someone, this is a shame because i'm so in the mood to do that right now. instead i'm in a cafe with a cider waiting for my body to calm down.

stupid lack of control over my body. it should feel what i want it to feel damnit.

i hate surgeons *glares*
