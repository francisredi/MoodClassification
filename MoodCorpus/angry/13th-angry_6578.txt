What the hell is wrong with everyone
Why does it seem like everyone around me makes the obviously worst choices.  I think that they want to get hurt so that people sympathize for them.  It is like extreme pitty party.  Like pre pitty party.  LIke they are so bored with life that they are willing to do something incredibly stupid just so that people will feel sorry for them.  For example a friend of mine was talking to me about something that could be very hurtful to herself or other people, and she is asking me for advise, and when i tell her what i think she gets mad at me.  Why do you ask for advise when you don't want it?  You know what you want to do, and you are going to do it anyways.  So don't ask me, because i am going to say what i think and then you end up getting mad me.  All of friends are adults and I can respect thier decisions, but I can't give them my consent on everything, it doesn't mean that i will hate them for what they choose to do.  I will get mad if they get pissy with me if they ask me to tell them how i feel and it is not what they want to hear.  Anyways.  So that is all i have to say about today.  I hope next time i write it will be better news.
