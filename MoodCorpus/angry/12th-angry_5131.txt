I hate gangs

Not only as general rule of hating all criminals, I hate them more than megalomaniacs. At least megalomaniacs have some intelligence. These guys all use one insult. Gay. Yes , ha ha, I wear faerie-ike wings. Nice use of connotation there. Dumbasses. At least try to be a little original. How's a guy supposed to develop a image as a superhero if you won't try to come up with some pun or original nickname. No, you call me that gay flying dude. What pisses me off the most is that you actually think there's something wrong with being gay. I personally am not, but some good friends of mine are.

I especially hate gimmick gangs, you know, the ones that have a central theme. Especially those goddamned Jetpacks. Yes, laugh at my wings go on. You'll all fall after 5 minutes when you run out of fuel. Of course I'll have to rescue you, me being the nice guy that I am. What really bugs me is that you guys keep trying to fight me when you get out of jail, despite the fact that the same thing happens everytime. I am seriously contemplating just letting one of you drop to you death's so the lesson will actuall get through your thick skulls.

I just thank God these guys are so easy to beat however. I would seriously hate having to fight large numbers of actually competent people.
