Why don't they know me?
I'm starting to think that no one really even wants to know me. I've tried to be 'myself' and it's working, mostly a success at 'being' it, but as for people learning the difference, it seems as if my 'friends', the ones I suggest be myself, are instead remembering the 'old me'. I thought i've been clear enough about who I really am, and you all have things your doing that you think was the 'old me'. Ryan saying that I have a 'dirty mind', when i'm really usually the last person in a crowded room to get a dirty joke. It kinda makes me mad too, because i'm not really a dirty person, i'm not looking for sex. Another thing? Yeah I told rach I kinda wanted to lose my virginity before I was 18, but i really don't care either way. If it happenes it happens, i'm not LOOKING to do anything. And your all saying i'm 
'preppy' and i'm a 'drama queen' and all this shit. Well, i'm not. I may dress preppy, but it's cause I like the way those clothes look and feel on me. I may act 'preppy', but it's really not preppy. Sure I like perfume and makeup, and i like to style my hair nice, but i don't talk about boys all day. In fact, most of the day I go around with my nose in a book, how many preps do you know that do that? I hate being judged, I hate lables, and i hate people saying I have a dirty mind when I don't. It's really starting to tick me off, and if you guys continue to do it I might just block and/or stop talking to you until you realize that that's not who I am anymore.
