Strikes make mego a ball of flaming anger
Ok so its not even been a week and already all I've heard from myself and others is flaming anger.  I understand what OPSEU is striking for.  I get it...yes it will benefit students in the future but what about your current students??  And why now?  There have been strikes in the past but they've done them in the fall and such.  Making sure no one is in jepardy of losing their credits or job opportunities.  I feel such rage to know that I've paid for a service that I'm  not receiving.  The best part was when the government announced they've raised tution fees.  Talk about a double slap in the face.  Hey college students please pay more money for an education that you're not getting. Anger.

I'm also bored outta my mind.  They don't have shifts for me this week at work and since I would have been starting all new classes I don't have a clue what to read.  So I've been watching movies, visiting friends, watching movies with James, watching more movies, sleeping in really late, reorganizing my room, putting photos in photo albums...I dunno what I'm gonna do tomorrow.  Not much you can do with ten dollars in your bank account.

I never thought I would want to go back to school this badly.  Hopefully if nothing happens over the weekend the government will legislate them back instead of using the "wait and see" approach McGuinty is now using.  I want to graduate!!!!!  I was just seven weeks away of actually finishing something for the first time in four god damn years.  ANGER.
