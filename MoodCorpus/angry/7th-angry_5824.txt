We should be whispering all the time.
So right now, my mom is on the phone with my aunt in Iran and they're discussing about these two guys that were supposed to publish and distribute her music books in Iran for her, but instead, since the copyright shit is fucked up in fucked up Iran, those cunt-hungry jackasses stole my mom's books and making mad money off of them.




I fucking hate thieves.
How low can people go?
It's a test to see how horrible they can be, how much they can hurt others.
I had to learn that I can't trust people with shit either, last year when some assholes stole my ipod from my backpack.



I don't understand people.


[I've stopped cheating on tests, if anyone's interested to know. It's been a month. I realized it's at the same level as stealing, basically... sort of. My reasoning for cheating was that school means nothing to me so it doesn't matter if I cheat. But still, I felt like shit as a human being.]



+I really hate people. If I could, I'd just blow up people whenever I wanted.
++I was showing my mom my CDs and we were having fun, then my aunt had to call and put my mom in a bad mood with the news. fuckfuckfuck.
