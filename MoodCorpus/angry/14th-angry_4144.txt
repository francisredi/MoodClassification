longest week ever
yeah so basically something bad has happened everyday this week where i have wanted to cry. but i can't because i only cry, infront of ppl coming home from Cape Cod and show nights.&nbsp; so i didn't and even when i was home, i couldn't i wasn't angry enough, and i don't cry when i'm angry. i just pace and flip on people. which i should've done. but i was so pissed that i was going to hurt someone. so, i knew that wasn't right. i really don't feel like going into detail of why i'm angry. but i will say that its gotten so bad i'm making a burn book :-D. i'm an evil whore, wat can i say. upon looking for a notebook, i discovered i don't have one &gt;:-o. which is VERY depressing. so all my anger is still pent up, i need to release it before i see a certain someone or else bitch is gonna die :-D and i'm serious. well okay. done being obnox. so yeah.&nbsp;went dress shopping and yeilded nothing. :-( but i did get a really yummy lunch. which was good
