anger
Being a hamster, I have limited emotions that I understand fully. Most emotions I show other than peacefull tranquility and fear are just mimiced emotions that I learn from humans. But, for the first time in my life I am experience rage. I have joined the coalition of hamsters freeing hamsters (a group set out to ensure hamsters the right to live their own life, be it by the guidance of a human or not), and I have been targeted by one specific hamster leader. His name is Leather. He has the leadership quality of a irrational tyrant. He has had the position of leadership for too long. He believes himself to be almighty and he will strike hamsters down because of personal conflicts with his wife back at his cubby. I will have a break in my journal for a time that I cannot predict. I have some soul searching to do.. also I must try to figure out this rage that I feel. I am yet to understand it. Me and Leather may have a little hamster to hamster.. if I get the courage.
