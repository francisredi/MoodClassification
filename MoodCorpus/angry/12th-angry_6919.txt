I hate my fucking school.
Seriously. It's full of preps who I hate and most of whom think I'm weird for some unknown reason and "punks" who only hang out with their own kind. Or they smoke pot so I want them dead for being morons. I want to switch schools so bad, but I can't now. I'm taking AP History next year and have a really great teacher, my guidance counselor is awesome, and I know exactly what classes I want to take next year and senior year and switching now would screw that up. 

I just can't stand walking through the halls because of all the stupid preps flirting with idiotic guys who think they're cool and all the general morons who don't know what the hell "polite" means, or "smart" for that matter. I'm sick of having free time at the end of class to talk and not having anyone to talk to that I can actually stand. I'm sick of people trying to make fun of me because I do Sudoku and they only hate it because they're too stupid to do it. I'm sick of the people that are smarter than me thinking I'm an idiot just because my middle school education was tragic. I'm sick of the people that are dumber than me and try to be better, like Josh in Spanish. I learned how to conjugate in 4th grade and have learned it over every year since, so I think I know a bit more than him. I'm so sick of girls talking about their boyfriends in front of me because it makes me feel bad that I've never had one. I'm sick of people talking about drugs and smoking and drinking and sex and teen pregnancy because it shows how horrible this generation has become and I'm one of the few who is against every one of these things. I FUCKING HATE BUTLER!!!
