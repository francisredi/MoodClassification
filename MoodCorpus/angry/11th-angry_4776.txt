this sucks
i am having a really shitty night.  nothing bad happened to me today.  the weather was good.  i got a 25 cent raise and my paycheck didn't suck.  i successfully made it through the day without buying more cigarettes.  i joked around with my manager.  i had pizza for dinner.  and yet.

and yet, i hate not being in a relationship, my friend didn't call me back so now i'm sitting on my ass watching tv on the first friday in forever i was hoping to go out and have fun at a bar, my dad beat me to the treadmill and i have a giant zit on my face.  i hate feeling like this.  i'm going to have fun tomorrow; movie with deanna, ska show with cindy.  but today just fucking sucks.  i hate living at home.  i hate living in the suburbs.  i hate feeling like my life is stuck! goddamit, it's like the last five years never happened 'cuz i'm back at home gaining weight and boyfriendless!  i feel like i'm fucking 19 again and it sucks!  when the HELL is something going to change permanently for the better?  i've put all my goddamn energy the last four years into two relationships that turned into spectacular failures and have absolutely nothing to show for either of them.  i'm not in a good mood.
