The fucking itch.
So yeah, I just posted at about 10:30 buuuuut I have concluded that I am capable of hate.  I always assumed that hate was such a strong word and that I never really truly hated anyone until this particular person came into my life. This person is like an itch that I can't scratch, impossible to get rid of. They always find a way to creep into my mind and always find a way to fucking annoy me, even if we aren't speaking. I can truly say I hate this person with everything inside of me, mostly because of their nasty habit not to give a shit about others and their strange way of being the biggest whore I have ever met. So this is to YOU, I hate you. You have spent enough time wandering inside my thoughts and haunting my feelings. It's been so long and my hate for you only grows bigger into this big cloud of bitterness and despise. YOU made me miserable for so long and it didn't even phase you. YOU have lied to me in every way possible just to make my life harder to live. I am sorry if you can't have what you want. You're a filthy tramp. Live YOUR OWN life and get the fuck out of mine, I am disgusted with your existence. You try and try to burrow into my life as if I am some idiot who can't pick up on you distructive ways. You try to play it off as "oh we'd be better off friends". Yeah, "friends" so you can get me where it hurts, a straight blow to my heart. Take what is yours and leave what is mine be.
