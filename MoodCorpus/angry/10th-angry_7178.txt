Tired
Today I am just fed up, and tired, I dont know why Im in such a crappy mood. Some of it stems from being broke, despite all these adults in my house. Some of it from the blatant disrespect from my kids. I love my place, but I hate that its always dirty and messy. The kids say they are cleaning for me, then pick up a few things and sweep the middle of the kitchen floor, and say they cleaned. No, they picked up. They didnt clean anything. The counters will still be dirty, the walls have handprints and grease, the floor is filthy,  the sink is dirty. The living room has some clear space, but every bit of space on the mantle and bar are covered with crap. I hate that I never get to enjoy this place. They dont get it, they say I want it perfect, no I want it clean, not half assed picked up. I cleaned it on New Years Eve, they had people over that night and tore it to pieces, and have promised me every day since that they would clean it.Let me tell you its never been cleaned again. Yet they have the balls to ask me for food (out at restaurants), rides, bus fare, clothes, laundry money, a few dollars for a snack etc etc and think Im asking too much when I ask to come home to a clean house. They are home all day, every day. I go to work every day, to support their lazy asses. Yeah, I guess Im expecting a lot for them to clean up after themselves. They are ungrateful lazy kids. Devin had the nerve to get smart with me when I baby sat all morning they said they would clean when they got home, he sat his ass down and played xbox, then I was the bitch for reminding him of his promise. His attitude continued throughout the day. Sometimes I hate them..
