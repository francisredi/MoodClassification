Started off fine, but...
My day started off fine, but now I'm just getting agrgravated.
At one, .
I'm not saying I'm sorry anymore.  If I did anything wrong, then she can just go ahead and tell me if she expects any apology.  
The girl gets mad then decides to just ignore me and  and sit with her old Culinary Arts classmates who whine and yell at us just because Yoshi drums on the table at lunch.  I know once in a while that gets annoying, especially when you have no musical rythm, but instead of saying, "Damn, would you stop the stupid noise it's irritating the hell out of me!" they could have been a little nicer and said, "Could you please stop drumming on the table while we're eating?"  Is that so fucking hard?!  Augh, they annoy the fucking hell out of me!
So then I told them he doesn't have to since they had to be rude about the whole thing and that started an argument which thankfully didn't go anywhere because I don't want to embarras anyone.
So yeah we need to switch lunch tables so we don't sit next to them anymore.  

But I stand by what I said.  I'm not apologizing and I'm not talking to her.  She wants to be mad, fine, she can be mad for all I care.  But if she expects anything from me, she's gonna have to ask.  And if it was me that made her mad, she's still not getting an 'I'm sorry' out of me until she says what I did.  So yeah, just blowing off a little steam.  And I don't care, btw, if she reads this.  In fact, I even say hi.
