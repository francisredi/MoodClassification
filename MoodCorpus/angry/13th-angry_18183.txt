I don't understand why alcohol and pot and cigarettes are the status quo in weekend entertainment for so many of the people on campus.  I can't be at a concert when the air is soaked with the sickening smell of bad beer.  I have trouble understanding why people would start smoking, much less why they wouldn't try to stop.  What deficit of imagination does it take to want drugs to have a good time?

And I want to know why it makes me so goddamn angry every time I think about it.  We're not talking any normal anger here either, but a burning hatred at the bottom of my heart that makes me sad to be considered human along-side this wasteful, disgusting behavior.  I mean angry in a very cosmic sense

I can't do anything about it, but it affects the air I breathe, the society and space I live in, and people I love and want to respect.

When I feel this hopeless and angry about something, I generally take a walk somewhere and juggle.  That's what I'm going to do now.
