my whole existence is flawed/ you get me closer to god
Okay, I hate hate hate hate hate hate hate the Puddle Jumper. For all of its stupid and ostentatious array of bells and whistles, it is like driving a car made of Kleenex. 

You know when you're driving down the road and it's dark, and suddenly one of those "OMFG shootout!" Trigun songs come on, and you're driving all cool and suddenly some jerk pops around a corner with brights that lance through your eyes, brain, skull and soul, piercing the very core of your being. So, rattled, and leaning into the subequent curve, you realize halfway through that you're driving about 2/3 the metal you were before, and the car is like "Fwee! I can fly!"

Stupid-ass car. I can't get used to it!! It's like waking up and realizing that your body weighs about thirty pounds, so that every step you take is overpowered and propels you into walls and suchlike. 

When it comes to driving, my gods have very nearly let me fall, I think.
