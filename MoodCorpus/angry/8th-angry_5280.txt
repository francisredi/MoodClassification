so annoyed!
OMFG I am just soo fucking sick of everything.....Everyone is fucking pissing me off! They all need to learn to fucking chill out. SO sick of drama being caused, and having to listen to it. I just dont feel like doing anything anymore. I feel like just sitting in my room and watching the days pass. I am just really unhappy now. I HATE work, hate not getting any hours anymore. Hate the drama there. And oh god, school! I cant take that shit anylonger. I really dont give a fuck about my senior project with whatever I get. Just as long as I graduate and get the fuck away from those people. I Am supposed to love this last year. I really could care less anymore. 
  Matt's birthday party was ehh ok. Kinda sucked for me. Well cuz I had to get april and she was being a pain in my ass. I HAD To bring Brad along, he was soo fucking annoying, I swear he has to be gay, I mean he was singing to all these girlie songs. Then I had to get Amberly, she is soo dumb sometimes, she was like " Nick  Crists said he can give me a ride home" I was klike HELLLL NOOOO! Not the pot head! And then about hour and a half later I get there and five minutes later everyone leaves. I saw Rachel and Jamie for five whole minutes. I mean I know it wasnt my party and all but I never see any of them anymore. My rents were all being annyoing about it too. I was gonna not go get April cuz I knew this shit might have happened. Just ugh it was annoying period. Amberly  was all flirty with Mark which kinda bothered me. idk why but whatever. Matt wanted me to spend the night yeah right. Not with Scott there. He was getting annoying.
    Ugh I am just depressed I think. I really dont feel like anything anymore. Like whatever is my feeling.
