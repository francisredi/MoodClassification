Environment Hater
So today walking across the bridge from one campus to another talking with one of my classmates another BED major(Bachelor of ENVIRONMENTAL Design)... this kid in front of us cuts across from one side the bridge(next to the inside walking area) over to the river edge of the bridge.  Cigarette butt in hand flick right off the bridge... straight into the river.  I almost stopped walking.  The guy with me was like huh..  We seriously thought about throwing him over the bridge.  Now most people have a little bit of concern for the environment and at least stomp it out on the bridge in denial that it will actually end up in the river regardless but there is the chance that maybe the snow plow will take it way and it won't go straight to the river or they are even more environmental and at least try to find a garbage can or other such receptacle.  Nope this asshole straight to the river...  The guy I was walking with said "say hi(in reference to the cigarette butt) to the ducks for me".  What a jackass.  I'm so mad right now.  I should have gone up behind him and just did one of those Mom type slap right across the back of the head type things and said what the hell are you doing???  Moron.  GRRR so angry.  Okay so note to all people seeing this if you ever want to get on Paula's war path just throw shit right into the river with no care or regard.  HELLO I went to the Natural Resource college for 2.5 years.  I'm a Environmental Design major now.  AGH.  So angry.
