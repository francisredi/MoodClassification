Trafficky
I went to a potluck tonight.  I'm sure it was a good potluck.  I sadly only arrived in time to eat what I brought (by then only lukewarm) a piece of cold fried chicken and some really good french bread.  Here's why...

Last night I had prepared my dish and put it in the fridge with the intention of putting it in the oven when I got home from work and then it would be hot by the time I needed it.  It worked the last time I went to a potluck right after work.  So I threw it in the oven at 400 degrees and busied myself about the house.  I checked it a little bit later.  Stone-cold in the center!  I didn't have much time (did I mention the potluck was in Burien at 5:45pm and I live in Redmond and didn't get home until 4:30?).  So what did I do?  I put it the microwave to heat it up...a huge casserole dish.  Then I put cheese on top and put it under the broiler for about 5 minutes.  I rushed out of the house (forgetting my notebook of course, so I have to remember tonights lecture by heart).  It took me 45 minutes just to get to the I90 interchange on 405 south.  Traffic has NEVER been this bad before!  It took a grand total of 1.5 hours to get to the potluck.  I almost just stopped somewhere along the way to wait for traffic to alleviate and eat my dish.  I hate traffic!  Hate it hate it hate it!!!

Then on the way home there was still a ton of traffic, moving of course but I couldn't get away from cars on the road.  I'd pass one then another would appear in my blind spot.  tired of driving!
