fighting
Got into it this morning with my husband over the phone.  He said twice we shouldn't do this over the phone and then pushed to do it over the phone so I did.  He quit.  He quit being the parent of our son.  Our son is sixteen has rage issues and now a drug issue.  My husband says that he just needed a break, but both my son and I head him as "I quit! He is yours now!"  And this whole thing with my son has been almost more than I can bear, but you don't quit on your kids.  My husband's answer with each one of our kids has been to quit when they started becoming an adult.  When our oldest was becoming a man he spent months wanting to kick him out.  When our daughter was going through it with great difficulty he sent her away.  And with this son he has voiced over and over sending him away.  My son is hurt and angry.  As far as he can see John abandoned him and chickened out as a parent just because it got hard.  And I think he knew that violence wasn't going to work and he quit rather than finding a mature way of dealing with it.  When I voiced this this morning he attempted to slam me with a guilt trip to which I replied,  I am sorry we are dealing with this over the phone but I will not feel guilty for it.  My son's counselor thinks that John needs to come back into these issues with my son.  I think that John needs to know that he will be rebuilding a bridge that he burned down.  Because my son is not going to make this easy, he will fight it until John earns it back.  I just don't know if John can stay with it long enough to earn it back.
