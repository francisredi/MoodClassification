GGRRR!!!!!!
It's been one of those "I hate everything" days!  I hate that it's that monthly time where I gain 2 to 3 pounds all in one week due to eating so much chocolate!  Sure I loose the pounds the next week, but it's still depressing to gain them!

I hate the Navy's military health care system.  They're trying to screw around with mine and the kids provider assignments.  They claim that our doctor's panel is full.  So they're reducing the number of his patients...including both kids and I!  Well, we're all very comfortable with our doctor, and I REALLY DO NOT WANT TO BE SWITCHED!!!  So I've been doing the run around with phone tag with 4 different offices and departments today trying to get this crap settled.  I'm so frustrated.  All I want to do is talk to my doctor, because I know that he'd be more than willing to keep us on his panel.  But that's not the way that the military wants to work things.  You have to go all the way around the long way to get something, if at all anything, done!  And also on that note, I think that the military doesn't believe in "family practice" in the Family Practice Clinic.  Isn't a family physician suppose to see everyone in your family?  Well, my theory on the military is that they don't want you to have that family doctor relationship.  They switch your providers so much that you very rarely see the same doctor two times in a row!  I hate it!!!

I hate this patrol!  Sure it's nice having Jeff home, but it totally sucks on the kids parts.  They just don't understand about his schedule, and are emotionally a mess!  

My Sensaia party yesterday ended up having only 3 people show up.  And 2 out of those 3 are Sensaria party veterins.  

I'm just plain old EXHAUSTED!!!!!  I'm still not sleeping!  I feel like completel crap.  And od course, this doesn't help me in trying to stay positive.  *frown*  I just don't care anymore.  Whatever happens, happens.
