it feels like summer in auburn
ok, so is it sad to say that i would rather be busting my ass studying anatomy then finishing my world lit paper...eh, no. i hate world lit, but i will have the final draft for my dad by 7 am so he can revise it for me to turn it at 2 tomorrow. that means i will more than likely be up till like 3 am tonight, and then i will have to have very long tuesday and wednesday nights also to make another A on my anatomy test. it will be well worth it though, because 311 in Auburn Thursday night with Kristy, Meg (?), Lacey, Nick, and others...! yes it will be quite a wonderful end to such a shitty week :) 

so we are supposed to go eat at Mellow Mushroom tonight, however, nick is passed out on the couch snoring like a beast. i am getting very hungry though and i need a long break. i have been working since 5.

history test sucked. i hate the teacher and his tests...

as of now, in the fall i am sending nursing applications for Fall 2007 entrance to Auburn, UAB, Emory, Samford, and Kentucky. i will finish all pre req this fall and i will go ahead and make my minor in psych a major so at least i will have a degree at the end of next summer in case i never get into nursing school.. so yay for that! lots of choices and options. hate to leave Auburn though, but if i get a degree in psych here and get accepted to Emory or UK, i think i will definietly have to leave..

so enough procrastinating, im waking him up so we can eat!
