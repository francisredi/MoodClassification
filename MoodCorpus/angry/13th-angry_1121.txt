I really hate mondays.  With a passion.  But it's ok cause I hate a lot of things so it's not like its a big deal.  I'm really angry right now.  Every little thing is pissing me off.  Hmm... I think it's cause I needed to get out of the house and wasn't allowed to so now I'm like !*&!@#^*$ LET ME OUT!!!
So I just bought a new tee and purse.  I mean... I still gotta wait for it to get here (god bless the internet) but at least I won't have to carry around that ugly ragged green one for very much longer. Woot woot! 
And now I'm in the market for a new sweatshirt.  I was looking at the ones from interpunk but... I don't want a zip-up. OH AND My Chemical Romance's DVD comes out next tuesday. So I'm gonna be all spendy these next two weeks... not to mention that it's SOMEONE'S birthday next week (coughjohncough).  And St.Patrick's Day is on Friday and I still gotta get Jen her... thing ;)
I made my "life on cd" cd.  It pretty much epitomizes yours truly.  
So... you should post with a song (or songs, whatever) that when you listen to it you're like "ohmygah that's my life!".  Cause I'd like to know!
