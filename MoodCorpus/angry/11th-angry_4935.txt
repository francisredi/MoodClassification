appologizes for many swearwords in this post. but i am REALLY MAD
Never, EVER bring up yearbook with me unless it's a serious question about stuff. Otherwise, DON'T TALK ABOUT IT to me. It makes me SO VERY ANGRY. I was chipper earlier today. I was exhausted from a totally full day earlier today. Which consisted of go to school: ok until 3rd period. 3rd period was running around taking pictures and yelling at friends (whcih i don't enjoy doing). getting lectured by cooley on the wrong stuff. doing more yearbook. doing a test as fast as i could so i could get back to yearbook (i didn't study and was first to finish. not good). doing yearbook. more yearbook. then go to work and got off at 8. then things went uphill from there. THEN I ASKED HOW YEARBOOK WENT. THEN SOMEONE ACCUSED ME OF DOING NO FUCKING WORK ON THAT PAGE!!! FUCK YOU!!! YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW ANGRY I AM ABOUT YEARBOOK. HOW DRAINGING IT IS. I acknowledge that I didn't do anything on the page until yesterday. After that I'VE BEEN WORKING! YOU WERE ANGRY AT ME YESTERDAY FOR WHAT TURNED OUT TO BE STUPID REASONS. I DID MY WORK. THEN I WAS YELLED AND BERATED AT FOR MORE STUPID REASONS TODAY (althoug many were valid, the stupid ones bothered me). SO NEVER, EVER, (this is to everyone), BRING UP YEARBOOK TO ME EVER UNLESS YOU THINK IT'S IMPORTANT OR I BRING IT UP FIRST!!! OK?!!! OK!!!! I WAS IN SUCH A GOOD MOOD AFTER WORK. NOW LOOK AT ME!!!! 

... also, i now love Motion City Soundtrack.

... i'm SO angry. i'm seldom angry at anyone (except parents irrationally). so FUCK OFF ABOUT YEARBOOK!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!
