i just got raped
i'm such a ball of anger and hate.
today i had to turn myself in, because there was a warrant for my arrest. as if that wasnt enough, last night at midnight a cop showed up to my house and tried to take me to jail. a cop. at my house. at midnight. fuck that. i didnt go with him. so i went this morning around 8:30. they kept me in the mother fucking cell until 4:30 in the afternoon. i'm taking a nice little nap and i hear my name called. it's like being chosen first in kickball in 5th grade. i'm expecting to have to go through some huge process, since i had to wait 9 hours for this. they hand me a pink piece of paper that says i cant drink, leave the state, or have weapons on me until this is all settled and send me on my way. i about burned the place down. i waited 9 hours in  jail cell with dirty old nigs that smelled like sweaty feet for a pink piece of paper. oh but thats not all. so i leave the prison, go to the bank to find out what the deal is with all my money being gone. and lo and behold, they track it! guess who stole my money? a person went to an atm in a sears store in the COUNTRY OF ROMANIA!!!! WHAT THE FUCK!!! HOW DID A PERSON IN ROMANIA GET A COPY OF MY DEBIT CARD!!! i pissed a brick when they told me that. so tomorrow morning i have court for doing something illegal, and right after court i have to file a police report against someone else doing something illegal. the irony of this situation is making my head explode. this on top of everything else that happened over the last week. i should be a national hero for not breaking down yet. i havent taken me medicine for the last 3 days, because when i do i cant feel anger very well. and honestly, i really wanna be pissed off right now. i have every right to be, you know?
