Everything is about my sister
So, last night my youngest sister and my friend got in a fight. Apparently this happens fairly often of late. The two of them used to get along really well and now they hate each other's (Is that right? I'm not an english major!) guts. The consequence of this fight is that my friends, more specifically this friend, are about to be banned from my house. This is so typically my sister. She has everyone rapped around her little finger. Unfortunately, I actually see where she is coming from. My friends (or rather the two that she has trouble with) really don't respect her and they are mean to her and I should try and protect her more. On the other hand she isn't particularly nice to them and tries to control them and she does tend to channel the aspect of a female dog a lot. My family would be screwed up in a completely different way without her. I feel like this is getting somewhat incoherent and I want to stop thinking about this for a bit so I am going to stop now.
