When I was walking home this old guy was walking his dog and then the dog kinda came up to me and I was actually about to pet him but then the guy hit his dog and started yelling at it and I was like "wtf?! it's okay! He doesn't bother me" but he just like went off and so I was like.. uh. I think that's really horrible people shouldn't hit their animals. Especially if they didn't even do anything bad. There should be foster care for animals. Like when kids are abused they can divorce their parents, I think that there should be something similar for animals. 

I want to get Staz a kitten.

Okay so, for all you lame, stupid, annoying, lonely, horny, can't-get-a-girl older guys, don't honk at girls that are walking on the sidewalk. Just because I'm walking home doesn't mean I'm a hooker, showcase, or anyone that would even be interested in you at all. And honking at me and whistling is just going to make me curse at you, flip you the bird, and walk away. Especially if you're a gardener who is an illegal immigrant that never took driving lessons and would probably steal my money if you could.

I hate being in the middle of fights. Two of my friends are in a fight and all these people are taking sides and I just don't want people to be mad at me. So people are asking me like what the other person said and all this. I just don't want anyone to hate me for "betraying" them or being a backstabber. GAH.
