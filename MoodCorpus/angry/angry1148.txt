I'll give everybody a chance to watch Veronica Mars and Alias before I FREAK out and go on and on about them.. hehe VM!!! OMG!! *sigh* :x shutting up now.

ok and once again I'm complaining about Lost fans and Ana Lucia haters.. making any kind of hate thread regarding a tv show is pathetic, I don't care who it's about. and technically when you're saying how you hate the character, isn't that issue with the writers?? duh. since the writers..get this, WROTE the lines and the script ect, not AL or MR. and now with the MR drinking and driving thing.. that was stupid no doubt but if you want to make a list of actors who've done the same and much worse you're going to need a couple days to read it. I'm just saying. I don't address this at the 'lage cuz it will get you no where with all the angry 14yr olds LOL my FList knows what I'm talking about LOL just drves me nuts!! "I hate AL cuz she was putting a stick in the ground!!"  ooook and ya'll wonder why I don't go there as much jeesh. LOL
