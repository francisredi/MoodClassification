FUCK!!!
sweet so this will be the second time he takes shit and twists it to me talking shit about him. I seem to think this happened oh yeah not to fucking long ago. i guess he'll just never trust me. i guess i can't convince him otherwise. it took a lot to make him come to reason last time. shit. i fucking hate this. i might be loosing my best friend "again" due to shit that shouldn't be taken a wrong way. i'll fucking love him no matter what he thinks of me. hell last fuckin week i went over to his house at fucking 11 oclock just to hang out with him cuz i never see him anymoreck. and i don't want fucking attention. i don't give a fuck what anyone else thinks. i'm not trying to win anyones approval or get anyone to like me for something i'm not. I just wish he could see it differently. i swear to god i never said shit about what happened and if i did then let me rot in hell! well i have to try and stop thinking about it i have a big audition tomorrow but i know i'm not going to be able to think clearly. I just fucking hate how shit gets messed up for no reason. 

wish me luck i'm really gona need it now!!!

fucking hate this shit

every fucking day

something new

he'll never trust me

no matter how much i try and prove it to him

FUCK!!!
