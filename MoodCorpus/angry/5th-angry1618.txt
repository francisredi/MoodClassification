Pure anger
I just read that Alito will probably become our next supreme court judge.  I swear to you all- if at any point in our near future women loose the right to decide what happens to their own bodies- Jackie will go apeshit.  I will take a leave from absence from graduate school and do SOMETHING for the cause.  I just get so angry with politics! America is supposed to be all forward and advanced yet we've never had a non-christian/ non-woman/ non-white president while African and other "third world" nations have already elected women presidents.  And we're suppoed to be all "democratic" yet we'll arrest people/lock them up without legal representation and wire-tap them because we're fighting the war on terror.  What I want to know is, where the hell is this "Terror" place and why has fighting for democracy caused us to lose ours?!?  And gay marriage is considered an attack on "traditional" man-women marriage??  Oh, that's right.  I forgot that when 50% of people get divorced that's considered sacred and holy. And now the whole abortion debate has reared its ugly head.  It's not necessarily that I think they'll completely strip us of our rights, but I fear they will slowly chip away at abortion so we barely realize what rights we've lost until they're mostly gone.  

Damn politics- they just make me so angry!! Sorry for the rant but I swear I wish I was canadian!
