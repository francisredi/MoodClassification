fuck you!
I fucking hate my mom. She's such a fucking bitch you don't even understand. First, when I called her from school to come pick me up 'cause I felt like shit and was falling asleep in all my classes, her response was "No, I can't get out of work." And then I asked her if Charlie could come with us this weekend to New Hampshire for my brother's hockey tournament (keep in mind that I asked her on Sunday) and she was like "I don't know we'll talk about it." I was like alright whatever. So I ask her again on Monday and she was like "we need to talk about it" so I was like "well then let's talk" and she said no. and then same thing tuesday. and then when I asked her yesterday she said that we'll talk when she gets home from work. Well, when she got home, I was making dinner, and then after dinner she was in a bitchy mood, so we didn't talk until after I came home from Charlie's house. Well she finally said yes. and then when charlie asked his mom she said that he couldn't but if we had asked on tuesday then he would have been able to 'cause they made the plans yesterday for his sisters birthday party to be on Saturday. I FUCKING HATE MY MOM! and then, when I wake up today and have a headache and feel like I'm gunna upchuck, I can't stay home because my mom's a bitch. Again. I hate her! Oh well, the bells gunna ring so I'm gunna depart now. bye for now.
