Lets settle this....
First right off the bat, this is the second night that I had to climb into a dumpster. Macdonalds keeps throwing their trash into our cans. Then at the end of the week we have to get crap all over us because our can is full. Twice now I have climbed into a trash can and fished out Macdonald's trash and placed it right in their door. Also I called them after doing it, an punked out their manager. Anyone would have felt sorry for the lady, I smoked her bacon. But, that is not enough next time I'm going to toss it all over their parking lot, and into the playpen, also the roof. Macdonalds you are bitches. I'm Xopher Thibodaux Bitch! *slap*

On to less important business: What gives someone the right to get mad at someone because they reacted in a certain way, when everyone involved Knew how "The Angered Person" would react to such an aimed slap to the face. In a given set of circumstances, with mostly all of the set variables known, all of the steps set before you and you Know how I would react. Don't get mad because you set yourself up to fall. Don't get mad because I say the truth as I see fit. "No person has the right to say how anyone reacts to a given circumstance." Quote it. That goes down to the very core of personal sanction.
