Ugh.
Oh my God...

I just read a GQ article on Prussian Blue, the white nationalist 13 year old twin act. This is seriously disgusting. As much as I'm sure that, were I a 13 year old in the company of Lamb and Lynx, I'd punch their little pug faces in, I can't hate them. Oh, don't be mistaken; I hate their message, and I hate that they're described as "cute", and I hate the thought that this shit is being spewed in this day and age. It's their mother, however, that deserves the blame. April Gaede, AKA Satan with ovaries. 

This woman has been feeding her children neo-nazi clap-trap since the twins were born, filling their heads with ideas of a white nation and a misunderstood Hitler. I won't even get into the irony that Nazi scientists used to experiment on twins. She even named her youngest child Dresden. How fucked up is that??? And now the little Aryan brats are warbling their tunes of race war to audiences all over. It is disgusting.

Someone please, take me somewhere where crap like this does not exist. Prussian Blue doesn't want to share their world with "blacks, and Jews, and 'muds'". Well, I don't want to share my world with them.
