I HATE Mrs. Coulter!!!!!!!1
I HATE MRS. COULTER!!!!!!!!!!! SHE IS SO EVIL!  (really i should be blaming the people who think it's easily possible to find references for a SCIENCE FAIR project but i hate her in general so i'm going to blame her)  Anyway, I DON'T SEE HOW YOU CAN EASILY FIND REFERENCES FOR THIS STUPID THING!!!   AND THE REFERENCES I FIND I MOST LIKELY WON'T EVEN USE I'LL JUST GET THEM B/C I NEED TO BECAUSE IT'S A MAIN PART OF OUR GRADE FOR THIS!!!   SHE'S NOT EVEN SUPPOSED TO BE DOING THIS!!!  SHE IS A CREATIVE WRITING TEACHER!!! NOT SCENCE!!!  SHE CLAIMS THAT SHE IS JUST USING THE SCIENCE FAIR TO MAKEIT EASIER FOR US SINCE WE ARE ALREADY DOING IT? WELL, UMMM THAT PRETTY MUCH SAYING, "HEY I WANT TO BE REALLY MEAN AND TAKE ALL OF YOUR FREE TIME AND I WANT TO DEFEND MYSELF FOR BEING MEAN SO THEY WON'T THINK I'M MEAN AND GET ME ON THE BAD SIDE OF THEIR PARENTS"  (ok that not really it i eczadurated that a lot... but she is still the root of all evil)   she has problems... AND ANOTHER THING... SHE'S EVIL!!!!!!!!!!  I hate her.  but on better news later today after i am done taking my anger out on the keyboard by typing my intro fast, i'll put in a entry a nicer one more about what i wanted to say before i realised how stupid and hard it is to find even one reference...   check back later and see the happier entry... AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!
