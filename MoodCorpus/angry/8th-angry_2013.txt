So, I pretty much hate a lot of things right now.  But mostly that youth choir I'm in at church.  I HATE it.  Everytime I'm there, I get the shaft, big time.  Not only do they screw me over by refusing to let me sing anything on my own, (even though everyone else in the group has...), I'm the butt of every joke the little directors make, and the lady feels as if she needs to critique my every move/sound.  I really, really just want to quit.  I hate it that much...but if I do that, all the other little kiddies in the group will tell them that they hurt my feelings and then they'll just come sucking up to me...and I would hate that even more than putting up with their BS.  So I guess I'll just keep putting up with it.

On top of that, I smell absolutely horrible because I had to meet at Bonanza for my TR job tonight, and the food was really bad too.  Then there's the whole math/chemistry/spanish/psychology homework that I have to do tonight...in a half hour...yeah, screw that.  

I hate things right about now...life is pissing me off.
