i may have finally stopped crying, and i may feel a bit better after talking with my loves in my pledge class, but the tears are so close to the surface.  they keep trying to escape and i'm trying to fight them off and keep them in.  the stress finally broke through, and i need to find a way to patch the hole, or even thinking about pledging is going to make me a wrecked mess.  i just was reading what was written in my journal tonight and the waterworks just about started again.  fuck, i need to get myself together.  i mean, bonding is happening hardcore, but at what cost right now?  i know, it's all for a purpose, and i wouldn't skip it or change it because i know everything is necessary right now.  i don't want it to stop.  i just want to be stronger for it.  i'm finding all my strength right now through our pledge class.  i just hope i can keep it all and use it all, because i tend to break down randomly.  but the reason i broke down tonight was that i was alone without my mom when everyone else was with their mom.  so that pretty much did me in.  so maybe i am okay as long as we're together.  i don't know, but i'm stressed as all hell, and it doesn't help that along with pledging i need to figure out how to pay for school this month.  at this rate, i almost have to take a year off to make some money, but then i wouldn't get to keep my scholarships.  so i have to stay, but i can't pay for it.  exactly how am i supposed to do this?  i hate never having any money, and i hate going to a school that takes every penny that i have or will ever hope to have.  and damn, i have sorority dues coming up too.  i am so royally fucked.  but i can't think about that right now, i need to think about the two million and twelve things i have to do for pledging.  fuck.

why is it that so many people are able to pledge without a problem and the rest of us just fall apart?
