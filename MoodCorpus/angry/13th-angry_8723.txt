family is relative
sometimes i fantasise about hitting melissa so hard that she bleeds.  we don't fight as often as we used to since she has the height   advantage now, and it never goes very far because someone's always there to stop it before we get too hurt.  if we ever caught each other alone and in cross moods, there's no doubt in my mind that we'd beat each other proper.  there's a lot of inherent violence that hasn't gone anywhere for the past few years since i quit club soccer and she turned into a teenager.

the worst fight we ever had was a few years ago when she clocked me in the head with a wooden art supply case.  that effectively ended the fight in her favour, but i got sick from the bash and couldn't eat the next day.  

i really do hate my family, except for my dad and obaachan.  i still flinch when mum gets too close because it's just force of habit.  my granddad is a racist, hypocrite sukebe and melissa is a contradiction to every theory piaget ever introduced.  she's as egocentrical as a 2 year old with a temper to match.  

it is so, it was so, it shall be so

i wish they'd just die
