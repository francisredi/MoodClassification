So obvious.
So the phone rings and my brother answers it and he starts talking to this person for like 25 minutes.&nbsp; About random things, so I know its not one of his friends.&nbsp; He gets off the phone and I ask him who it is, and he said he had no clue who he had jsut talked to.&nbsp; So I start laughing hysterically.&nbsp; After he told me what they were saying, I realized who it was, but still how can you talk to someone that long and have no idea who you are talking to?
Yesterday, I went over to Ashley's to go sledding.&nbsp; Amy looked gorgeous in Ashley's snowsuit from like elementary school.&nbsp; It turned out to be quite an interesting time."I think I just peed my pants".&nbsp; I love those girlies.
Today is Christmas Eve:)I still have a ton of things to wrap sometime today.&nbsp; Christmastime makes me happy. And it also makes me happy that my voice is back.
Lately I've been talking to new people who I adore.&nbsp; Yesterday I got into a sad mood for quite awhile about something/the falling entry/ but now I feel better.&nbsp; But I can't wait for next week when everyone comes!&nbsp; But Manda and Jordan are leaving:(.
More later...
