thursday night was "date night" brian and i haven't had once since i was still in class (waaay before rotation started 8 wks ago!), so we decided to go out to the place we had our first date.  it was amazing, i had crab legs and steak and a delicious wine oh, and it was finished off by an assortment of sorbet and creme brulee...it was honestly the most amazing meal i have ever eaten.  the city crab is HIGHLY recommended hehe.  so then, he tells me we are going somewhere, but won't tell me where.  we get in a cab and tells them the empire state building.  cute, haven't been there in awhile.  we go, and there is NO line, it was great, we got right in and we were up there.  it was freezing, but amazingly cute.  he started talking about how the city is ours and how we go on the top of our apartment building to look out over the city, but he wanted to take me higher to see the whole city.  he went on about how he loves me and he's shivering.  i ask him if he's cold and he says he's just nervous.  i blow it off like okay, whatever.  then, he drops to a knee and asks me to marry him.  i start crying and of course say "yes".  we didn't notice, but there was a couple takign pictures of the entire proposal going down.  they are actually going to send us copies of the pictures! it was adorable.  afterwards, we went to central park, and he took me on a horse drawn carriage ride around the park.  it was cold, but there was a blanket so we got to cuddle up.  it was beautiful, i couldn't have asked for a more romantic and meaningful night.  we wound up back at home, made a few phone calls and opened a bottle of champagne.  it was the most memorable night ever.
