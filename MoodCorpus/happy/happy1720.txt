'Ello, 'ello, 'ello!
'Ello all! I, for some unexplainable reason, am in a good mood. It's quite unusual but I'm not complaining. I've been like this since last night. I stayed up til about 4:00AM writing in my journal and slept til about 3:00PM. Mommy didn't wake me up because she was napping downstairs. She slept downstairs too cos she's got a cold. I half hope I get it. I really want an excuse to use the Vics! It's one of my favorite scents, you know. OMG!!! Kronk's New Groove is coming out on Tuesday! Meaghan says that if I'm good she'll get it for me for my birthday. I really wasn't dropping a hint but she took it that way. Again, I'm not complaining. This week I am definitely going to finish painting my room. I'm debating on whether I still want to paint my furniture, though. I really don't know what of it I'm keeping. Well, my bed, obviously. And my nightstand. But I don't know about my dressers. Since Jess is moving in I'm not going to do my rec room. But Pish has ideas as to how I can still have a computer in my room. And I still get my chalk board. I'll need to get some magnets too so I can stick them on things. Yes...I'm also going to do some decorating this week. Mom and I are sort of wary about putting stuff up because we know that we just have to take it all down again. A few times, when we were little, we'd have decorations up til May. Cos Mommy would get really manic and decorate a bunch and then get really depressed (a few times going into the hospital) so we didn't take them down for a while. And without Meaghan here there's much less Christmas spirit. We'll see what happens. Well this is getting pretty long so I'll cut it short. I'll ramble on some more tomorrow or something. Ta!
