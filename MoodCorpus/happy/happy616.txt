Almost two weeks ago my son and I made a trip to Dallas together on a Sunday afternoon.  It was a special time for he and I to bond again.  We haven't spent much time together for many years, and even if I live with him, we still don't have all that much time together without the rest of the family around.  It was just a great evening together; wonderful conversation and the reason for the trip.  
My son is a composer, musician and recording artist in the Americana style.  Some refer to the style as Texas Red Dirt Music.  His professional name is Houston Marchman.  He had an invitation to appear on one of the great country stations in Dallas 99.5 on a 2 hour live broadcast with two other groups.  The DJ was a great and very interesting man calling himself the Wolf.  This program draws an audience of 1.5 million listeners. 
My son played three different songs all original during the 2 our show.  He played a new song called "Custer Died for Your Sins".  
I was really excited to hear this song for the first time.  It's about a Native American (Sioux)boy who rodeoed with my son when he was 18 or 19.  It was about racial injustice in Montana,
and about the eventual incarceration of this man.  The song will be released in a new recording sometime in the Spring.  I can't wait.
What a wonderful evening!  I am blessed every day to have my family around me!
