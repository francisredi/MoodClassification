Today I Am Happy
And, I was happy yesterday too.

It has been two good in a row.  Yesterday was the L2 Christmas Party, and that certainly was a blast.  I am going to have pictures on Facebook soon I think, but it was a good time.  There were lots of people who came, lots of fun, lots of talking, lots of happiness.  I liked being the hostess, plus, Laura and I did our hair all cute and I got to wear my favorite red sweater.  Very Christmas-y.

Today was CW layout, I think this issue will be a good one, and then the jazz dance!  I was way excited because Nate and I have been going to Swing Club, so we were excited to show off our moves.  But, there ended up being lots of people there and it turned into a huge dance party.  I was swept around the dance floor by Nate, Joe, Blair, and Eric, as well as some wonderful dances with my roomies.  The music was fun, everyone was goofy, and I felt really pretty :)

And the best part... I didn't feel bitter at all.  I'll be the first to admit that I am sometimes (often) known to be bitter with my roomates about our single status.  But tonight, I didn't care at all.  Even with all the couples being cuddly and kissy and stuff, I wasn't bitter.  And that was refreshing.

So, I am trying to not do anything that is going to make my happy glow from the last two days go away.  I'm trying to just be happy with now and not let it get lost in my potentially crazy week.  So, I am happy now, and I love that.
