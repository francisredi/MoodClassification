its a dream i had, drove me mad. its just your time, its just my fucking life
dude, i just dreamt of the coolest thing i have ever dreamt of. we were in kent but it wasnt set up how it is and we were all at the bars. (if youre reading this, you were probably in it.) but the girls were at one bar (like the loft crowd) and everyone else was at another (zephyr). anywhoo i was at the zephyrish one and decided to stop over at the other one and say hi, and as i was leaving to go back i walked outside by myself and this huuuuuge black and dark silver cadillac drove by and i thought it was gansters and i was going to be shot (haha) but it was kinda like those antique cars are geauga lake and there were no doors, just benches but no one was driving it and it was like a ghost car. it was seriously the coolest thing ive ever seen. it just kept driving past and i think it was trying to scare me but i thought it was too cool that i was just in awe. then i woke up. 
there was way more details to my dream like there always are but that was the coolest part.
also, i was carrying around a pitcher of beer my entire dream. its been far too long.
i havent seen anyyyyyone this week, so itll be nice to be able to play the next two nights.
i did kinda enjoy my week of seclusion though and im more than 250 pages into my book. yay for awesome romance novels, haha.
i bought a new candle today and it smells orgasmic.
im excited for all the stuff i bought myself for christmas, haha.
and even more excited for the christmas songs and commercials to end.
yea, ive got nothing else.
