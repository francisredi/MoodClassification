Christmas and such
Christmas was so much fun. Kaelin and I exchanged our gifts on the 23rd. He got me a big scarf that I have been wanting and then a set of Curious perfume with lotion and big bottle a little bottle and lip gloss. I'll never run out because my gradmother got me some too. Anyway I got him a sweatshirt and a t-shirt from American Eagle. After we did all of that we went to Ashley's house to hang out with some people. Spencer, Lacey, and Ben came and I talked to them a while. It was fun.

I got a lot more tuff that I was expecting for Christmas. I got an Video Ipod and a docking station so I can charge it and stuff. I got PJs, house shoes, and a matching bathrobe from VS that I asked for. I got some shoes and some clothes. Avery and I get to redo our bathroom!!!! Yipee!!! My favorite outfit is this zip up hodie from Delia's. It has two guitars on it and two shooting stars and it has sequins down the sides. It's really really cute. My aunt got me a huge make up case and a gift certificate to MAC. That was a really good present too.
I spent the entire day with Kaelin yesterday. It was really fun because I haven't really gotten to do anything with him since before exams. I got some music for my ipod from him. He's like a computer genius and fixed it and stuff. Then we watched a movie. I didn't go home until like 9:30. It was a lot of fun.
