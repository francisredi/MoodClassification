classy lady v. big old bitch
the person who gave me said classy lady watch has a ton of shit, and by a ton of shit, i mean she has a lot of stuff, and by a lot of stuff i mean she has a ROOM in her house dedicated to storing things like purses, clothing, shoes, make-up and jewelry.  AN ENTIRE ROOM!!

so, the person who gave me said classy lady watch has employed her work assistant to sell said room full of stuff on ebay.  some of that stuff is just UGLY.  it's so ugly i cannot believe someone shelled out the bucks to buy it just to turn around and sell it.  for less than what was it was paid for nonetheless!

BUT... the person who gave me said classy lady watch and i have the same sized fingers.  and the person who gave me said classy lady watch is selling her rings on ebay.  and some of you may or may not know i've been hankering for a big old gaudy drag queen ring like NO OTHER.

assistant girl of the person who gave me said classy lady watch was supposed to bring a BAG of rings to work so i could wear them and be all special and twelve years old, but she FORGOT.  damn her!  but then she remembered she forgot and employed her hot hot hunk of a whupped ass husband to bring them to her when they go out for lunch today.

excited much?  you know i am!!

alright.  i'm going to go through my lj archives now and make a list of songs i've listened to while posting in the past year.  thanks alot simplyesther.
