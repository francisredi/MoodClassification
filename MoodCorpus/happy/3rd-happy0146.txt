Christmas calm
The house is chaotic and cluttered and messy (moreso than usual, that is) but aside from that, I am feeling pleasingly domestic. This morning I popped out to the shops and I am now almost completely sorted for gifts. 

While I was out, I made a point of popping into the Manna House for bread. I have decided to try to get there at least once a week, and my modus operandi will be to start by enquiring what is still warm. Today it was a cereal loaf which I think actually surpassed the loaf I bought on Monday. There are lots of exciting looking flavours to work my way through, too, so I also got a loaf of onion bread (next time it may well be olive and coriander...mmmmm...).Am also feeling very smug because I was telling my mum about it and even at her incredibly cheap church-run charity shop they sell loaves of bread for 1.50, so the Manna House is indeed bargainous. 

I came back and listened to Christmas music while I wrapped gifts...and gifts...and gifts. I think I only have about one thing left to buy, though, which is good and I will hopefully get a chance to do tomorrow. Then I put on a Christmas DVD as background and washed the dishes. And now there is vegetable stock bubbling away on the hob. Tonight's tea will be a simple one of rich vegetable broth with pasta stars, good bread and butter, and I expect it will be a very nice tea too. 

Bonus things: I saw snow today for about 5 minutes (obviously timed leaving the shops just right), I managed to get the tape that had jammed in my car stereo out, and my parents' phone is finally fixed after two+ weeks of it being dead.
