BREAK!
Thursday- hung out with Miriam and came back to my house- played with Pierre-&nbsp;I got a smaller barbell for my bridge- watched the movie Elf- Miriam left, and then Sarah came over- we went to Mac's, saw Virginia and Rachelle there and we all talked, it was nice- no one was at mac's so we left back to my house- bleached my hair- talked about a lot of things
Friday- woke up, had breakfast, and we watched the movie Ice Age (it's so funny!)- went downtown to go shopping and pick up a few other things- saw Samantha in New Tribe and talked for a bit- came back home to get ready to go clubbing- me and sarah finally got downtown to hangout with Al, Stabb and Emily, also they had bumped into Neil and Alex, so we hung out with them for a bit- we walked all over downtown (it was quite cold)- Emily and Stabb left and we didn't end up going clubbing- we walked around downtown some more- tried to skate with our shoes at city hall, but the ice was.. barely even ice- we left to go home, after walking through the eaton center.SOME PEOPLE THESE DAYS, honestly, we say Merry Christmas to them and they don't say anything back!! HOW RUDE!
Today- woke up and listened to christmas carols- made christmas cards- and now I'm waiting for my cousins from Minnesota to arrive :)
I had an amazing past few days, and I can't wait to see you all again.I hope you all have a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!
