Blessed
We had a wonderful and blessed Christmas this year, if you want to see a few pics of our big day its on my blog. 
We have been getting Matt ready for his next deployment, I hate that he is leaving in 2 days for such a long time. Him leaving will never get easy no matter how many times or how frequent they tend to be its never easy to say goodbye to someone you love more than life itself. The last thing you want to do is tell that one person who you spend every waking minute with, every breath living for, and wake up every day gazing to their face goodbye. I am happy that we both have Laptops and he wont be standing in line forever to talk to us, well he might with the phones but as long as he has a internet connection in his room we should be set. There was actually a rumor that they had wireless internet down there. I seriouly doubt that but if so Yeah!
The wireless internet here in our house has worked out really  well too, the signal is amazing. I love the fact that I can be sitting in the living Room doing something on the internet while Matt watches something on tv that I dont care for like football or the history channel. And the same for him. He doesnt like a couple of my shows I watch, Bones and 7th Heaven.  I think I am going into VM withdrawl, I have the first season but love the new season and cant wait until it comes back on the 17th or 18th.
