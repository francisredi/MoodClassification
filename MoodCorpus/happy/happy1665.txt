It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
&lt;P&gt;It was a gorgeous and I do mean gorgeous weekend in Taos.&amp;nbsp; The weather on Saturday was beautiful.&amp;nbsp; I was in a skirt and flip flops.&amp;nbsp; The colors in the mountains were at their peak.&amp;nbsp; I hit my favorite little antique store.&amp;nbsp; Dinner at one of the best restaurants.&amp;nbsp; Plus, a weekend with great friends.&amp;nbsp; We had such a nice weekend!&amp;nbsp; I absolutely hate leaving Taos.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Especially the house that we&amp;nbsp;stay at when there.&amp;nbsp; I could stay there for months on end and be a very happy girl!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Then we drove home.&amp;nbsp; In&amp;nbsp;snow, rain, sleet and&amp;nbsp;fog.&amp;nbsp; It was such a stressful drive.&amp;nbsp; Especially when my husband and&amp;nbsp;Dacian decided they would ride their motorcycles.&amp;nbsp; It was a cold and miserable ride for them, but it was not much better for me due to worrying over them.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Today has been a cold and cozy day to be home.&amp;nbsp; I had hoped that my husband was going to be home all day with me and Sophie but unfortunately or I guess fortunately for him the power came back on at the office and he was&amp;nbsp;able to get into&amp;nbsp;the office&amp;nbsp;and get a lot done.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Meanwhile&amp;nbsp;I have spent another day with vendors, menus, budgets, and&amp;nbsp;wholesalers.&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I am not sure if it is the weather or what but I am really looking forward to Christmas today.&amp;nbsp; I have my list of things to get done for the holidays.&amp;nbsp; We are still (I assume) on a hiatus of major shopping for the holidays.&amp;nbsp; I use to love shopping at Christmas and giving gifts.&amp;nbsp; Then a few years ago I started feeling like Christmas had become an assumed way of doing things.&amp;nbsp; Now I like how we've made the changes for our household.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Christmas for my husband and me has become a time when we see our friends and family and just enjoy being with one another.&amp;nbsp; I'm looking forward to having the tree up with the new decorations my mom and I bought last month.&amp;nbsp; I'm looking forward to sending cards.&amp;nbsp; Baking.&amp;nbsp; Decorating mostly of course.&amp;nbsp; Even pulling out the Christmas china (which of course has been discontinued this year!!!!)&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;For today I&amp;nbsp;have to focus on my brides, my fundraiser and one or two major house projects.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With so much to do I am glad this is October and I'm in the mood for the holidays to arrive!&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
