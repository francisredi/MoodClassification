Going back to school...Sometime...
Well I have put in my application to go back to school and finish off hairstyling. Sooo I may be back in February or so (that is when I figure is the earliest a seat will be open for me to go back, more than likely in march though) So courtney I get to see you again!!! exciting isn't it, but no baby, Caleb is going to be staying at Jordons while I go to school. It would be just too expensive to take him out there with me and I would rather he stay with his dad than be with a babysitter all day and probably part of the night cause I am thinking I will need to get a job this time.I have no money to pay for school! I am hoping that I get funding from Metis for it (that way I won't need a job haha) but I am actually kind of excited to go back, I want to go back to school and I want to see people again.
Not too excited about having to live in residence again though, and who would be, but again it would be cheaper.

But but my cousin has applied to go out there for crane operator so we will probably be in there at the same time, that is exciting, I love him he is too funny, it should be a good laugh having him around to keep me company during intersession.

I am back home in Goose bay again though, that sucks, I am really board here, haven't done to much, I cut my sisters hair, colored mine, done a few peoples ahir for christmas parties now, and I went ouut an amazing one time to Joes house. Not too happy with adam because he has not phoned after he said we would go to the movie, tut tut. But everyone is going to be home for xmas soon, that is too exciting.
