semi '06
so semi, yea kinda sucked. well not sucked, but it wasn't as good as i thought it was going to be. i shopped and spent much money before going over to kaitlin's, then kirsitn put my makeup on and made funny faces in the mirror hahahaha good times. then kyle came before we were ready and the door came off and we changed in a room with wide open windows which is new for me but hey we're all hot so power to those who looked in
then we went to emily's house. there were so many people there so kirstin and i just went by the fire and of course the party came to us. kyle taught me how to play some song on the piano which i probably forget now. but it was a cute moment. then we went to semi, saw everyone, suz's hair looked freakin AWESOME because she is awesome like that. the dancing kinda sucked because they weren't playing any good songs so kirstin and i left early. this was the highlite of the night! we changed in the car hahaha foggy windows and screams of "i'm not there yet!" pretty much sum it up haha. hahaha dude, seriously...it was just funny. then we left to go to blue bell diner but since it's not a diner anymore it wasn't open but CHINESE FOOD WAS!!! so we got chinese food and while we were waiting took pictures upon pictures upon pictures. ok so maybe not that many but when the guy offered to take our pictures we were just like "um, no we're trying to take a longster but thanks!" hahaha then we ate the food in the car so it still smells every time i get in. then we went to andrew's. not much fun but apparently we didn't stay long enough for the real fun to start. if you could call it real fun and not "i'm in fifth grade".

so yea. semi. more like lame-i.
