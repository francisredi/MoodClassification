A.O.E. Semiformal
Saturday evening was our semi-formal for Alpha Omega Epsilon.  It was a blast!  We had two alumni (with dates) come, which is always fun!  The food was amazing, the set-up was very nice, the people (bartender, manager, bus driver, waitresses) were very pleasant and helpful.  It was all-in-all a fun time!

There were a couple rough spots though, we didn't have a bus until 23hr before we needed it.  I called EVERY place in the phone book when I found out that our original bus bailed out on us.  (We ended up getting a really nice driver.  He's a retired corrections officer.  We gave him a large tip b/c we were so grateful that he'd take us so last minute like that.) And, it was a diss to the music person that someone was skipping songs on the cds that took several hours to make.  (At least all of the music on the cds was good, Kerry's music collection is amazing!)  Also, it took a while for the food to be served because the cook sliced his finger while preparing the dinner of the party above us, so he was less nimble and slowed down.  (BUT, it was worth the wait, because the food was wonderful!)  

Oh, and my date (my little sister) brought an additional person--a boy--because someone else had canceled last minute.  It was fun to poke fun at her for being a pimp like that (and fun being able to interrogate the gentleman).  haha!!  

So, it was a great night!  I had a lot of fun!!  The alumni told me that they had a blast, and want to make it up in the Spring too!  Yaaaay!
