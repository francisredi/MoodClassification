And the days are gone...
So Christmas has come and gone. Very quickly, might I add! 

My family and I had a lovely day- four of us went to church which was weird, since Christmas rarely falls on a Sunday, and we had the christmas eve service the night before... My dad and I sang at the Eve service, Kourt sang with her friend Rob, Kim read scripture, and my mom helped my dad run sound/projection. We were a very involved family. 

We got to open presents soon after. I got what I asked for (yay!)- a swiffer carpet flick, lol. My carpet's always really dirty and the vac's at the dorm are poopy. So my 'rents got me a flick, and my sis got me a hand held vacuum, so I'm set! And very excited! 

Adam got me an aegean robe, which is super soft and pink! I asked for it, so he surprised me with a color- it's so pretty! He also got me goldfish and a gift certificate to a shoe store- Shoe Carnival. Yay! His parents got me a gift certificate as well to Younkers and some nice fuzzy socks, and his sister made me potpourri. They have a tradition that the elves bring presents on the five days before Christmas, and this year, the elves left me gifts too! His aunt, which I haven't met, sent me a huge fantastic smelling candle- his family is so sweet to me!

And today (the 26th) is our year and nine months, so Adam came over Christmas night to hang out. He works early, so he came when he didn't have to get up the next day. It was very sweet because he surprised me. Sort of. It was great! We also got to really talk, which was wonderful....I loved it!
