a witty subject
Well i'm being... persuaded to update my journal by my most awesomest and wondefulest girlfriend, Ashley.  Its been awhile, not that anybody but Ashley reads this anyway.  So lets see, christmas was cool.  I got a ninja giraffe, best buy gift card, video card for my other computer and some ram for it, and a cool dragon dagger.  And some clothes but nobody cares about that, lol, j/k.  So i get to force Ashley (against her will) to watch some anime with me sometime... but which to choose.  I'll think about it later, i just thought i'd say that.  Besides, ashley made me sit through her music so i get to make her sit through my anime!! (and btw hun... your music isn't bad, its just listening to music wasn't exactly keeping me awake, if you want you can make us listen to it in my car sometime).  Past that i got to spend some time with ashley, almost 12 hours! (well like close to 11).  They taught me to play yahtzee, uno, and phase 10 (yes i know i know, i'm a bum and a "sinner" for not knowing how to play those games... but dammit i can play a thousand other games!).  And we got to cuddle most of the night, now im just hoping i can atleast keep her past midnight on new year's eve.

On a side note, i had to reformat my harddrive to get my new video card working, so that sucked, but now it works like a charm so i'm happy, just hafta move all my music and stuff from my other computer onto this one (yes i have 2, and i built one! aren't you all... wait nobody else reads this... aren't you proud of me ashley!!!).

Well i think thats a good enough update, i love you ashley!!
