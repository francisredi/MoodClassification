Christmas Eve Day
Right now is the real Christmas Eve because it's actually daytime as I'm saying this. I know that I associate the following day after it gets light out, even though technically, everyone knows it starts at twelve. The world is so screwed up, at least in that manner. To say that the world is screwed up in general might not be true, exactly. Many people claim that it's true, but I think that there is still a lot that's all right with the world, and I mustn't doubt it all the time.
LJ has really helped me with the end of Chrissy's friendship. I don't know what I would ever do without you, because you're the only thing keeping me from not crying all the time, or calling him when I feel really lonely. You and candles. The delight in their glow makes me shiver with happiness.
Right now I relit that apple candle and I burned my thumb. The flame on the candle is unnaturally high, especially compared to when it was at my dad's. Maybe it has to do with the moisture in the air. 
I'm leaving in a little more than an hour for Coolidge Corner, but first I have to have lunch. I have to finish up the noodles my mom bought for me though, and I don't really want to because I think I cooked them all wrong. I've never cooked pan fried noodles before, and it's hard to get them out of that floury state and into that crispy one. I don't know how people do it, but then again, they have lots of practice.
I was just talking to Sean Creighton about some stuff, you know, a bit of small talk. I may have convinced him to make a livejournal, so he can talk about whatever he wants whenever he wants, and some people will listen. 
I get to see Connie and Jacob today while giftwrapping! Yay! Isn't that great? I have to admit I'm not spectacularly happy, but I'm sure happy enough to be able to see them.
All right. I think I have to go and get ready, take a bath and brush out my hair and eat. Then I'll leave!
I love the song "White Christmas".
Yours,
Shu Yi
