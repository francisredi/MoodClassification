The break is about to officially start
SOOOOO I've been on break for a few days but it's now about to "officially" start.  Tomorrow, I'm going up to OW on their last day to visit them in the morning from 9 til around noon or one.  Then I'm going to Tally with Evan for the rest of the day, be back some time that night.  Then I'm gonna come back here, crash, wake up, and go to Destin for the rest of the break.  WOO HOO!!!  It's gonna be a par-tay.

I'll be quite bored back in Destin.  Those of you who'll be home should come see me and hang out with me and whatnot.  Like I said in my other post I don't have everyone's numbers so it'd probably be easiest if you call me if you want to hang out.

What's everyone doing for Spring Break?
I know it's a bit early-ish to plan that, but Norman and the roomies and I have already begun planning because we have to plan ahead.  For those of you who remember the beach house; we're going to be renting it from my mom for Spring Break:-D  Spring break in Panama City.  It's going to be *AMAZING*
That is, if the rental agency hasn't rented the house out to someone else yet.  My mom's looking into it for us.  I hope it hasn't been rented.  If not, Spring Break is gonna be awesome.  If anyone is gonna be in the Destin/Panama City area during Spring Break then you could most def come and hang out at the beach house;-)
But I know it's a bit early to be talkin about the break.  But w/e.

I'm going to enjoy this break.  It's definately a well earned and much needed break.  Later all 8-)
