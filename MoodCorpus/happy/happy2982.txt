Rising from the Realm of Dead......
Hi everyone, hope you're all well.
I know i've been gone for sooo long lately as preparing for my o levels took up most of my time. Not to mention my parents had banned me from my PC after seeing my unsatisfactory trial result&gt;&lt; So going online to check my mail had become a sneaky business then.
Still, it's all over and i'm back again, after recharging myself for so many days of sleep deprivation. O levels are over, i could scream in joy^^ My mum kept telling me to get a job but i'm really too lazy to get one. I just polished my nails blue and mum was screaming at me for using such a terrible color and my violin teacher comments that i looked like someone who's been poisoned...! Still, i think it was a cool color ^_-
Amidst all this relaxing, i'm still quite worry about my result. Some of the papers are really difficult. Most people said that the trials are usually much harder than the actual exam, but the opposite occured this yearO_o Bad luck, i guess. Besides, now it's time to consider my career options as well, which is seriously bugging me. My parents want me to take accounting, but i hate accounts. I thought of doing engineering but dad says that girls shouldn't do that!Arggggghhhhhh! I'm out of options now&gt;&lt; So i'm thinking of doing A levels or South Australian matriculation first.
I've also been dling lots of manga recently, trying to catch up, especially Death Note. I've read up to chapter 90! It's definitely getting more interesting, Near is far more anaylatical than L. He's convinced Light is Kira. No matter what, i'll still root for Yagami Light to the very end. I really love this character, and even though it's rather impossible, i still hope that light can triumph over Near, lol^^
Well, that's all for now. See you guys around^^
