I FINALLY Got My Contacts!!!!!
I Love It!!! I Love It!! I really love having my contacts!!! LOL!! Okay I am done!! :) It is so nice not having to worry about my glasses. It is kinda weird but hey it is so... worth it. I got to the doctors office early and I got my favorite eye doctor Jack which made me happy! I didn't have to wait at all I got in right away!! He went over the whole speel of how to put them in and everything and then I got to put them in. It took me like 15-20 minutes to get my right one in that is becuz of my lazy eye. Then I did my left eye that didn't take me as long. I had to go back to my right eye and take it out because they are supposed to teach you how so I got it out and then I had to put it back in it took my like two seconds it was awesome!! It is just weird cuz I think I can see better with my contacts then with glasses. I got home and listened Auntie Mick blab on and on about how I am going to think they are a pain and I am not going to like them and all I can do is listen cuz I don't talk back to my elders. Out of respect ERG it was annoying!! I love them already. My eyes are irretated but I guess it is normal. I ended up taking them out and taking a nap I slept for four freaking hours!! I am awake and in a pretty good mood! LOL I better be. I took a shower and put my contacts back in. Yah That is my update of my contacts!!! I am going to go.. I will update about eveything else at school tomorrow during my break!!
