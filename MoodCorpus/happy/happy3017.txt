did i hit the climax of my life?
I just got back from T-town/Atlanta drive home. Ive been up probably 23 hours, but i dont regret it at all. The last 5 hours of the road trip were amazing for me. Probably one of the greatest times of my life. Most of it was me driving back to Mobile by myself. First at 4:55 am when i went to fill up with gas. I was hit by a breeze that wasnt freezing but soothing. But the background and all the surroundings just happened to quiet though, thats what caught my fancy. I felt like i was lifted off my feet. Better then any drug, sleep, or food ive ever eaten. Also along the way i met up with a middle aged dog, out in the middle of nowhere in the "back roads". He was just chugging along the road, like a galloping wannabe horse. So i stopped and greeted the brave stranger. Also i was pulled over for going 62 in a 45 zone, but once again i got off with a warning. The funny thing was watching, as a passing car wheezed by and my registration papers being flown from the front of the officer's car to the back, behind and underneath his car. Lets just say this police officer was not in tip top shape either, so it was hilarious watching him search and look for my registration papers in the dark with a flashlight. Also i saw the sunrise this morning and it was amazing, i felt like i was the only one getting to gaze at it b/c i was the only one on the road. Felt like it was only there for me and me only. Either way it made me feel like everything id ever done in my life, mistake or good choice, was the right decision. I feel like i hit the climax of my life. On that note, im going to take a nap.
