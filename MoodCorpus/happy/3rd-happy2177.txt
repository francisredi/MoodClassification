happy bday to me!!! and keith richards and brad pitt and spielberg and christina aguilera
Hey it's my birthday, bitches!!  Big 18 woohoo!!  Okay im over it.  Anyways.  My bday started out bad because we were in new jersey for this 50th anniversary party for my aunt and uncle which was saturday and we left sunday but found out when we got to the airport in philadelphia that they had changed our flight without telling us.  And we were stupid to begin with because we had flown from Providence instead of Boston so there were hardly any flights to Providence because no one cares about Providence (no offense to Providence people) so we had to wait around the Philadephia airport for awhile and then connect through NY and then Providence.  Then we went to Olives for dinner (not Olive's garden, Olives the Todd English restaurant) which was very good.  It's my grandfather's 83rd birthday today as well so my grandparents were there and my aunt, uncle, my cousin and his girlfriend came too.  Dinner was very good as was dessert, which included many different types of soufflees.  I made a really lofty birthday wish and I reeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaallllllllllllyyyyyyyy hope it comes true, but I'm not telling you all because then it definitely won't.  Wow...that was a huge bait.  Haha.  My grandparents are so nice.  For my birthday they gave me pearl earrings and a necklace, which was very generous of them.  Crazy.  Anyways...if you want porn or cigarrettes or driving between 12 and 5 AM let me know and I'll hook you up.  Hope you all had decent weekends!!! It's almost vacation!!!!!!!!  Only 2 more days!!!!!!  We can do it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
