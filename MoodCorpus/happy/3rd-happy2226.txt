I DID see Lex-mas because she taped it! Yay Luthor!Love
My sister graduated with a master's degree on Friday! Everyone clap for her. Mum and I attended, went to dinner, got incredibly drunk. It was fabulous. All went downhill from there and the trip ended today with a four hour bus ride sitting in front of the stupidest UT students ever and my (yet again) reaching the conclusion that, while I love her, my mother is a raging bitch. Dad and stepmom were properly amused when I regaled them with my stories. I'm so witty. 

Tomorrow I must both begin and complete my Christmas shopping because I have waited far too long and now I have to work the rest of the week because my crazy boss has me scheduled for the FIVE days before Christmas and not FOUR like I insisted. He's a wily one, my boss. I wrote him a reprimanding letter though, so perhaps he changed it. Otherwise I will definitely not be bringing bagels to work for everyone to enjoy. I alternately hate and love working the week before Christmas because it's so fabulously busy and no one gets anything done and Christmas is right around the corner and everyone is excited/irritated/happy/pissed-off/generous/harried all at once. 

I don't mind going shopping right before Christmas so much because I like being part of the whirlwind of the holiday rush. Everyone is dashing around, bitching about long lines, messy displays, and lack of help, but it's still fantastic because I can look at all the people in their pretty winter scarves and tights and the tacky Christmas displays. It makes me happy to be nice to all the harried retail employees who are getting their ears chewed off by insane Galleria shoppers and there's something nice about doing your shopping all in one mad day and having six million bags to drag out of your car. 

In conclusion: I love December!
