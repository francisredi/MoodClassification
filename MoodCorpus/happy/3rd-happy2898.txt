Christmas parties = awesome.
So, it's good to be home. Today was taken up by lots of fun stuff. This included:

- Visiting with my mom for a good chunk of the morning
- Lunch at a sushi place with my mom
- Walking around the mall with my mom and looking at headphones
- Picking up the exact right amount of Magic: The Gathering (Ravnica expansion) booster packs to give out at the party this afternoon
- Having a very quick orthodontist appointment where they literally threw out my old retainer case due to age and told me to pick a new one
- Going to  and 's place for an awesome Christmas party shindig thingy. :D

I got some very nice and thoughtful (Major kudos to  and  here, among others!) presents, and got to have a really nice afternoon and evening chatting with friends and all. Really enjoyed myself, and there's already some plans in the works for the rest of this winter break after folks get back from holiday trips. :) Gamers rock.

So, I'm just chilling out. Tomorrow is going to be pretty much all about relaxing, shopping a bit, and helping start preliminary work on the Giant Gingerbread House Of Doom, provided the plans for the house arrive tomorrow. (My half-brother drew them up with a computer-assisted drafting program and is FedExing them over, as they're too big for the standard 8.5 x 11 paper. Isn't that AWESOME?)

Really getting excited about Christmas. I'm hoping all my packages arrive in time. :)
