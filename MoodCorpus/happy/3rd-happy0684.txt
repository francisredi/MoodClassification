new friends
So today I met some terrific new friends. Went to a writing club hosted at Amazon Bookestore - not to be associated with amazon.com though there have been many lawsuits. The bookstore had the name long ago.
Anyway.
It was great. I met some wonderful women - a couple are very successful authors, two work for publishing companies, one is an agent as well as a writer - and the rest were just aspiring authors such as myself.
It was nice to get my mind off my disappointment about not going to hawaii. I need to get on with my life. And for once - when I got the text message but not followup phone call again today, I didn't cry. I am getting better. It will be awhile before i am healed up I think but I know its my fault. SO I'm letting him do it his way. I know he's trying to wean me away from him. I know I've hurt him so much that there's no going back. I know that I have to get on with my life. 
Anyway, I'm at starbucks again - one of my favorite places to play with my laptop - and I'm going to a play with Lillian in a half hour. I'm going to pick her up. New friend, I just met her today. I think she's gay but we didn't really discuss that. I'm excited about the play - "Arsenic and Old Lace" and Theatre in the Round on the West Bank. One of my favorites so I know I can talk intelligently with her afterwards. She is so intelligent - very high IQ, it's obvious. She's also very beautiful. Tall, thin androgenous... smokey eyes. I am wearing my new green/gold blouse and tight green skirt, I'm glad I kind of dressed up. I'm glad she had tickets - I have very little money right now. But we'll see.
I am happy.
The hole in my heart will heal right?
