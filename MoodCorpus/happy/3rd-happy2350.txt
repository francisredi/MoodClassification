reunions
Today was a fun day. Woke up with britt calling, well, I was already kinda awake, but it was nice to have her be the first one I talk to for the day. Got some food, took a shower, called her back and then just waited for her to get here. Cleaned for a bit, and then My MUT MUT finally got here. Her mom I guess wanted us to go with her to the cape, but I didn't want to not see my sisters today, so we stayed here. Brittany finally got here, we just kinda chilled for a bit. The sisters got here, helped them unload thier crap and then ate. Jess brought some christmas stuff for me from Abercrombie & Fitch. An awesome sweatchirt thing that I love, and a blue collered shirt, oh, and of course can't forget FIERCE!!! lol. just a cologne, but its cool. (currently on display to my right) lol. After dinner, chilled a bit more, watched the end to the lord of the rings, "A DIVERSION!" lol, I loved that part too, poor Orlando Bloom and his gay script... ANYWAY! Got Brittany home, Holly drove us since the mother is retarded and crazy, lol. Came home, and started on my paper, took about an hour for 3 pages, not too bad, mostly fancy BS, lol. And here I am now, just waiting out the rest of the night and then gonna go to bed.
I have such an awesome set of 2 1/2 weeks ahead of me, but unfortunately I still have to go christmas shopping. I hate procrastinating, but I guess it's in my nature. Then I get to see MUT MUT as EARLY AS WEDNESDAY NIGHT!!! lol. and then we're inseparable for all of vaca, awesomeness. I can't argue with being with my love for the holidays, and I can't ask for anything more. I love my brittany so damn much, and I wouldn't even trade her for a second life. 
"Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, LITTERALY give an arm for?"
Thats you Britt, <4+2/3

Good night all!~
