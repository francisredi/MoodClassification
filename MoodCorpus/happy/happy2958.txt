Time for something new!


Hehe i finally went and got a tattoo which i have been wanting since i went on the acne medication but couldnt get one due to my skin being to dry and peeling. But now at least i got one! and it didnt hurt as bad as i thought it would the outline was nothing compared to the actual shading! and i know the pics arent the best coz its hard to see but it was a self portrait hehe so i guess its pretty good for self shots! 

I guess your wondering why i chose the sun with flames coz it was the symbol of this video game character i like hehe so i thought it would be cool even tho the tat was abit pricey but meh i got a bonus at work so i thought id treat myself to something special and do something different! hell i might even get another done in the future.

My mum wasnt to happy that i had got one seeing as she thought it was ugly but anyways i love it and my dad didnt say much about it which i expected and i expected my mum to kinda leacture me about it which is why i didnt wanna tell her in the first place but anyways its already done and i wasnt gonna tell my parents until later well it was when i showed my sis that she opened her big mouth so i had to show them

Anyways here is 2 pics i took of it i know you wanna see how it turned out, im glad the bleeding stopped well it was only the first day that i got it which was last friday and now its all fine and it didnt even go red
