I Am In Complete Shock!!
David just stopped by for a few minutes.  He was on his way to the recruiter's office and wanted to drop something off to me.  When he walked in the door, I noticed he had a basket in his hand filled with all kinds of goodies.  I asked what "that" was.  His answer shocked the shit out of me!  He said it was a congratulations gift basket from his parents to me.  Apparently he told them of the engagement last night during their Christmas festivities.  They were happy for him.  What shocked me the most is in the 11 or 12 years I have known David, his parents have never met me.  Not once!  The fact that they would give me and my son, by the way, a gift having never met me is in and of itself something incredible.  Everything about this whole thing has just seemed to fall into place.  Everyone has been really supportive.  He was going to wait to tell his parents until he got home but said he was going to give them a few months to think about it and went ahead and told them.  I've decided I am going to write them a letter of thanks and return a picture of Shawn and myself in one of the photo frames they sent as a gift. I want it to be personal and intimate.  

I am going to miss him dearly.  Already I feel the pain of his absence.  Knowing he is going to be gone for a while hurts.  I am also scared to death.  Last time I was this happy, it ended in utter tragedy.  I am scared it is going to happen again.  I know, I know.  I cannot think about it like that.  So I will not.  I do not have his parents address so when I talk to him again, I will have to find out in order to send it.  

This is all happening like a fairy tale to me.  Once again, my life seems to be fulfilled and happy....
