Bouncy! Bouncy! Bouncy! Bouncy!
Montreal!  Tomorrow!  Cya latah suckahs!  I always HATE the night before I leave for Montreal.  I can never sleep.  Then the next day is utterly exhausting as I spend 1/3 of the day travelling.  Then I get there, and despite the fact I should be tired for not having slept properly the night before and travelling all day, but all of a sudden, its like snorting a bag of coke (not that I know what thats like.  My nose is for air only thank you very much) I get all bouncy, and I even out last my friends up there.  In the end it works out because all that leads to me being able to sleep allright despite the fact Im not sleeping in my bed.  You know... when you travel and you have a hard time sleeping in an unfamiliar place (a mental condition we gave ourselves if you subscribe to evolution) that is just utterly gone cuz by the end of all that Im too tired (and drunk :P!) to do otherwise.

And I guess technically related to Montreal, Vince McMahon and Shawn Michaels kicked off the "Storyline", that will bring Brett Heart back into the WWE, even if only for a little bit (related to Montreal because the big Brett Heart deal happened at Survivor Series in Montreal for those of you who dont know).  Last I heard he cant wrestle for extremely serious health reasons.  Namely something like a concussion and a stroke mixed together.  But its exciting none the less.  To see something thats had 8 years of build up be resolved... even if its not in a full out match, will be exciting.  Then again it could be the hugest dissapointment ever.  However I think the WWE would have to try real hard to fuck it up.

LOL I love Randall.
