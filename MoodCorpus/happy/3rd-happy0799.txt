* Saturday ! *
What a lovely day !!!  Im about to take a very, very, long, hot shower.  * sigh * that sounds like Heaven, dosen't it ?  * smile *  

I spoke to lil ryan yesterday evening - so now I have two western unions to pick up !  * laughing *  I caught lil ryan spending his dollars on something he should've been - * tsk tsk tsk *  but he's addicted - he knows he cant stay away.  he loves being owned and controlled by ME !  I webcam'd with My NYC boy - such a fucking hot bod this one has on him - and in more ways than one !  lol  we had a long session - very satisfying for him - and of course made MY pockets fatter ! * laughs *  

I spoke to My dominick today as well - he's having a hard time right now - and we had a very honest and open conversation.  I do enjoy getting to know each of you.  it opens up all sorts of different lines of communications, ideas and thoughts.  keep that in mind - losers !  but, even with all that he is going thru right now - he spoiled ME very very well - with promises of having a splendid Christmas and Birthday from him - I cant wait !!! * smile *

little eddie got his surprise in the mail today * grin *  as I predicted - completely and utterly under MY spell - I've assigned him a special gift to buy for ME at his leisure.  its on MY wishlist  !!! and this goes right into what I was up today -  I went shopping - AND - We bought a new * sony * wega, LCD, Hidef TV !  its Gorgeous !!!!  Merry Christmas to ME !!!  YAY !




so the gift that I am having little eddie buy ME is the sony lifestyle - which is a hard drive computer that hooks up to the tv and a wireless keyboard !!!  We shopped it at the SonyStyle store last night - and THAT is what I want !!!!  * giggle *  YAY for ME !

I did take some new photos yesterday and if I have time this evening I will be sending them out in pay per view mails for Niteflirt/Keen.  I may not get to until tomorrow though !  so be on the look out!  if you want to be put on the mailing list - email Me on KEEN to :TheAsianGoddess - and request to be put on MY list !  It really depends on how much time I have tonight though - My david is out running an errand for work, and will be home any time soon - tomorrow afternoon he leaves until Tuesday - so I'll be online around 5pm central if not sooner.  * smile *   

8 days until MY Birthday !!!!  ( My fathers Birthday is tomorrow ! )  Remember to VOTE - Vote - VOTE !
see ya suckers !
