Another present at Borders: A chock full of old American tokusatsu magazines!
My friend Greg at Borders (same guy who gave me the Godzilla Poster Collection) gave me a whole bunch of old magazines he still had laying around in his house, and thought I should have as a Christmas present!  All nicely piled in a plastic bag!  Here's the following mags:

-Japanese Giants # 7
-Markalite # 1 & 2
-Animefantastique # 1, 2 & 3

Although I already have said issues of Markalite, these new ones are in excellent condition!  The ones I have are getting VERY worn from extensive past use (and that I loaned them to a friend of mine once), so I'm very glad to have spares.  Although now that I have new Markalites, I'm thinking of giving my old ones to a worthy family scion (possibly my nephews, though this could change).  I'd rather create new fans, especially in my family, than just give away some of my holy bibles to some collector who's not going to do anything with them but, er, well, collect them.  In other words, I'm not about to give them to Comic Book Guy from The Simpsons.

I was showing Markalite # 1 to Darryl, who was awestruck!  He was amazed at the stuff in the magazine, especially the Sonny Chiba article!  Then, I quipped, "Now imagine me reading this more than 2 years before Power Rangers ruined everything!"  Darryl laughed and said "Oh, man, I'm so sorry!"  Now you know.  :)

But I was impressed with Japanese Giants, especially its coverage of G84 and Atragon (despite several errors in spots)!  This particular issue was from 1985 (and in surprisingly great condition for newsprint-ish paper!), so it's amazing to see how fandom was back then!  (And I was a mere 10 years old at the time!)  I really have to get more issues (Yes, Ed Godziszewski still makes them!). I need SOME magazine in the mail to cheer me up on a drab, boring day (like Oriental Cinema and G-Fan, when that was good).
