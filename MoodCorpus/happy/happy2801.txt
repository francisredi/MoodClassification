Saturday Out
COOL FUCKIN' SATURDAY! Ok, so the day started off not so well - I had to wake up. But after that, it was all good! Bryan started it off by sneaking out to get Chic-fil-A cuz he knows I love their bagels. YUMMM. Then, we ended up back in bed until around 2pm just snoozing and cuddling.  Finally got up and played on the computer for a while. By 4pm, neither of us had YET to have a shower. LOL  Got showered up and killed some more time playing on the computers before heading out to dinner to meet up with some bears Bryan met on-line. 

So we make our way down-town to the restaurant to meet up with  and his hubby from East Ridge and some of their friends locally. There ended up us,  and his hubby, (VERY cute), (HOT), a bunch of other bears / chubs / chasers (some very cute), and one very nice lesbian. The food was great and the company was a blast. After dinner, Nick & Kenny (the boys from East Ridge) headed back to their hotel to freshen up before heading out. Bryan and I decided to hang out with some of the others and headed over to Miss Q's. (For those that don't know - and I was one until tonight - Miss Q's is a gay pool hall!! FAB!!!) Me, Bryan, Ricky, Bill, John (, Trish, and Ray () hung out and played pool for a while. Bryan and I SO suck at pool. Anyhow, after that, John, Bryan and I all ended up going on over to the Eagle while everyone else ended up over at Red Chair.

Met up with Nick & Kenny over at the Eagle and also saw  and got a nice hug. I left Bryan to fend for himself and headed out to the dancefloor. I had a great time just dancin' like a fool and looking at all the beautiful men around me. Once I decided I couldn't go on any more, I went and collected my husband. We hung out a few more minutes and decided to call it a night. We said our goodbyes to everyone and headed home and here I am now!

Now, to shower and get the bar stink off me! Who wants to help??
