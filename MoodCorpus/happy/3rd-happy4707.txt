Round 1 & 2 of Christmas
Round 3, 4, &amp; 5 are coming soon.
Round 1: Me and KyleBeing at home on Christmas for the first time without mom and dad wasn't as bad as I figured it would be.&nbsp; I didn't have an emotional breakdown yesterday like I thought I might.&nbsp; (I took care of that on the day before Christmas Eve. :o)&nbsp; We had a lovely little time opening our gifts to each other.&nbsp; From Kyle, I recieved: tarajacksononline.com, the internet at home, a $50 Ann Taylor Loft gift card (my new favorite store b/c they have petite clothes), special edition Cinderella DVD, and my pride and joy: the Wolfgang Puck reversible (and dishwasher safe!!!) grill/griddle.&nbsp; To Kyle, he received: Sirius Sportster satellite radio receiver, plus a year's Sirius subscription, 2 Fossil reversible belts, and the 70th Anniversary edition of Monopoly.
We then headed to church, and went through all of that.&nbsp; Came home, changed clothes and headed out to Lebanon for Round 2.
Round 2: Me, Kyle, Paul, Deborah, Daryn, and Alex (with gifts from Betty and James)We had a lovely Christmas lunch that Deborah fixed.&nbsp; Quite yummy.&nbsp; And it's always a brillant idea to have a ham from Honeybaked Ham; nothing better!&nbsp; Now that I think about it, there weren't any mashed potatoes(!!!), but I'm sure we'll get some at Mom and Dad's.&nbsp; Anyway, from Betty and James for me: an old-fashioned sifter (which was really cool that she remembered I wanted one of those), money, cookies, gloves, and hershey kisses.&nbsp; For Kyle: a soccer ball piggy bank (so cute), work gloves(??), money, cookies, and hershey kisses.&nbsp; From the Jackson Fam for me: special edition Annie DVD (!!!!!!!!!), and a $100 gift card to the mall.&nbsp; YIPPIE!&nbsp; And for Kyle: the Batman Begins DVD, and a $100 giftcard to the mall.
All very exciting indeed!&nbsp; Oh...I forgot about the lint roller brush, $20 (each), candy, and photo album from G'ma. :o)&nbsp; It's always stuff that we need, seriously.
I'm excited about getting to see G'ma and Aunt Lois on Wednesday, then having Christmas with Mom and Dad that night.&nbsp; Not too much longer!!&nbsp; Just have to get through a day of work tomorrow (boo hiss), and then headed out there.&nbsp; Of course, I'll be tied up with stuff dealing with Suz's wedding, but I'm also excited that we're (hopefully) going to see Bryan and Banae while we're down there!!&nbsp; Very exciting.&nbsp; And Kyle's okay with that b/c now, since he has satellite radio, he won't miss his football games. ha ha ha. :o)
Well, I sure hope everyone had a lovely Christmas!!&nbsp; Now, time to get ready and go join the rest of the people out at the malls!!&nbsp; Yay!!&nbsp; Let the excitement begin!
