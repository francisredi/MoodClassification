I <3 the holidays
The past few days were great, I spent them with my family and John. I couldn't be happier and more excited. I got a ton of great stuff for Christmas: Motorola cell phone, big bottle of Dior Pure Poison perfume, pretty windchime, pretty jewelry box, classy black leather tote bag for teachering, gorgeous heavy Victoria's Secret robe, VS thongs, two 14k gold belly button rings, Avon stuff, bath stuff, soaps, spatulas, crest whitestrips, socks, two posturepedic pillows, alison krauss & union station live 2 CD set, gas card, waldenbook/borders card, candy, food, candles...and other small stuff I can't think of because I already put it away.

:) And I think everyone liked what I got them. Yesterday John wore the polo shirt I got him, and it looked nice on him. My family seems to like him more now so yesterday went well and it was fun. John was really nervous to spend Christmas with us because he is trying to make a good impression on my mom and dad. And I think they like him, and hopefully will come to realize that the age difference is not a big deal. He may have 15 years on me, but we are both adults. I'm just at a different part of my life than he is, but we really balance eachother out and just fit together very well. It feels so right and we couldn't be more excited about starting a life together.
