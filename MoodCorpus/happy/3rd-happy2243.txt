i agree with aristotle now:
the end towards which we all strive (despite the various ends we may claim to have)is happiness.

a gentle lifting of the spirit, a quiet exuberance, something that glows on the face and when gone, makes it a shadow.

i'm in boston now, and i can't stop smiling. yesterday, mom and i drove to concord (home of thoreau, louisa may alcott, and walden pond) where we had a lovely lunch and wandered among the boutiques of its snowy streets. just driving there through the woods, every house with wreaths, and candles in the windows, the road twisting along past frozen streams- my mind quaked with its elation. 

that afternoon, she dropped me off at brendan's cozy 9th floor apartment in cambridge. oh! we hadn't seen each other in months. we just stood on his doorstep for a few moments, wrapped in each other and grinning like children. over the evening, we'd cast sureptitious glances at one another and break into laughter... 

later, we went to emerson to see his short film, 'feedback,' in a festival. then we walked across boston common, on pathways lined with lighted trees, past frog pond and the swan boats, to newbury street. it was about 10:30 and the stars were out. there was a light, cold wind and our feet crunched through the snow in synchrony. he took me to dinner at a grand little indian restaurant called kashmir and,

i just wish life could always be this infused with joy.
