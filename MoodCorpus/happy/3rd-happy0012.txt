Happy Birthday !!!
Since I won't get to see you for a couple of weeks, I'll have a drink to you tonight at the Mercury Lounge with Christina and Rishi!  That is of course, if the strike didn't happen and I suspect it did not or it would have been in my face. What a scary thought, I won't be able to celebrate 's bday if there's no subways and buses! 

Mike, you've been such a great friend me. I appreciate how well we got to know each other of the past year. You're awesome. :) This has been a good year for you instead of just becoming a closer friend to H. You've just finished the (F)MLIS! Congrats. It was a huge non-event for most of us, but still deserves a celebration! You moved to Seattle and started over fresh to start a new masters program (I so admire you for it, even though it means your 3000 miles from me instead of 20). You got engaged to the girl w/ the purdiest eyes in the whole world who can make the best plantains among other delicious dishes.  You continued to develop Lack of Talent into the superband that it is now! I'm sure there's more... overall I'd say you made 31 look so good. I'm not afraid of being over 30 now! (but thank the flying spaghetti monster that I have some time tp prepare for it!) Hope 32 is even better... and I imagine a couple of events in the beautiful month of june will help!!

We have about 15 LJ friends in common --- so I better see some HB's for you below!!! :D
