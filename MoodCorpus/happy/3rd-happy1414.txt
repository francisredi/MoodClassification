Resurrecting an old post because it's the holidays and it's funny
Hello again everyone I'm Lance winkenblinken with Internet Action News. Santa has once again come under attack this time from his east coast rival in the north pole Frosty the Snowman or as he is sometimes known as "Mr. Friggidpants". Eyewhitnesses say, "Mr. Friggidpants" was driving his S.U.V or Snow Utility Vehicle around the parking lot of the elves at the north pole factory for children when from the back seat of the S.U.V an as yet unknown assasin opened fire with a snowball version of the A.K. 47 injuring several elves and whacking Santa in the nuts. Fortunately no one was hurt as the elves ducked behind Santa who had put on his everlast steel underwear just in case something like this would happen. The previous week we braught to light the mystery surrounding Frosty's stolen gold plated bling bling snowmobile and that there were no leads in the case of the missing recreational vehicle but some in the F.B.I are questioning santa once again about it concidering the events that have occured just today. Hostilities began between these two winter icons when Santa, wishing to appeal to an older audience who claimed they no longer believed in him released a gripping gangsta rap album entitled, "Santa, King of the Bling." Shortly after Frosty the snowman changed his name and released a counter album entitled, "Santa's a *bleeped* yo!" That's all the news we have at the moment but please stay tuned to this station for further details. I must say this event makes this reporter wonder just how far this will go? Will we see another east coast west coast war, this time waged upon the frigid ice and snow where no one gives a shit? who knows, But damnit I love watching elves get snowed! I'm Lance winkenblinken.... Goodnight.
