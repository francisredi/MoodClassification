Christmas!
Merry Christmas everyone! I hope that somewhere a few people had a white Christmas! Here it's gray, foggy, and wet. There had been snow, but it melted about a week ago and everything is still soggy.

Well, this morning was definitely a very different Christmas morning at our house. Usually we have to wake our parents up at seven, but when I got up at 6:15, my dad was already awake! And then when I was brushing my teeth, out walks my mother. So, we got to start opening presents about an hour before we usually do! But it was awesome.

I know it's kinda cliche, but I generally like to take a little inventory of what I got. Most of what I got was Bath & Body Works stuff. Don't get me wrong, I like the stuff, but there are other things I like, too. Anyhoo, the coolest thing I got was a guitar case and new strings and bridge pins for my acoustic. I've had it for like six years but never got serious about it. This time I am, and I'm going to start learning. I tried to put the new strings on it, but I broke the first string, so I'm going to have one of my friends here help me. I can't wait to start practicing and playing!

Other than that, I start cooking for Christmas in about an hour and a half. Should be good. We're going really simple this year, just a ham, potatoes, carrots, and fruit. I think there's something else. I don't remember what though. 

Anyhoo, I hope everyone has a merry Christmas! Blessings!
