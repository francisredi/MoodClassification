ahhhhhhhhhh
Heck yeah i did it! Two nights in a row i freaked out and two nights in a row i performed and i did..pretty good, i guess. =D BUT I DID IT! THE PERSON WHO IS TERRIFIED OF SPEAKING IN FRONT OF PEOPLE GOT UP AND ACTUALLY PERFORMED A PLAY IN FRONT OF..well..people..*laughs*. AND I WASN"T SCARED! 

Okay, so i was scared like 5 hours before the play and right before i went on stage i was flipping out (alex had to calm me down alot, i love his so much, ALL of my friends helped me...i'm SO grateful!) I had a lump the size of Cali stuck in my chest and could barly breathe right before i went out onstage. But after that, after i started acting of course, I felt SO comfortable and it was A LOT OF FUN!!


AND i had a fencing tournament today and I placed 5 out of 10, which is good! I think it is anyway. =D

Heehee, anywho it's like 2:08 AM and I reeeealy need to get to bed now. =D I'll definatly update more often next week (because we only have one more week of school left and then we'll be OFF for Christmas break!) YAHHHOOOOOOOOOOOO!!! I only need to get through this week of horror and then it's freedom! Me and Alex ca go to that dance and everything! Ohhh, I can't WAIT!*girlish sigh*

"Oshidori, be quiet!" Ohhh, I LOVE that line...man I am going to miss that play, I had SO much fun! 

I might be trying out for the other play, I don't know yet. =D

p.s.-isn't that a neat name, it was my name for the play 'The gift of Tenyin' Tachibana, means "Orange Blossoms". Isn't that COOL! ^_^ I'm SO happy! *laughs*
