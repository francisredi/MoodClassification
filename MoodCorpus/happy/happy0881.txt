New furniture!!!
Our new living room set arrived this morning! The furniture is so nice! I'm very happy with it. :) It's nice to finally get rid of the college garage sale furniture and get nice new stuff. It's so soft and fluffy. The pups love it too. They've made themselves right at home on the piles of pillows. The couches came with a bunch of big fluffy pillows, and I threw the old ones up there too, so there is a big mountain of them. We also have two end tables not instead of one, and they are higher, so it's easier to rach over and get things that are set on them... AND they have DRAWERS!!! The new coffee table has 4 little drawers on the bottom and the top lifts up to hide little compartments  for the wireless X-Box controllers and the remotes, and whatever else we want to hide in there for easy access. Since we often take our laptops out to the living room, it would probably be a good place for mice and stuff too. The nice part about the top lifting up is that it doesn't just raise like a lid. It's on a hinge system that raises it up level so you can use it as a raised table. This means if we are sitting at the couch, we have an elevated surface for our laptops and don't have to hunch over. Although, I usually like to put mine on my lap anyway. :)

After Glenn gets home from his weekly flag football game, we're going to get cleaned up so we can go shopping. We were invited to a private party at a club in Pointe Orlando that hasn't opened yet. One of my friends knows the person having the party and got us on the guest list. The place is called POSH. It's a nice event, and I actually have to wear a dress! Anyway, to get in, we just have to bring an unwrapped toy to donate, so we're going to look for some toys to bring, a DVD for the office DVD exchange next week, and some sparkly black heels for me to wear with my dress. 

I hear the garage door. Hubby is home!!!
