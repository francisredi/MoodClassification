tie me up! untie me!
i just realized today that i cant tell if i have changed that much really.  have i? i look at myself in the mirror and i dont think that i have evovled in any way, shape or form.  every one seems to be changing so drastically, yet i remain constant....is this a good thing? does this mean anything at all.  Or have i infact been evolving all the while and have just been unaware? i have no ideas about this. The matter is in these past few days..well as christmas is approaching and all the bussiness is coming....well i dont really think i need anything this year at all for christmas. anything.  i dont want anything, i dont need anything.  i feel awkard about the Christmas thing.  perhaps because i realize that it is more about Him, and less about what the world has created with red and green and the like.  Christmas to me is not really made up of money and material things...college has led me to appreciate it for what it is. A nice time to spend with my family, and i realize exactly how much i love them, because i have been away for them for much to long.  they know me, my quirks and my cynicism as well as the things that i truly feel and appreciate. i miss them. i really do. i miss being somewhat understood and i know that they care too much for me, and that is made obvious to me on numerous occasions.  I want to give them something in return, but what? what worldly object could possibly show them the amount of appreciation and love i have for all the love they have given, time they have spared and care that continually pours out from their hearts?  this answer i dont have. but i know that i will be able to give to them things i have created with all of my heart, and they will have meaning and it might not express alot but at least i cant give them back a little of what they have so graciously given to me. this i hope and pray. these are my thoughts on christmas.
