Hey family!
I AM SO HAPPY! A week from tomorrow I will be home with my family! I miss you guys so much! I can't wait to be able to spend some time with you guys and go shopping for your Christmas presents! I want to thank you guys so much for all the cards that you have sent me this semester they come at the perfect time when i need them the most! I wish so much that I could be somewhere close to home but i know that i would be miserable because this is where God has called me and I absolutely love it! I got to take pictures again for chapel I love that soooo much. Heather said that she talked to MR. Fox and told him that i was her "Right Hand Woman" I was like that is awesome. The more pictures I take and the better I get at it the more likely it will be that I will get to do them until I graduate. It will be really fun when i need to take Yearbook Production 1 and 2 for my English Major becuase i will already be partly involved. Anyways things are going really great I am in my last class of the semester before finals right now and it is such a relief. I am really excited about next semester, I talked to Mr. Fox to see if I could add a class and that since my GPA is above a 3.0 I will be able to take 20 credits next semester. I hope that it will all work out because if so I will be taking American Literature, English Composition, and World Literature. That would be awesome. I am finally getting into classes for my major. I am definately going to try to take interims during the summer so that i can get even more caught up from the transfer. That would be GREAT! I miss you guys so much and can't wait to see you all! I hope that you are all having a great day!   8 DAYS!!!!!!!! YIPEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I love you guys!!!!
