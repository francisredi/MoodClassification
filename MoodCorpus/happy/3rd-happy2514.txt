Stormy Day-- Big Fire
Happy Sunday Evening Everyone,
Well Nutty is still under the weather AND under the Christmas tree. She is really taking her sweet time getting better (Still not eatting anything) But I can tell she's a little better, but gawd she is so thin. The trick we have found is just to give her a TEANIE bit of syringed food every couple hours vs. alot in the morning and evening.I made a big fire today and its still going strong 8 hours later. It was a nasty rainy windy, thunder & lightning power outage day type day today.I tried to lure her onto a really soft blanket I bought on our trip to WA. It's SOOOOO soft...but she liked the warm lights on her belly more I guess.Kip and I went to our friends Christmas party last night...we had a great time. I will blab about it tomorrow because I want to show you this GREAT handmade Christmas gift list (booklet) my friend Anne made...she will be turning 16 in January and is a very clever creative chick-a-dee :)I finally finished printing out my Christmas cards today. Cutting it kinda short I know...

Well, I'll be at work for 4 more days then vacation until Jan 9th yeah! I plan on using some of that extra vacation week to start a new large watercolor. It's been a month of no painting and I am getting the itch to get a brush back into my sausage shaped fingers.

Night!
Lo**.
