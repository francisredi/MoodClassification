Game on!
A few of my friends have started getting into EVE, a space-based MMORPG, so I'm giving it a spin. The world is focused primarily on economy and politics rather than having the best items, which puts me in two minds about whether it'd be worth really getting into. As someone with a good head for numbers*, getting involved in a "corporation" which manages trade routes and retail stations provides some interesting opportunities for me to develop some planning skills, not to mention a chance to socialise with some serious gamer types**. We've started an in-game corporation, "Sanctus Society, Inc.", which I have high hopes for.

I ponder that it may not last for long... it never does. Within a month I'll have probably crossed the lines from distraction to escapism, and I'll back out faster than that guy who just clipped your wing mirror while he was parking. I tread a very fine line when delving into these universes, and am not very good with balance.

Considering the amount of stuff that's been happening, between Christmas, our Church Carols service, increased administrative involvement in the Church, a fairly large 3-month job that we just landed at work, training, and trying to keep fairly social, life is surprisingly peaceful.


(*) Probably inherited from my father, though he would cry if he saw my bank statements.

(**) I think that "good people" are even more recognisable and respected in a gaming universe where there is a lower standard of decency than the real world. There is little place for religion***, but I wonder if the need to have people out setting a good example in these virtual worlds is overlooked.

(***) Sanctus is translated into English as "holy", and the corporate logo is a fairly simple, bold crucifix. It was chosen because all good megacorporations in sci-fi universes need some religio-political subtexts, but I hope it also provides a good catalyst for people to talk about religion.
