Alls it takes is one smile to make me want you back.
Well this weekend went by pretty good. I got to spend some time with courtney and man I think we really needed it. We just sat around her house on Friday night and talked until she fell asleep and then I went home and we spent most of the day together on Saturday and all we did was hang out and talk about the past. Man what a goofy ass I have been over the past 3 years. Anyways after that we just watched tv and movies, it was really cool and I found out quite a bit about how court feels and what is going through her mind as she did with me and the AWSOME this is that we didnt argue once the whole weekend and let me tell you that is great. Today we went out to breakfest at Shaps. Court and I had french toast, which was good, Court also had a cheese pizza. Kinda of weird but that is why I love her. After we ate we went to Target and finished up our christmas shopping. She ended up buying about 5 things for herself though but that is cool because I think that she looked hot in all the things that she bought but that is a diffrent story. Then I took her home and then to work. Wow what a great weekend and I thought that the whole week was going to suck with the way it had started off. Me and Court have laid a lot of things to rest but we still have a long way to go to get back to the way we where with eachother. Also I can kinda of say that I am starting to feel like the old me and I really havent had a jelous thoughts in a while. But I guess I go to bed and get ready for the next week.
