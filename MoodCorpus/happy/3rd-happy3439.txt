What are you happy about right now?
John and I threw a party a few days ago. I'm proud to say that unlike every other party we've ever thrown, I enjoyed this one. I know that John was hoping to get out of all the work that went along with a holiday celebration this year, but I think it was good for us. We did something out of the ordinary that was still extremely familiar to us.

Of course, the usual crowd wasn't invited. That includes John's least favorite neighbors; the Colemans. I think its safe to say that they won't be speaking to us for a while because of this. They're just miserable enough to hold a grudge over something so small. Nevermind how--nevermind. They're not worth thinking of when I have something to be happy about. 

I think it would sound dramatic to say it, but this party felt like a new type of indepdence for the two of us as a couple. We're meeting new people and trying new things. And we're no longer doing any of it out of obligation. The party was the result of hours of planning and compromise on the part of myself and my husband, and it was a success. 

We may be one of the more unusual couples out there, but there's something to be said for an unusual couple who can throw a good party. 

I also thought the party was a good experience for us because it gave us a chance to see that we can be around other people, and slightly fabricate our identies without giving up who we really are. Without the burden of keeping up performances for each other, we manage to do a fine job of getting through them for other people. 

Now that its over, I realize the party was another test. I'm happy because we passed this one. Unlike several of the others.
