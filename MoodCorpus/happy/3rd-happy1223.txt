"Do what you will"
the word is that love is the highest love, love under will. Each of us are a divine being, every man and woman is a star in a divine orbit. We only encounter problems when our orbits intertwine. The deal with me is and always has been that at times, others enter my orbit, and leave. I certainly miss them, but i'm on my own path, too. 


I don't know what i'm doing with this large some of money that i'll have once this lease is up. Part of me wants to say that i'll go to whatcom until i finish my A.A., then try to transfer to western. My transfer GPA from WVC is like three seven, getting into whatcom wouldn't be difficult. Transfer to western for journalism, live in the doors and rack up an excellent amount of student loans...at least they wouldn't be fines from the man. 

Such a dream, such a dream. I Know i could be a successfull journalist, and i know i don't want to cook the rest of my life. And i know this is silly...me delaying something i know i could at least Try to succeed in...but. I'm the type to set up beautiful self sabotage. We'll see when i really have the money. I'm a blue collar boy, and i always have been. I don't have the tools to survive in the real world, and at this point i feel like college would really be a step backward. But maybe not.

Oh. and at the urging of my vanity, i may post some pictures soon. Including one of a really rad oil scar from work.
