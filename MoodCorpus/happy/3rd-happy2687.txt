last day of work till next year
what a great day i've had.first a patient;s family gave me a christmas card with a 10 dollar gift certificate for chapters,then another one gave me a lovely bunch of carnations,in a milk bottle style,vase,also same family is writing a comendation that will be in my permenent record of how great a nurse i am.also another patient gave me a christmas card with a box of belgium choc. my boss told me today about the written comendation.how great is that with a job i love.lol.i don't go back to work till jan.2 on a week of nights.i think sometimes i really rock hahahahaah.i think i kinda went crazy with christmas shopping for ottawa especially with gaby because i might have trouble packing everything up lol.i will still need to shop some more when i hit ottawa lol.i hope i have room for the stawberries.i'm going over to ralph's for dinner on thur.to give them their christmas gifts.i talked to ralph the other night and he told me his oma is moving in with him at the start of the new year.this will be good.i hope she can teach jade some german.i will help out as much as i can.i talked to kathi last night and had to bite my tung several times.i finally asked her if she thought jade might one day think of her,like she thought of her dad,but she said definately not because she wasn't deserting her but would be the fun one.i just gave up.she thinks of her self as the one that will be lots of fun and not the parent that says no.kathi is more like her dad then she thinks.i will take nan tomorow to pay her bills and maybe get my hair cut.
