Everything according to plan so far
The workload here tonight is completely manageable for once, so I should be able to leave as close to 7am as possible. I've got a nice bowl of soup and a cup of green tea in front of me now, and have coffee and oatmeal waiting for me around 6am before I leave, and in between releases I'm updating the music on my tiny flash-based MP3 player.

A good night so far, but all of this is more important to me right now because I have my snowboard and all my gear in my car down in the garage.  When I leave here at 7am, I'm heading directly up to Mountain High for my first rides of the season.  I figure I'll just get a 4-hour lift ticket today, get out of there in the early afternoon and on my way home before traffic turns from bad to worse, and will wait to see if anyone is still planning on heading up over the weekend.

The plan should also allow me to get a couple hours of napping in before getting up for Perversion.   is currently in town from Detroit on business, and is planning (last I checked) on coming out to the club with me).  He and I were never extremely close (we were part of the same larger karaoke bar crowd for a while), but he was always a good guy to hang with and I'm looking forward to seeing one of the old faces.

Then I'll have Friday to rest, and Saturday is Almost Acoustic X-Mas!

...good times. :-)
