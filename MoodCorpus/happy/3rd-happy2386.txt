ok here wats up so far in my life...
ok so i get out of skool counting thge secounds till i get to go home and sleep for a change, the nicole, shannon, johana, sara,and i get on the bus. the we get dropped off at the deltona library. sara gets picked up by here mom like always except for this one time this week wen she didnt come for a while but then she came and it was all good. but the point here is that we start walkin and o yea on the bus i was lookin at an old galexy year book from last year and i found out that one of my really good friend's younger brother went out with nicole. and like the whole time i was like omg and i was tellin every body every thing i know about him cuz that is wat i do wen i get excited and i dont get excited often but wen i do i really do so wat happends is that im all like omg and wat ever and we get this great idea of sneeking into galexy and seeing him becuz we are a bunch aof freshies with alot of time in our hands. so  we get there and nicole gets a lil scared so she calls her mom to tell her that we are picking up her sister dana. cawinsidently they go to the same skool so it all worked out.  but wat happends is that we get there and all the cars are lined up and we are just laughing and goofing off and the bell rings and the kids get out. i meen a jun=nk load of kids get out like an ocean of them out of one place. ok so wat happends is that we see nicole's sister and we are all like " HEY DANA!" and she looks at us as if we are freaks and then she is like "ugh" and walks right past us with out even a glare leaving us yerllin at her saying hi which was like the funniest thing! so wat happends is that nicoles chaces after her and gets her to wait for my really good friend's younger brother, cesar. So were there anbd we dont see him for a while but then some one sees him and once we are there of course no one wants to go and johana is like ill go if you guys s dont want to go. by the way johana's sister came and she looks almost exactly like her, but like i was saying we see hima nd no one wants to do it i dont want to look retated and we are like  really fustrated. so wat happends is that johana goes and i dont want to look like an idiot so i go too. and im like "hey cesar wats up" and hes all suprised and wat ever. then im like hey guess wat i have some one i want to show you she goes to skool with me and she said that she went out with you. we came all thins way to see you" and he smiled all big and said " came to see me?!" and im like "yea". so i give hima hug then nicole comes from behind me and they are like "hey and wat ever" do their greeting thing. then wen that was opver we are like ok lets leave before we get in trouble. we leave, we start walkin out of the skool just laughjing and every thing about wat we had just done. o yea before we left i wen up to him opne more time and i was like " hey cesar, sorry for imbarresssing you here. " and he was like "its ok you didnt imbarress me" i was like "aww your soo cute wen ur weet , no wonder the girls cant get thier hands off of you" i didnt tell him that i thought it but any way we left. we went to our parents classroom.            So then my mom is all ready but hse cant leave because these ppl keep comin up toi her to talk i really hate it wen then do that. but wat ever we finally leave and i was tellin my mom wat happend and she was like "im suprised  that cesar wasnt imbraeessed, because he usually imbrarressed about every thing" which that i took effensivly because i dont think so and that was avery broad comment. sp then wat happends is thatwe are getting home i forgot wart we were talkin about but it was as if i there was n o problems between each other and ther usually is, so it was ok for once buit that didnt last long like it usually doesnt. but hey im gonna stopp her alot happend but i dont feel like typing any more so ill gd o that later. l;ike in my nbnext journal. and ill write about the concert and wat ahappend sunday and how "some body " makes me want to thro up every time i see hima dn how he is growing chest hair which is funny! ok thats it for now. ttyl loves....
