happy hannumas
Happy Hannumas everyone!!!!  Hope everyone had a good christmas/hannukah!  I know I did!!  i am so psyched--i get to go to NYC to visit marni AND go see the musical that my cousin's husband produced (it's suppossed to be broadway-worthy!)...I am SO FREAKING excited!!!!  got lots of other great stuff too but that was the best thing (besides tickets to Wicked :-P ).  

Anyways i really hope everyone's holiday break is going well--relaxing and all.  

So get this--Phil sent me a gift and a letter the other day.  apparently he's super depressed or whatever and is now seeking help.  lets all hope i wasn't the cause of that...considering dating a guy a month 2 years ago is not as big of a deal as he is seemingly making it.  he poured his heart on onto a piece of paper for me basically almost as though i should call him up after all he's done and whatnot and forgive him.  sorry dude--you can give me all the words and gifts in the world--i am not getting back with you and i am not forgiving you for calling me a bitch.  but he did give me a snapple facts game which was pretty neat--looks fun.  i sware the kid is stuck in senior year...i never knew that he actually cared as much as he is now.  a little late bud--a little late.  i have moved on since two years ago--you should too.  he's starting to way creep me out.  he won't stop calling/texting/IMing and i have flat out told him to stop.  arg!

tomorrow i have to go back to work and then friday is my last day until the summer!  woot woot!!!!!!!  small doses at a time are all i can take of the little 3 and 4 year olds.  the 5+ group is my summer group and they are sooooo much easier to handle!!  :-P  

oh yeah--today's marni's birthday!!!!!!!!!!!  HAPPY 19th BIRTHDAY MARNALA!

anyways--yeah that's about it in my life.  gotta run--party tonight!  PAR-TAY!!!!  hahahahaha  adios
