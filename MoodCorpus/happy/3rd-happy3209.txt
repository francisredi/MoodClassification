I'm never buying popcorn ever again.
After seeing what that yellow grease really is . . . well, at least I know why my mom always prohibited me from ever putting butter on my popcorn. There were these people who would walk up to me and say, "I want butter on my popcorn", so I would put like . . . one squeeze of butter on it. "No, more." Put a little more. "No, more." Until I could see the popcorn swimming in butter. Yuck. I accidentally asked one man, after one squeeze, "Would you like some popcorn with that? I mean, butter?" Yeah, it was my first day. 

But I'm making friends quickly! Apparently, the woman who hired me, Alana, is always on pot. Nate always sings and almost all the girls who have worked with him hate it, but it just so happens that I'm used to singing people (and bad, at that) because of damn band. Today it was Come Sail Away by Styx. He even did the drumming. So yes, I am happy with my job and everyone's pretty leniant. None of them have read the employee's handbook. And my "boss" said I did an awesome job. 

We usually stay for three days at Grandma's during Christmas, but I have work on Monday at twelve, so we're going to have to cut one day out. Um . . . I need to make a Tom Jones CD, I need to finish M+I chapter one before the year ends, and . . .

Oh yeah, I got TOEJAM AND EARL on my computer and it's legal because I own the original copy! So I'm going to go laze about now.
