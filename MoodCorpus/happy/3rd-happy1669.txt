Wow, its EARLY for me!!
ok so i got up at 8 am just to watch Ebay items. 
and am currently winning the Crescent Wand. some jackass put the bid up to 91 dollars. damn them! but i made a higher max bid just to be safe. 
fuckers. 

and i buckled at the last minute and went for the desiguse pen. 
i really hope the user tatu_love_r1 isn't  or she'll be pissed. i did tell her about the pen, but i never got a response from her, so i suppose its all cool. and she doesn't strike me as a tatu fan. 

my mom thinks i'm crazy for getting up this early just for something stupid.
but i don't care, i see it as fate. 

i was supposed to work from 10 to 7 and i was given a schedule change to 4 to 10 tonight.

i see it as a sign of a higher power.
the shopping gods are giving me another chance to get the item i want!!!

i also decided i wanted the cosmic crescent jewel box too. 

i did get money from my relatives so i'm using that for this sailor moon stuff.

actually, its funny because i don't really mind whether the item is japanese or american, i like both and i noticed the american cresent wand i'm bidding for has a stupid ring you can 'wear' as the Imperium Crystal, however, i have a few crystals (mostly tree ornaments i've doctored) and made into Imperium Crystals myself. i can easily attach one onto my wand. IF i win it that its!!!!!
