No Jenn this morning! :(
Well for the 6th day there was no Jenn this morning. I am so sad cause I want to talk to her and tell her everything that has happened. Hopefully tomorrow she will call. That will be a week! It just is not right. Well today I did my normal stuff. Post office, bank, webwork, cleaning. Then tonight I went out with Chris and Michelle and this time I only had 1 drink! Chris made it a strong one, but it took me an hour and a half to drink it! They had like 12 in that time. I am slow with drinking. So I watched them play darts and it was fun. Mainly just to get out for awhile and I only spent $1 on a soda!!!!! 
The tonight Rhia and John came home and John bought a Game Cube!!!! LOL, Now for video games here we have.... 3@ PS2s, an XBox, a Game Cube, a Nintendo 64, a Nintendo, and a Sega Genesis!!!! 8 video game units here!!! LOL We are a bunch or Nerds!!!! That is ok, I was called a Tekie!!! LOL I know alot about computers but not that much! I like Tekie better than a geek like Jenn call me!!!! She wants me to work at Geek Squad cause I am a Geek to her!!! :P
Well I am tired and a busy day tomorrow. I am going with Rhia shopping all day. Well, she will I am just going for the fun of it. I have no money. And we are then getting groceries when we are done at the mall! I may do my hair b4 we go in the morning. Not sure yet or what color. We will see. Black is coming!!!
So off to bed and hopefully Jenn will wake me up from my dreams!!! I would love that!!!! :)
