Relaxing With The Dozen / 2-Year Anniversary
I am now so much more stress-free than I was earlier today. For some reason I was just irked and irate in the early-afternoon, around three o'clock. But then I ended up having a huge chat online with a great friend of mine, and we really put some things into perspective and my mood was uplifted. That really brightened my spirit, and cleansed my thoughts which were really cluttered.

Nearing eight o'clock, my mom wanted me to watch "Cheaper By The Dozen" [2003] since it's due tomorrow at noon. I had a bowl of "Special K" and sat down with it. I actually really enjoyed it, as time flew by and it was 9:45 PM before I knew it. The special features were pretty good too. Although it may seem like a flaw in the casting, almost all of the actors and actresses are hugely well-known [Martin, Kutcher, Duff...]. It was worthwhile.

Afterward, I talked on the phone a whole bunch, filled out my Quizno's application, and counted the coins in my little coin car (currently $19 in coin wraps). I have something else to exclaim in an entry tonight, but maybe it should wait... hmm, entries late at night never really get much appearence, but maybe I'll just tell you... it's my two-year anniversary with LJ!

Yes, that's right, I've had it for two whole years now! As of 12-21-2003, I created my account approximately two years and an hour ago, heh. I didn't have very many entries in the first six months of my journal's existence, but that changed a bit, obviously! However, this isn't the big exclaimation entry--since it's late at night and I don't see the significance in it anymore, but ah, what the heck. It's out there, it's the anniversary, and it's been two great years with LiveJournal! I look forward to the third. Thanks, y'all for bein' there for me, you alls my inspiration!
