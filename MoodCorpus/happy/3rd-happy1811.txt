Fear not! For, behold, I bring you tidings of great joy, which shall be to all my people.
I am back in suburbia once again!!!&nbsp; Yesss.&nbsp; (And my family is already driving me crazy. Gotta love em...oh warning: my mom bought "holiday charades" so anyone that comes over is probably going to get suckered into playing it.)
Yesterday I went downtown with DG and my parents (talk about the hottest double-date possible) to see Tower Brass at 4th Presbyterian, partly because my teacher Christine plays in it.&nbsp; We went to Johnny Rockets and then drove around.&nbsp; I really wanted to go window shopping but it was about 10 degrees so I opted to stay in the car.
My reflections on first semester: fun...painful...eye opening...it was a blast, but I really wouldn't do it over again.&nbsp; Definitely looking forward to next semester, now that I've got some stuff figured out and first semester under my belt.&nbsp; My jury went pretty well and that's all I care about.&nbsp; My classes next semester&nbsp;aren't changing much except that I'll be taking my gateway course: Pop Physiology.&nbsp; And next semester I'm going to rush for SAI!&nbsp; And February 26th IWU's horn ensemble is having a concert, so if any of you would like to come visit that weekend, I would love you forever!&nbsp; Not that I won't anyway.
Have any of you not seen Pride and Prejudice yet, or want to see it again?&nbsp; I still haven't seen it and I'm ansty to go.&nbsp; Plus I want to see Chronicles of Narnia, and The Producers too.
I'm off to carol with my church! :-)&nbsp; Hope to see you all SOON!!!
