My hearts beats again
HELLO! i am updating my blog in a foreign country. heh i am actually in malacca now will be catching a bus back later. at one i think. the internet here is one ringgit per hr. haha my parents are like eating cakes at the cafe next door. bought so many clothes and crap this trip. Had A&W cory hotdogs and vanilla root beer floats the first day. whatever happened to the branches in s'pore. eating there brought back so many childhood memories. i clearly remembering eating my first hotdog at the Mandai zoo when i was a kid. watched Perhaps Love at the movie theatre yest. Takeshi is cute! i always thought he wasn't. the show started off a bit weird but i still understood it in the end. i thought the dance choreography would be fantastic with Farah khan as the choreography but it turned out quite unimpressive. the script was quite well-written though. the tickets were like 24 ringgit for three people. btw, the malaysian newspaper splashed a picture of Shah rukh khan and Farah khan in one of its pages. Shopping is funky. Paul Frank tees are like 30 ringgit only. less than that actually. Plus, they're not imitation okay. i also got some emilythestrange junk. "Misery needs company." (So true on Those days.) i've actually been to malacca a lot of times and always check in at the same hotel. This time, the balcony view was awesome. There was a new lighthouse and also a SPIT!! i was damn thrilled la. it was like, out of textbook haha. i could actually see the zig-zag motion thing and saw the spit getting more hooked each time i wake up. i had Watermelon Sorbet last night and i kept the container. will upload pics once i get my hands on a camera.

I cannot wait to get back to work. was looking through my receipts the other day in s'pore and i realised i have sold over 700 bucks worth of Vitasence products. :)
