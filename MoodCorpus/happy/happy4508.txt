YES!!! FINALLY! I found it!! :D
For a LONG time I've been searching for a story series. A yiff story yeah, but this one was written so well it was more than that, it was a love story.

Love in the Electronic Age.

That series of 5 chapters covers the events of Kurt Kitsunari, a Fox-wolf, and Chris Pylot, a human when they meet in college and the even that takes them appart.

I have been looking for this story for years, ever since my old D: Drive comitted seppuku and I lost over 100 meg worth of stories I had collected over the years (not to mention the 2 gig of furry pics).

Well, after some aimless searching through some other furry sites, I check with a site that was dead for a long time, Furry Pleasures. I don't know when or where that site was rebuilt, but I remember getting my first furry yiff stories from there, including old Road Rover yiffy stories. Those sections are gone now (*cries*) but there's now straight, bi, gay and lesbian sections rather than the jumble it was long ago.

http://furdir.thumper.net/fp/Gay/index.html is the address for the gay story section, where LitEA is found, just scroll down a bit to find them.

I'm suprised that Furry Pleasures is still working, most of the older Furry story sites are 404, or are there but ALL their stories are 404. It seems that YiffStar is the "in" place for yiffy stories now, but they don't have the entire collection of SwampRat's stories like Aradd's site once had (now ONLY equine stories/pictures) or some of the other sites I used to visit regularly that I can't remember their names and lost the bookmarks shortly after the sites disappeared.

Anyway, I'm ecstatic that I found Love in the Electronic Age again, and you should read it too, it's a great story.
