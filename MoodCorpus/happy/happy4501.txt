The Place Next Door
 Strange how life has a way of turning things over eh? 

So, I was haning out on Lang's porch with the guy next door - a nice guy, the old kinda guy that would probably like to live out his retirement somewhere kinda warm and have diner at 3 PM each night, you know?- having morning coffee when lo and behold, he wanted to sell his place. It just wasn't something he wanted to do anymore.

It's a rennovated victorian, one story connected to a two story. The kinda place that is used to having two business' below and a family up top. Good stuff. The bottom is nice and sturdy; it will be easy to make into a garage. So, we set this all in motion and with selling my old place and the amount of money that we got from the old house's insurance, we're going to barely be able to afford this one. I'm going to have to work my ass to the bone, but it'll be worth it. I know it will be eventually. This neighboorhood is so much better that kids actually play outside. There's a nice porch and an old fence [that needs some severe TLC let me tell you WHAT!] and even an old swing in the yard. 

We're going to settle in nicely.

It's pretty exciting. I'll be insanely busy getting ~Dreams!~ and our new place in order. First slot of business is, of course, to let old man Calhoun move on out . We should have the new place By June -- at least he's going to let me start working on the bottom floor and the rennovations for the place until we can both get settled. 

That's it for now!
