i know all about it, you don't have to shout it
i feel kind of bad because i suspect that i may now like ricotta.  i haven't ever liked it in even the smallest portions but recently have been able to eat cheese raviolis.  most of these definitely have ricotta in them.  well tonight my sisters had a christmas party and made lasagna.  i came home from work and kinda bitched about how i didn't like ricotta and my mom thought i ate it now.  so i made myself regular spaghetti but i should have at least tried the ricotta filled lasagna.  i haven't tried it in a couple years and now if i end up liking it and made a big fuss about it that would be annoying.  it would make me annoying is what i meant.  i can't believe there is only a week til christmas.  mad craziness.  kinda dreading going upstairs 'cause the girls have a  bunch of their friends sleeping over and they can get quite noisy.  i don't know if i ever mentioned this but my sis's are a year apart so they share a lot of the same friends.  i was mad at my mom earlier in the afternoon because alicia was trying to help her get ready for the party and she kinda got super stressed and flipped out.  then i came down to vacuumm and she went all bitchy again.  i didn't end up vacuumming which of course was partially to annoy her but also 'cause i had to get ready for work.  i'm really quite mean sometimes and should work on not doing the annoy mom thing on purpose.  it's prolly not fair to her at all and most times when i look back i realize she didn't really deserve it.  i love gillian welch's voice.  i need to get some of her other cds besides soul journey.  it also looks like i need to work on my capitilization.  well, not really but i do tend to ignore the rules sometimes.  i have tomorrow off which is fun because i work almost every sunday.  i don't mind working them but it's nice to have one off sometimes.  also means i don't have to go to bed early.  super yeah! :)
