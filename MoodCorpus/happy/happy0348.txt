No Pac Man drugs are bad!
I have had 4 tests in the past week and I am so drained.
I had 2 lab retests today and I am am glad to say that I FUCKING PASSED BOTH!! 
after I got out of the testing room I was sure that I had failed one of them. In true Sarah fashion I had worried myself to death and convinced myself that I had missed so many. All I have left now is a final that is on Wed. so I have plenty of time to study and prepair for it! Thank you Jesus for taking a break on fucking with me!

After 3 1/2 months we got a letter from the courts today. It said that as of June 9, 2005(my 21st birthday) I am emancipated. It also said that my sperm donar has to pay 1/3 of my college up until June 9, 2006 (My 22nd birthday). Even though he doesn't have to pay child support on me anymore the judge raised the support! Which means that he is only paying for 3 kids now but it is more then it was with all 4 of us on it. I found that very humerous! This is also a very good thing because it means that I am officially done with him. I can wash my hands of him forever!

My friend abby has fallen in love with James Blunt's album ans has therefore gotten me into it! I love his song "You're Beautiful". They have been playing the video for that song everyday on MTV U at school as well. 

I have also found that Mr. John Mayer has a myspace account that he updates frequently. He recently added a new version, of one of my all time favorite Mayer songs EVER, St. Patricks Day. It is so amazing. His voice is better then I have ever heard it before. I downloaded it and have been playing the shit out of it. I am really looking foward to hearing what his new solo stuff is going to be. I am so in love with TRY! It is amazing. 

Fact Of The Day:  Steely Dan got their name from a sexual device depicted in the book 'The Naked Lunch'.
