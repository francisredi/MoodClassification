My cat Sterling, well, Kathy's really....
I have a wonferful Domestic American Shorthaired grey/black tabby that I took into my home over a year ago.

He began to frequent my yard the week after Tucker, my neighbor Domie's tuxedo cat (they called him Boots) was stricken and killed on the main road. After about a month of three of hime living around us and bonding with me. I was first to feed, pet, and pick him up, he even tried to follow me inside. Then, one night, I heard a cat fight, and a black cat ran off. Sterling came to me, then stood off, and acted very strangely.

I went in and talked to Kathy, my wife, and we went back out to check on him better. We found that his eye had been punctured and a little eye jelly had oozed out a little, and just buldged there. We freaked, and went to Pets Inc. They looked him over and helped out. We brought him home and brought him in, and he's been inside the bedroom ever since. (I have to keep him away from the other cats.)

Well, frequently, when I come inside, he is resting on the floor or the bed, and he will look up at me and let out small purling meow and a chin bob, as if to say "Sup?". Also, he has repeatedly tried to trip me, and also begs for an open window.

Lately, Sterling has been taking my chair. There's only one comp, and when Kathy's on I, sometimes I talk to her or otherwise participate. Well, I have a little old backless swivel-char, butreplaced it with an old blue office chair I salvaged from work (about to be discarded) and use the backless swivel to prop my legs up. Well, every time I get up to do something, he hops up and plops down.

Bastard. I hate him. I love him. He's horrible. He's cute. Damn cat.
