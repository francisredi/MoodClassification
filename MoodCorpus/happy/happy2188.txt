7 months is nothing compared to 9 years, right?
I had a lovely chat with my sweet Craig yesterday that lasted about 4 hours long. Weekends are a lot shorter when you spend 4 hours on a phone with someone, but seeing how this someone is very special, I'll deal with having a shortened weekend.

Actually I am really excited to find out how he and  got on today, as Craig led her around Aberdeen for a while. I know when I talked to him yesterday, he was thrilled to be meeting a friend of mine from the states. And to be truthful, Bonnie, I am sooooo envious that you've gotten to see him while I'm stuck here until next year. lol Oh well, as I told Craig, 7 months is nothing compared to the last 9 years. And really I am so glad that he got to meet you, as you're just one of the greatest people to get to know. 

Tomorrow I start my vacation from work. It'll be nice to have one week of no complaining clients or projects with deadlines that I must adhere to. Tomorrow I am taking of to go visit a friend in Waco. I am so looking forward to seeing my dear Alli-cat. She has a concert down there (she teaches choir at a local high school) and Tuesday is a concert, so I plan on going down to support that for her. There's nothing like taking time out with a wonderful friend and just enjoying life. 

Life is going great right now. I am happy, healthy and couldn't ask for better people in my life than the ones that are!

Hope everyone out there is as happy as I am right now. :)
