The day after
Here's hoping you all had a Merry Christmas. I know  and I did. It was a little different from years past for us because we couldn't go home, but it was nice to spend the holiday just the two of us. Also, there was no snow to drive in. I love to look at snow, but somehow I don't think our little Neon would do terribly well in it.

And since  started it, here's what I got this year:
From Jenny:
Prince of Persia: Warrior Within (XBOX)
Eragon and Eldest (books)
Star Trek: Tales of the Dominion War (book)
Hook (DVD)
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (DVD)
A big HDD for the computer we're going to build soon

From my brother:
A henley sweatshirt
Gandalf Hallmark ornament

From my parents:
down comforter and duvet (the comforter is going back because we've already got one)
sheets set
snowmen ornaments (the kitties like to play with them and they look nice)

From me:
 and I found a sweet deal at Circuit City, so we upgraded our television set as a gift to one another. We found a 51 inch HDTV for about $400 off the retail price. Mario Karts have never looked so big! ^_^

The only thing on my list right now is a wi-fi dongle so that  and I can play Mario Kart DS online. There are plenty of hot spots in our complex, but everybody here is smart and protects their network with a WEP key. Come on guys, I just want to race! Oh well, maybe Fry's has them on sale. We have to go there today anyways.
