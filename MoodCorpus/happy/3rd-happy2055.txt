Relieve my boredom!
Okay, ATTENTION everyone: If I don't see you during break, I will die of sheer boredom, lol. I've missed everybody and I'm looking forward to hanging out with you guys. And Laura, I swear, if I don't see you by New Year's, I'm gonna come stalk you down and kidnap you just so we can go hang out, lmao. But don't worry, there won't be any Italians of the theatre persuasion around. Yes, to all my friends at Oakland, I am all up for going to Canada. If you want me along, just let me know when. Or Rick and Laura, if you can get Kandace to get Justin out of the house for the night...we won't have to leave the country lol. 

Man, yesterday was so much fun. The family Christmas parties are always great. I have the cutest little cousins, haha. I will have pictures up hopefully in the next few days on facebook. Feel free to check them out anytime. Scott and Vito will at least know who the vast majority of those people are, haha. 

I was really hoping to have a Christmas party this year. I don't know if that's going to happen though. I may have to wait till our next break. Then it really wouldn't be a Christmas party. This next semester is going to be crazy, though. I'll be teaching kids in inner-city Pontiac who only speak spanish how to speak english while helping them with their homework. It'll be difficult but I also think it's gonna be an amazing experience. I'm also probably going to be tutoring some more at St. Joe's for my teaching hours. Still gotta get about 35 more in by this time next year. Plus going to two different schools and working...that'll be fun lol. Oh well, at least I got my friends around to keep me sane. You guys are awesome. If I don't see you before Christmas, I hope you have a very merry and blessed one. I love you all =D
