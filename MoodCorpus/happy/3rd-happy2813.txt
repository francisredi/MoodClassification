A great day
I love it when my HS friends are home - if only they were around all the time and I didnt have to cram seeing everyone into just a couple weeks! Last night I went out to dinner with Stacey after going to the eye doctor and having him tell me I cant wear my contacts for at least a week - good times huh? I also got this whole list of stuff I'm supposed to do... hopefully it'll get better and I wont ever have to deal with it again! I'm so tired of having eye problems!

Anyways, went out to dinner and then Nick came over and he and Stacey and I played Anagram - fun game. It was great to see them again and was nice to know that I didnt have to get up for work this morning : - )

Today was great too. Tatsu came and picked me up - its still weird to me that he drives - and we went shopping ALL afternoon. He was getting Christmas presents for his family and his girlfriend. Anyways we went to Northgate, grabbed lunch and then spent the afternoon shopping. I love hanging out with friends I havent seen in a while and having it be just the same as it used to be. He and I have an odd relationship that never changes which I love and hope that it will always be that way. I hope that he will continue this coming home at Christmastime thing, it would be nice to get to see him at least once a year. I told him I'd love to come visit if I ever have money, since hes not living with Mike anymore but hes worried that his gf wouldn't like that too much... yeah she still seems kind of odd to me but anyways... it was a great day! Tonight I'm seeing friends again and then tomorrow back to work... 4 days of work and then Christmas!
