As Sarah Would Say...SNAPS!
We took Lydia to my dads at 2, she was being clingy with Jeff and I was worried about how she was going to act. I took her back to Sarah's room and fed her and Sarah came back with us and I left her back there and went and got Jeff and we left. I didnt give him a chance to say goodbye cause I didnt want her to see him and flip again. 

When we got to the theater I went to unlock the backdoors to get her out lol. The whole movie I kept waiting for the phone to vibrate but of course it never did. (The movie was great btw, I cried, of course.)As soon as we got out I called my dad to see how she was and he said she was tired and a bit hungry but she had been really good. WOW. I was really surprised. She didnt cry at all till right till the end and that was just out of being hungry and tired. I rushed back to their house, I admit it, I missed her fierce lol. When we got there she was sleeping on Sarahs lap, she had passed out in front of a baby E lol. I woke her up and fed her and Jeff took Sarah to get a prepaid minutes card for her cell as baby sitting payment. My dad raved about how good she was, said Sarah DID do the babysitting, and said everything was fine! 

I am so happy about this! This means that there IS a possibility of freedom ahead! Sarah is going to be spending a good amount of time with us next week during winter break so I think I am going to have her babysit one night and Jeff and I go out for dinner or something. We could wait till Lydders goes to bed since she usually sleeps 3-4 hours the first stretch. This is great! This is AWESOME!!! I am so proud of my baby girl! And I am so proud of me for not backing out of it. ;)

The only pooh thing was she slept on the way home-no help for that-so she just now went to sleep at 9.
