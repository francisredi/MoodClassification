Random Song Lyrics.
Close my eyesLet the whole thing pass me byThere is no timeTo waste asking whyI'll run away with you........ by my sideI'll run away with you........ by my sideI need to let go, let go, let go, let go, of this pride
yeah	I think about your faceAnd how I fall into your eyesThe outline that I traceAround the one that I call mineTime that called for spaceUnclear where you drew the lineI don't need to solve this caseAnd I don't need to look behindClose my eyesLet the whole thing pass me byThere is no timeTo waste asking whyI'll run away with you by my sideI'll run away with you by my sideI need to let go, let go, let go, let go, of this pride 
yeahDo I expect to changeThe past I hold insideWith all the words I sayRepeating over in my mindSome things you can't eraseNo matter how hard you tryAn exit to escapeIs all there is left to find	
Close my eyesLet the whole thing pass me byThere is no timeTo waste asking whyI'll run away with you by my sideI'll run away with you by my sideI need to let go, let go, let go, let go, of this prideUntil this echo, echo, echo, echo, in my mindUntil this echo, echo, echo, echo, can subside
So IClose my eyesLet the whole thing pass me byThere is no timeTo waste asking why	I'll run away with you by my sideI'll run away with you by my sideI need to let go, let go, let go, let go, of this prideUntil this echo, echo, echo, echo, in my mindUntil this echo, echo, echo, echo, can subside
