I'M ALIVE!!!  AAAALLIIIIIIIIIIIVEEEEE!
hi everybody!  christmas break wooo wooo!  some of you know this, but OHMYGOD i needed this break.  I needed to just do nothing for a good 2 weeks.  and that's pretty much the extent of my life at home.  here are some highlights:

~I will be 20 pounds lighter when i come back from break.  My mother has officially stopped cooking.
~I bought this really pretty bra even though the woman selling it to me said it was ugly (not a great selling point lady).  unfortunatly the ink tag is still on, making said bra unwearable.
~I have actually gone christmas shopping.  for people other than myself!  It's kind of amazing, because i haven't bought presents for my family in about 2 years (long lame story).
~I am knitting a scarf.
~Edward Albee is a strange man.
~1/2 way through one of 2 resumes i have to write this break
~I've just been going through my game collection, finishing up all my old games.  KOTOR2 and FFVII down, Tomb Raider and Vice City left to go.  FFX, X2, and San Andreas for winter study.
~My father's store is all over the news tonight because some crazy man was wandering around the parking lot, trying to steal children.  Really freakin scary.  Imagine you're putting groceries into your car with the baby in the front basket, and a man you don't know comes up and tries to take your child out of the basket.  YEA.  after he got caught and was in custody in the store, one of the mothers came back with a crowbar about ready to bash his head in.  i do not blame her in the least.
~I miss being able to get around without parental help.
