Saturday
What a simple subject huh?

last night went to dinner to celebrate Sean's bday.  we went to one of our favorite spots in town Casa Maria's.  it was a nice night of good company and great food.  always one of the most fun things for me to do, is quality time with good friends.  conversation was light and jovial.  

today has been a fairly quiet day.  my roommate has been in LA all weekend.  he went up to DisneyLand and WeHo.  i've been enjoying the peace here.  most of the time it's me who isn't here over the weekend.  this morning i went to Starbucks with Sean and Kai.  we hung out for about an hour or so and than dropped some stuff off at the UPS Store.  we are a wild and crazy bunch.  than i felt tired and wanted to go home because i haven't been sleeping well.  i was hoping to see Memoirs of a Geshia but that will be for another day i guess.  i've all ready seen two movies this week, i probably should save some for later.  my next two i need to see are Geshia and Rent.  i came home to take a nap which lasted all of 20mins and than i just spent the rest of the day watching MTV Real Life Prensents.  i'm chalking it up to being my last weekend at home i guess for the next 2 to 3 months.  

i might go out to Rich's later tonite for LL Bear, which is Leather Levi and Bear night.  it should be if Jay calls back and says he feels up to going.  i need to run to MacLeo this week and pick up the patches Sean ordered for the club while he is out of town.  i also need to get a new vest while i'm there too.  i know i should by a Leather jacket for MAL cause i'm going to freeze, oh the choices to make.  i need a Daddy to go with me to keep me warm LOL.  one of the disadvantages of being thin is no insulation.  

just because i'm feeling horny i'm going to post a picture of my ass.  maybe that will get me some action LOL.
