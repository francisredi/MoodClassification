So, yeah. I resent that Severus Snape thing, especially since he's a no good evil villan. Fortunately, I scored Voldemort last, though what's the difference between Voldemort's and Snape's ulterior motives? These people must be for the whole "Snape is misunderstood, not evil" thing. And Ron in second place? Ha! I never would have guessed, but excellent :). 

We (Grandma, Aunt Mary Jo, Uncle Doug and I) went to the holidazzle parade. Go Metrotransit! They had a bus that was  coated with Christmas lights. I love them. 
It was cool, though I still vote for the Marshall Field's display. It hit the nail on the head of quality and children's entertainment. I also did a little Christmas shopping at Borders (LOVE that store. It's jam packed with wonderfulness), and explored downtown St. Paul, which is a crazy mess but wonderful all the same. Went in the IBS building (in Minneapolis) before the parade, and it's got a great honking waterfountain spraying out of the ceiling four stories up to a pool below. We checked out a few departments, and I finally got to smell that "Angel" perfume with the gorgeous bottle and it stinks. Ugh. Way way way too strong. And also, I got to smell the Artemis cologne and I sprayed it onto a labeled tester strip and I...don't know what I'm going to do with it. Maybe stick it in The Eternity Code XD.
