A Great Weekend
Well, like the title says, it was a great weekend.

Saturday I spent most of the day getting ready for my party. Then everybody came over and we hung around, played some games (I thought doctor was annoying too!!), played with knives (can you guess who that was), went sledding, rode around my neighborhood in Bill's "massage" car, and then hung around some more. When everyone left I was so wound up I couldn't sleep for like an hour. I had a great time and I hope everyone else did!

Sunday, was just as fun. Went to church for first, served at second and then came the fun. After arguing with Bill about riding in cars alone with guys I ended up going with him, John and Steve S to the diner (but still not alone). We had food, duh. And then drove around in the "massage" car some more and threw CDs out the window. Amazingly we fit 8 people in his car later on. Bill had it nice and roomy in the drivers seat, John and Jared shared the front, and Steve, myself, Chantal, Chris and Matt were all in the back. Thankfully the ride didn't last long. Then we parked after like a half hour of driving around every one of the churches aditional parking lots. And we got a ride to the door from Amber. Again, pilling into Amber's two person jeep with the guys in the trunk. 

Then after that we hung around till everyone left after third. We finally started the play practice which went pretty well. 
And now I just had dinner and I'm really tired and I'm about to watch Braveheart (edited)(I don't watch R rated movies)(Well that's not true I have watched a couple unedited).
Anyway, I'm going away now. I'll post the pictures from my party later.
