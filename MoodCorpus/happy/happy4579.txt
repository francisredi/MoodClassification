AWESOME DAY
So I did my first case at Children's hospital today... first all by myself pump setup and going on bypass, coming off... it was great. So it was an 18 year old kid, but whatever, it was still doing real perfusion FINALLY!!! So YAY for good case!!!

Was leaving the hospital and saw all these people milling around the lobby (weird!) and looking out toward the entrance, but not too close (weirder). Then I discover why... i got caught in a stampede of Colorado Avalanche hockey players each with a HUGE delivery of Avalanche toys (hockey bears mostly). In the middle of the mass of men, I talked to a few of them, they were really nice. 

Get home and checked my email since I hadn't had a chance all day and find one from my preceptor in Indiana offering me a job!!!! Yes, a real staff perfusionist job 6 months before I even graduate!!! I'm so excited, I can't stop smiling. Everyone vies for staff jobs, and you're lucky if you can find one nowadays. And the trippy thing is I was talking to one of my preceptors now about applying for jobs, and I told him I'd start in January after i had time to buff up my resume and CV and all. And then last night I had a dream that I was in Indy working there and had gotten Patrick (the guy who actually leaving, and they want me to replace) a laser pointer--huge perfusion inside joke there... but I never thought that would actually mean that I'd get an offer! 

Chris is so happy, that means he doesn't have to move, I can just move in with him, saves us a LOT of money having to find a new place, and both of us moving and all. 

YAY--SUCH A GOOD DAY!!!! And I go home tomorrow... what could be better?!
