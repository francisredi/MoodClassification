productive?
Was today productive at all?  I'm not sure.  I got up about noon, bummed around, talked to my mom, etc.  I called Miami Beach PD to see if I got a parking ticket but they're not sure yet, so I'm going to call back tomorrow.  I went to the Boca Town Center to attempt some Christmas shopping but I only stayed 30 minutes.  I had no idea what I was looking for so it seemed pretty pointless to deal with the crowds.  I went to Publix on my way home for stuff for dinner tonight.  I made a beef casserole I really like.

I cracked out on WoW for a while tonight and even leveled.  :-D  I did it all by myself, too.  I had these quests that were taking FOREVER to finish but I finished all three of them tonight.

After WoWing I caught a wild hair for some reason and decided to pull out some Christmas stuff.  I took out my Christmas afghan, stuffed Santa, dish towels, pot holders, and some placemats and napkins.  Tomorrow I'll set up my nativity scene.  I also need to straighten up my apartment tomorrow... it's gotten very out of whack since I've been traveling so much.  At least I have leftovers so I don't have to worry about dinner tomorrow night!

Criminal Intent is on Bravo.  :-D  I was watching Cheers on TV Land but... Law & Order is very relaxing to me.  Except for SVU.  That can be a little stressful when it's about a rapist.

Ok, going to do a little Christmas shopping online, then get some rest for work tomorrow.
