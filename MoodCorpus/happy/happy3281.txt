THE TRUE MEANING OF CHRISTMAS
Sometimes I have a great feeling that I am not loved, or no one in the world cares enough to know if I disappeared forever........Today I felt the exact opposite, for my daughter has already given me one of the greatest gifts a mother could receive.&nbsp; 
Dakota left for school this morning.&nbsp; This afternoon when I picked her up she came up to the truck and told me to close my eyes.&nbsp; She was carrying a large bag (with help from a teacher), and in general, just a whole bunch of stuff.&nbsp; I was like "what in the world".&nbsp; Then when I saw the herd coming out, all of them were carrying more or less the same thing.&nbsp; 
SO I finally get an explanation. It seems the Mission of Hope from Knoxville dedicated themselves to my daughters school this holiday season (which is a real blessing for most of them, it's the poorest and smallest in TN).&nbsp; I was really grateful that someone finally helped out the people around here during the holidays.&nbsp; They had brought this tractor-trailer filled with toys and all sorts of goodies for the kids.&nbsp; My daughter said they got to just go in and get what they wanted.&nbsp; Because they only have a little over one hundred students, they got to go in twice.&nbsp; 
My daughter picks out a pair of new roller blades for herself, and a bunch of smaller things (along with ANOTHER Spongebob pillow).&nbsp; What did she do with her second trip in????&nbsp; SHE picks out things for her mother.&nbsp; Yes, she had a bag of stuff which she proudly claims as her gifts to me.&nbsp; So, I cried.
Tonight she spent over half an hour in her room wrapping them.&nbsp; They are now under our tree.&nbsp; Little does she know, or can I even begin to explain to her that she already gave me something that cannot be measured or outdone.
