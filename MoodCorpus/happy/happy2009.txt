I'm Getting Married!
Joe and I are getting married!! Here is the story and the pictures.

Yesterday, I worked the UWC Toys For Tots Show. I was booked in a Triple Threat Match against Cindy Rogers and Allison Danger. We had a GREAT match!! Me, being the heel with Cindy, ended up cheating and taking the win. I hit Allison in the head with the United States Championship belt (which Joe awarded to himself!) and tossed Cindy from the ring, pinned Allison, and enjoyed the feeling of winning my first match! Go figure that out, I just now won my first match, but I'm the women's champion for SAW. Haha! Well, anyway, I headed to the locker room, but Liz Savage (Beth) reminded me that Joe was going to cut a promo. So I got back into the ring, celebrated with Liz Savage and Joe, it happened. Joe proclaimed his dislike for the crowd, turned to me and congratulated me on winning. Then he said "and one more thing! Taylor Nicole, will you marry me?!" He was down on one knee, looking up at me, with those beautiful brown eyes of his. I covered my face, started crying, and nodded my head. Then said "Yes, I will". Meanwhile, in the background, the crowd, who didn't know the whole thing was real, boo-ed and yelled "SAY NO!"

And that is how it happened! I'm going to be the future 'Mrs. Joe Rules' and nothing in the world could make me happier! I'll keep you all updated on details.

Here are the pics for you all to see:
