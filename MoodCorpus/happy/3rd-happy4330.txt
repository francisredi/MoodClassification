During a really fierce thunderstorm yesterday, lightning hit nearby our house.  I was on the interweb and my DSL connection went out.  After fighting with the modem thingy for an hour with Brandon on the phone, I dialed the Bellsouth number.  Come to find out that the lightning hit some wires and fried my prescious connection. (Cue Darth Vader "NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!) Now we're (I'm) strugging on stupid 56k (more like 56gay, amirite?)
