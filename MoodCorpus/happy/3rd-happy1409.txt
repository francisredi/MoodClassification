"Dad, did you get me a turtle...?"
Well wow, I have not updated in quite a long time! 
A lot happened since my birthday I believe. Hmm but you guys already know that so theres really no point in talking about it to a computer. But I've realised that I sort of forget myself sometimes. Because I think I'm thinking about myself, but really Im like taking on what other people are feeling and trying to deal with it all and stuff... so then another part of me goes, "What about me?!!!" And so it gets my attention in other less productive ways! 
So I need to set boundaries, which was told to me by an armadillo medicine card. I recently really like things like that, and although I suppose I've always sort of believed in that kind of stuff it lately really interests me. Not religion, but faith in life and fate works for me. No strings, wars, or sins attached, just life and happiness and the faith and trust that things will work out, even if my superlogical side will dispute that... It makes for interesting internal dialogue. 
I played monopoly twice yesterday and I won BOTH TIMES! Yeah, I definitely got really excited by that... lolll. But I really want to play it with my dad, except he barely ever likes to play games. Actually my whole family doesnt like to play games, except my mom who likes to play Scrabble and my brother who likes to play Mystery Detective!!
Today i went shopping at 4th street, it was so much fun!! I love that place sooo much!!! And I really wanted to go to the vivarium, but I didnt. But yeap.
Tomorrow I get to make christmas cards and bake and decorate!! I love christmas so much. it's really interesting how I take a lot after my aunt I think. Hmmmm. 
It's WINTER BREAK!!!!! I hope I get some action.
