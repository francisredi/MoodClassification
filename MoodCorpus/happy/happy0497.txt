*laughs* Ah december in russia!
Right now, outside it's about -6 C AND it's supposed to snow basicly for the next weeks, it's crazy! This morning, Raoul and I made a run to the theater to check on everything, which of course meant we brought Ilya with us. Of course we drug Alexei and Nikki with us. *laughs* We're terrible friends! Anyway when we got to the theater chris's boys were in the middle of a HUGE showball fight. And of course Alexei and Raoul scampered off quickly to hit eachother with snowballs. *laughs* Anton and tristan and some of the other men were inside playing pool and drinking hot chocolate (SMART BOYS!) It was so cute, Ilya was all dressed up in his snow suit like a little marshmallow, he was adorable. He saw Anton and started pointing and laughing and getting all excited. *laughs* He's so precious! He ended up spending a better part of the morning playing with Anton. I think they both liked it *laughs* I can't even begin to tell you what an amzing litte guy Ilya is! I love him so much. He's going to be so excited on christmas! *laughs* You guys should see all the stuff Raoul and I have bought him already. Lol he's going to be so spoilt it's not even going to be funny. *laughs* I adore him though, he's such a sweetheart. Speaking of him, he's getting into trouble *laughs* He's messing with the christmas lights running along the floor of the entertainment room. Hm. I think he and I are going to go look for Raoul.
