Twas an awesome Holiday
I love the Holidays, especially when I get what I want. I asked for Gift card and for the second year in a row I was not disappointed. Last year's total of Gift cards was 350. This years grand total? 500+

What did I get with all those gift cards? Well now I have become a whore of the Apple iPod revolution. I got me a 30GB iPod Video and that thing was sweet. I did want a 60GB but none of the Best Buys in my area had any so I was like "Eh whatever I probably will never run out of space" besides I could always sell Cristi my 30GB and buy a 60GB at some point but that probably won't happen for a long while. 

Obviously I'm going to use it for my music but its also handy for the fact I can watch stuff during work. I did just put the first 7 episodes of Bleach on it. I could probably put other things and I can easily remove them.

At some point I'm going to have go through my computer and archive all mine and Cristi's music, and video files onto CDs so I won't run out of room.

Anyways yeah I had a pretty good weekend saw both sides of the family as well as hanging out with Louis yesterday and watched Raw. Louis hooked me up with some awesome programs plus we just chilled. With his iPod and mine as well as my XM our road trip for New Years is going to rock!!

The rest of my gift cards were used to get iPod accessories as well as get some things for Cristi.

My Christmas is still not over yet cause I will be getting my Belt next week XD

I hope everyone had a good holidays. See ya!!!!
