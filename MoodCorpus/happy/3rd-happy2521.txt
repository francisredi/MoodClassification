My hair smells like oranges =-O
Hmm so the rest of last week I pretty much finished up the rest of the semester, I have one more final to go on Tuesday at 12:30, and that would be math.  Awesome.  It won't be hard, plus I get to sleep in...kinda.  Thursday I had my English final in class, then Friday I had my Reading final in class...both were fairly easy.  Friday night I hung out with Scott (it was a darn good thing cause I missed him!) and we played some games w/ the fam.  Good times...even though he wins every single game that we play!! What can I say? My boyfriend's a winner ;D  Overall, it was a really great night.  Then last night me and Scott watched Chelshead...my parents went to a Christmas party at seven and didn't end up getting home til 5 in the morning.  I was sleeping and all of the sudden I hear this tapping on my window, then someone was knocking really hard on the side door.  I laid there for a second, kinda scared, checked my cell phone to see what time it was, then figured it was probably my parents.  So I walked over and unlocked the door for them and my dad started yelling at me for locking the door.  I was half asleep so I was like, umm yeah dad, I was home alone, what do you want for me? And got back into my bed.  Haha it was kinda funny.  Then I ended up waking up at 12ish...just kinda lounged around all day.  Then I was talking to Suzanne and she wanted to do something so she came over at around 7:30, we ordered a pizza from Papa Johns, and since they don't deliver in our area we went and picked it up on Maiden Lane, haha.  Then we were trying to figure out where we could eat it, and decided to go to my grandma's since it was the closest.  After we just kinda drove around, ended up downtown, haha.  We always have adventures when we're together :)
Wellp, that's all, I'm tired!
