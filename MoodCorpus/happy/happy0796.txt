Kibby Concer!!!!!
Oh, oh, oh, I forgot to mention what an amazing concert that Dan B. fellow produces.  



It's not really a dome, more of a Quonset. 

D and I sat on the hard stadium bleachers and I read the program, showing 20-some different groups performing from such wildly flung places as Deary and Potlatch, bemoaning that the daughter's group was dead last so I couldn't even sneak out.

Then it started.  Lights, camera, action.  I felt like I was watching PBS. It was musically seamless with the strings offering up little segues between the groups, program was varied, some magnificent -- CHS, both choirs really kicked ass.  I had no idea how much better Clarkston was than everyone else, including at least one of the UofI groups.  I really liked the tenor's Sugar Plum "deedle-deedle dee's".  Well executed!

K's group, Jazz Choir-I was oceanic.  It's big, it's bold and beautiful, it's mighty, it's fabulous.  "Eternal Father" is the song they buried people at sea with, as Anabelle used to tell me.

The final number included absolutely everyone, from Tommy's Tinklers (bell choir) to the two children's choirs.  It was a massively arranged conglomeration of less heard holiday greeting songs twined together and ending in a way that made me feel like they were shooting off all the fireworks.

Spectacular.  Over two hours long and had my attention the entire time.
