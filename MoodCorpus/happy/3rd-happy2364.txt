woo hoo
There's nothing much to say except Suzanna got out of the hospital yesterday. Her platelet count was 1 on Wednesday and it's suppose to bed 150-450. It's still not up, it's only like 35 now. Other than that she's doing pretty good.

My date went awesome last night. He's the sweetest guy ever and I didn't realize how much we have in common. Plus he never made a move, mostly eye contact though. He didn't kiss me, hold my hand, or put his arm around me. But I'm glad he didn't because it was the first date and we need to take it slow. He did open my door for me and stuff. We ate at Guthrie's and went to see Yours, Mine, and Ours. That was a whole lot better than Cheaper by the Dozen. The movie got over at 9 and we rode around Haleyville until about 10:30 I guess and went to Natural Bridge Restaurant to play pool. I had to teach him how to play. On the way there we almost hit a deer, it was sooo close. It scared the crap out of us. We also drove around looking at Christmas lights and also went down to the ones at city lake. I had such a great time, best date ever. He's suppose to call me back sometime to set up another date. Another good thing is mom likes him, yay. What's funny is that he's pretty much like me and if you saw us together you'd think we were a cute couple, lol. Enough about my date, I'm sure you don't want to hear about it.

Well, I think I may watch a movie or something. Goodnight! Love you all! Kisses and hugs
