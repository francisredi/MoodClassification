I'm excited!
I just placed my order!&nbsp; This year, the bonus program at work was great!&nbsp; If I hit certain targets, I got points to spend on this rewards website, and I just redeemed them for a new Palm Zire 72, a poker table for M, an awesome knife set, and more gift certificates for The Keg, Alice Fazooli's, Jack Astor's, Red Lobster, Cineplex, Blacks and Winners than I can shake a stick at!&nbsp; All for doing nothing more that my job that I would be doing anyway.&nbsp; Good deal!&nbsp; I'm especially excited about the new Palm, because I recently lost my old one, and that thing is my electronic bible!&nbsp; I'm pretty excited to have gift certificates to give to my family at Christmas too!&nbsp; I am just like Jolly Old St. Nick himself!
Today was M's work children's Christmas party.&nbsp; It was at the Mississauga convention centre, and I thought it would be awful, but it was GREAT!!&nbsp; They had this huge banquet hall rented, and it had a bunch of bouncy castles and games and electric cars and stuff.&nbsp; There was a really kid friendly lunch (macaroni and cheese, chicken fingers and fries, etc) and a great Santa.&nbsp; Although the place was packed with over 800 kids and their parents, it didn't seem that chaotic or crowded, and generally, I didn't hate it like I usually do when I'm forced to spend time with other people's children!&nbsp; Brian loved it, and that's what counts.&nbsp; He even got his face painted like Spider Man.&nbsp; Of course, I wish that I'd known that Santa was there for pictures before we did the face painting, but hey, there are worse things than a picture of Santa with Spider Man in his lap, right (that sounds kinda dirty...hee hee).
I'm tired, and I have heartburn.&nbsp; I think I'll go to bed...
