When Everything Feels Like the Movies...
Friday, please come.
Everyone is just so stressed, and it's stressing me out, man. :-)
Today was okay. I can handle whatever grade I got on my biology exam because biology was so much dang fun. Janelle + me + Prof. Platt? It's all about the journey, kids.
Went to Steak N' Shake. So many good memories. It's comforting to know that it doesn't matter if I'm in South Bend, IN or Schaumburg, IL--there's always an S N' S nearby, and I am instantly transported to Keeley and post pep-band functions and HOME.
I miss my friends so much. And my Jonny. It's really pathetic, but I can't let people I care about go. Especially ones who have given me so much.
If I had all the money in the world, I would buy a perfect little town. It'd have great schools, a mall, a forest preserve, an ocean, a playground, and every house would have a front porch. I'd send out invitations to all of my favorite people to come live with me. Could you imagine the barbeques, the birthday parties, the births? We could all walk in one another's back doors. "Uncle Putti!" That's what they'd call you. "Mom, can I go over to Auntie Susan's house?" "Aunt Lindsay says she wants to take me to get a manicure, k?" "Uncle Tony is going to pick me up to go to the zoo." "I've just gotta run over to Aunt Keeley's to wake her up. We're watching TV together!" That's what I'd do.
I know this day, this week, this life is hard. But you just gotta get through it...for doors and sardines, if nothing else.
