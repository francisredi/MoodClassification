Wedding Pics
I don't feel sick for the most part at the moment, just a bit uncomfy in my stomach.  I felt like I would this morning, but I actually haven't gotten sick today.  Blah.  I should stay away from the chocolate from Reynolds, because I want too much chocolate and then i don't feel too great.  They're sitting next to me in their big box, truffles and peach cream and cocnut.  Mmm.  I have no willpower, but I know what's god for me.  Then again, I did pour barbeque sauce on my spaghetti tonight.  I'm so not hungry right now, yet I think of food.  Silly girl, I am.  At least I'm content for the moment, not full of meaningless turmoil.

We tried to get my name changed today--at least on my license--but i had no important mail in my name at this address, so I have to wait.  Finally did the chaneg of address form at the post office.  That was new and different.  Now I'm looking through all of our wedding pictures to see which ones I like the best and just to see them all.  There's tons and tons of them, so it's a little tedious to see the same shot ten times with only slight differences after awhile.  It put Autumn out for the night up in the bed.  She's still adjusting, and will for a long time probably, but at least she gets a chance to see my parents and Jenny and all of that, so it's not utter submersion.  I'm a lot more comfortable with everything.  I suppose I believe more because everyone tells me so.  It's nice looking at these pictures without her needing explanations about every little thing and telling me to go back to some random spot she forgets. :)  Sweet girl.  Sweet dreams. *~~
