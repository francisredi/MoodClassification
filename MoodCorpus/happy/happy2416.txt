Reality&trade; meets, er, fantasy.
"That's it. The Japanese are done. They can now return to planet Japania, leaving all the people of Earth horribly confused and scarred for life."  So quoted Kotaku the other day while reviewing a standard two-dimensional fighting game of the Capcom vs. Marvel flavor, only with a twist: your opponent's damage heals unless you can kick or otherwise slide a camera under her skirt and get a shot of her panties.

I was reminded of this quote this afternoon.  Omaha and I are sick and good for little more than sitting around passively absorbing media, although we've been good about keeping the girls occupied without sitting them in front of the television or a console game for hours upon hours.  And I've been doing mostly reading; I'm down to the last ten pages or so of A Soldier Of The Great War.  But what reminded me of this quote was, while I was spending a little time cleaning out the backlog of various video I've got on my laptop, I found a cache of unorganized doujinshi (illustrated fan-fiction, usually done in a manga style and almost always pornographic).  Most of it was around a single theme: the television show Galaxy Angel, but I had to stop at one and laugh.

I haven't watched the show and so am not familiar with the characters.  But halfway through a frentic sex scene the characters stopped, turned to the fourth wall, pulled out a Reality&trade; brand "female condom," and for the next four pages lectured the audience and then demonstrated how to use the darn things.

Heh.  I still think Omaha and I did a better job.  Still, it was fun to see.
