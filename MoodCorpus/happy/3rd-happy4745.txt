the day after christmas whooooo
hey y'all merry belated christmas! lol well I hope everyone had a wonderful christmas!  Yeah so I'm still at my grandma's house and I will be here until early tuesday (or tomorrow lol).  Speaking of tuesday, Engage is back tomorrow! YAY! It's been 2 weeks!  Mom, Dad, and Grandma are sitting here next to me yakking endlessly! haha.  They're talking about Gypsy who keeps hearing her name and popping her head up and looking around.  It's cute!  I saw Isabella yesterday, yay! She's so adorable and she's growing so much and she'll be two in June.  Unfortunately she threw a CD at my head... yeah that hurt.  They didn't discipline her though and now mom and grandma are talking about stuff like that.  Poor Isabella, she had cameras in her face ALL night.  They were trying to pose her and stuff and it wasn't working! of course it wouldn't, she's 18 months old! you can't pose and 18-month-old very well, only for like one or two pictures!  so anyway, last night, I was listening to some of my new cds! I started with lifehouse then listened to switchfoot then I switched to Rent for a while.  I also got phantom of the opera but I didn't listen to that as much (yet).  I have discovered the song "la vie boheme" on the rent cd, I LOVE that song! It's so funny!  Anyway, there's not much to say so I guess I'll say bye bye! haha.
