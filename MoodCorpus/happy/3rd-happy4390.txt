CHRISTMAS!!!!!!!!!!!
MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

well so far everything is going really good this holiday, in fact one of the best i have ever have. Friday night i had the chirstmas party of '05 and it was a shit load of fun. Bob, kari, krysten, and me exchanged our presents, which went really well. got some really cool family guy stuff, and then i got some really nice hugs from the girls, yay for that :D. so after our present deal the rest of the gang came and we had a killer party. we had a few played taps with the koosh ball,we chilled, got all comfortable and relaxed on the couch, and talked and listen to music, and did some weird shit with the lights, had a few mistletoe attacks and yea all that fun stuff. so in the end it was an awesome night. YEAAAA to great friends.

Saturday didn't consist of much for me, woke up at 9, chilled for a while and then it was off to work. Which sucked because it was so busy. It closed at 6 and i didn't get out till 9 because there was a huge mess we had to clean. I missed church and christmas eve dinner, and all that stuff i would have done, oh well i guess thats life, what can you do. So i ended up just going home after work and talking on line till i passed out.

As for today, it is going good. woke up at 10 and chilled watchin tv till my brother woke up. then we decided to open presents. And santa was very good to us this year. robert got NFS most wanted, and lots of guitar stuff. And i got Star wars battle front 2, and the season 1 of Stargate Atlantis, and  i got lots of tool for school so yay to that. after that we ate our dinner deal and now i'm just chillin till i leave to go up to my dad house for part 2 of the present giving. So i guess i'll write more when it happens.

Merry Christmas everyone!!!!!
