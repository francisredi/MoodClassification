the beginning of break
I drove home from texas this weekend.  I got my grades, which are better than expected, and I am home, in my semi-familiar house, living it up.   By living it up I mean sleeping all day, and doing nothing at all.

I don't know if I'll even have a job this break because olive garden has 55 servers working for them now, and that means they probably don't need me.  I'm going to talk to the general manager tomorrow morning.  I have to unpack, and I'm trying to think of xmas presents for everyone.  I have most of the important people done already.

Also, if you are thinking about maybe getting me a present, I have this new idea about giving and getting presents.  Instead of getting semi-decent gifts from about 10 people this year, I would much rather get one or two really really nice gifts that everyone collaborated on.  AKA one of the things I think I might start to tell people is that tiffany, yeah the jewelry store, give gift certificates in gold coins, and you only have to spend like $25 to get a coin.  Therefore, if you want to get me a gift, get me a coin, and then maybe in like 5 years I will be able to get the most amazing diamond you have ever seen.  Not like I'm in to that or anything right?

in other news, I'm actually getting into the holiday spirit, which is a new thing for me.

I can't wait for wednesday night.  i get to see not only my molly, but we are having a french night.  What could be better?!?

here's to my kitty cat gavin, daytime television, and warm weather, kinda,
