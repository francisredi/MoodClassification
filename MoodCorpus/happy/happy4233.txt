Ham sandwiches
A few days ago in an entry called "Incompetence" I wrote of a visit to a prospective employer that consisted entirely of a job application and a written test.  One of the questions on that test went something like this:  "Write a spec for making a ham sandwich including lettuce, fresh tomatoes, mayo and mustard."  I thought it was pretty dumb, but I wrote their silly spec.

Well the recruiter who set me up with the visit called me today and said, "Is this Helen Wheels?  The one who makes such good ham sandwiches?"  It turns out that they were impressed enough with my ham sandwich that they want to call me in for a real interview.  I go in on Friday morning, and I'll be a little bit better prepared for this one.

The company that I interviewed with on Tuesday apparently liked me a lot too, and I'm on their short list of candidates who they will be considering for the position.  And they didn't even ask me ANYthing about ham sandwiches.

In other news on the job front, a company that I've worked for on a part-time temporary basis needs me for another couple of days.  The only trouble is that those days coincide with the last 2 days before we leave for NH.  I talked to the recruiter, and asked if he would talk to they boss there and see if I could telecommute.  There's absolutely nothing that I do there that couldn't be done here, except for perhaps getting the file in the first place.  It's about 20Mb and a little big for email.  That's something that we can overcome, though, I'm sure.  If I could work from home, I could still direct packing and wrapping and getting ready to go on vacation, and still put in an 8-hour day and help them get a good product out.

I spent most of the day with my sister the flight attendant.  I went up to her hotel last night and stayed there since she didn't get in until about midnight.  We packed up a couple of boxes and sent them on to New Hampshire for my brother to pick up, then we went shopping, then we came back to my house, played a game of cards (there's always time for cards), then I took her back to the airport as soon as the girls got home from school.  I'll see her again in 9 days when we get to my brother's house.

I'm getting really excited about my Christmas week trip.  I have LOTS to do, and I have a feeling the next week is going to be REALLY busy.
