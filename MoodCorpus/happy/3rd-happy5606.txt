The day after X'mas... DUM DUM DUM!
It's been a while since I last updated my LJ entry, I know I have another episode of Bad Bahamian Experience that I haven't finished, but since this is the day after the Christmas holiday and people are already in a less than perfect mood, I won't write anything more to take that mood down a notch further.  The ending of my vacation to the Bahamas involved a crazy but nice cab driver who had 5 girlfriends in NY and asked us to be his 6th and 7th one; a duck-taped two propeller air craft that carried us from Nassau to Miami, safely; and a crazy woman who wouldn't stop using her flash on the camera while we are all on a plane. The fact that Y and I got home safely is all it takes for me to put a smile on my face when thinking about this vacation. 

Holidays are slipping away, the New Year's Day is right around the corner and after that, it's nearly 5 months of nothing! I read a letter that's written by a little kid to God, in the letter the kid asked God to put another holiday somewhere in between Christmas and Easter... good thinking kid, good thinking! Looking at next year's calendar, five months of red-less days!  Well... at least we still have the New Year's to think about. 

This Christmas was just like all the other ones in the past years. We sleep, we exchange presents, and we eat! This year, I got a $50 gift card, two sweaters, a dress, a photo frame, a set of nice-smelling beauty products, a home-made pumpkin cake, and couple of books. Wow, now that I summarized it, seems like I did get a lot of things this year.  Of course, my dear parents wanted to go back to the mall on the day after Christmas just to feel the "holiday spirit" and we ended up spending nearly 30 minutes looking for a parking spot.  

All in all, I had a good Christmas, I hope everyone did too. Now it's time to start thinking about a New Year's Resolution... DUM DUM DUM!
