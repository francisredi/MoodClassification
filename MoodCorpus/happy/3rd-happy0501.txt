going home...
So I guess my entire floor is gone.  Couple of guys didnt check out with me- but those are the guys that are never on the floor anyways.  Helped Koki No move out yesterday to go home.  We sat in the lobby for about an hour just kinda emjoying each others presence until her mom showed up- then we all stood outside in the freezing cold for about an hour cracking jokes and all.  It really sucked to see her go, but I was okay thinking that I'd see her in a week or so anyways. But, when we talked last night she said it didnt seem like her mom was very thrilled about her coming to stay with me for a couple weeks.  But, I think I'll go visit her a for a day and try to win over her family so that she can come meet mine.  Hehe we actually got to talk on the phone for a while and it was nice- every time she comes over here it seems she falls asleep in my bed.  But I dont mind because she's so cute when she sleeps ^^ >.<  aww I miss her.  We both kinda laugh about it because even though we've been dating for a short time it seems so much longer since we both had secret crushes on each other for months.
Im glad the semester is over!  So far I got one A and one B and the rest of my grades havent come in yet.  Im expecting a C, maybe one more B, and the rest A's.... But we'll see. I really cant wait to get back to louisville- home Im not as excited about.  I love my family but when I go home I kinda feel like I wanna get up and move and come back to WKU... I think its because Im bored so much at home but when Im here there always seems to be people around.  Well, I guess Im gonna finish packing up my car and see if theres anything I can do about getting outta here before 4.....
