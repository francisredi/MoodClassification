YAY!
I have been having a really good day today, aside from the lack of eating again.&nbsp; Lol.
Anyway, I cleaned my room for the people from the loft company to take pictures of my bed.&nbsp; They were late, but it was ok.
Played SC with Heather and Fox, and then Brandon for a while, I was off to see Last Samurai with Sophia and John.&nbsp; I didn't have a bus pass, and there is no way we could all make it on the scooter, so I borrowed a bus pass from Caroline.&nbsp; Yay.&nbsp; She looks enough like me.
We got there just in time for the movie.&nbsp; Yay for not having to pay for movies!!! =)&nbsp; I cried again.&nbsp; I love that movie!&nbsp; I always think of Nate when I watch it.&nbsp;  I wonder why...&nbsp; if you've seen it, I am sure you understand!
Had to run after the bus on the way back.&nbsp; That was fun.&nbsp; Walked up 5 floors.&nbsp; Probably not good for my knee, but meh, it was fun!
I called Nate after returning the vaccuum, so he and I can talk a bit before we go to bed.&nbsp; He is doing his homework as I type.&nbsp; I should read Oedipus Rex oh well.&nbsp; I will, sometime, before the test tomorrow morning.&nbsp; I have an hour after the first class (chem).
He's my Natee!&nbsp; MINE!&nbsp; He just said so himself!&nbsp; I love that boy so much!&nbsp;&nbsp; We're getting married this summer!&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; He still needs to get divorced from Coni tho...&nbsp; hmm.&nbsp; Oh well, I think that got anulled by both not talking and all, and her not wanting to have anything to do with him anymore.
I can't wait until I get home, back to him, for good.
-Jenna, HIS JENNACON!  FOREVER!
