Party... what party?
Yeah, so last night I expeceted to have a great time with Leah and Lisa and Korin at this party for this guy I work with.  IT SUCKED!  We kinda got a clue when at 7:01 we got a call asking if we were still coming.  Leah and Korin and I were sitting with Lisa in her room while she rushed to get ready (she is always late for everything).  We walked in to see like 12 people sitting in chairs kinda semi-circled talking and music playing but no one even considering dancing.  I should point out we were about 10 minutes late and there were supposed to be like 70 people there.  We all kinda looked at one another and sat down at a table.  We said hi to Jeremy and wished him a happy birthday and felt really bad for him since no one showed up.  We sat and talked while the music played way to loud, I almost had a moment were I yelled how much "fun" I was having as a song ended.  I caught myself though.  Leah and I played with the confetti on the table for an hour until the ink from them ran into our hands.  We all talked until around 8:30 when "Leah's mom called" and I "had to get her hom right away".  We came back to my house, played some ping pong, followed by fooseball followed by a movie, which I shouldn't have let Leah pick; The Wedding Planner.  I took Leah home around 11 and came back and crashed.  All in all the afternoon didn't suck as much as I thought it would after arriving at the "party".  












I'm open to suggestions on what we should all do when we skip on the 22nd to make up for our snow day, hit me up.
