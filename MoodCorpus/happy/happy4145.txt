Just for Mel and my Kris Kringle =):
My Christmas Wish List is really simple!
- SOCKS! colourful, refined, ankle socks, knee length socks, stripes, patterns, singing socks, all kinds of socks!
- chocolate!
- silver jewellry! preferably necklaces... the claire's sorta thing, any kind
- if you happen to be ally and would like to make me a scarf (or commission me a scarf lol from your wonderful mother) you may do so ;)
- umm anything else: mugs, teddy bear, soft things, cute things, philosophical things, clocks, jeremy, mints, body shop items, photo frames, ANYTHING!

Merry Christmas little smurfs everywhere! 

Other than that, Christmas concert was good, the tykes were so small! Some of them played too, the one-handed christmas songs, and they were concentrating so hard to get every note right! aww it was cute! Ally I believe I can come to your party =), but will call you tomorrow just to confirm. I finally got 100% in math, on my quiz! Bout time too... Ironic thing is Fareed didn't! MUHAHAHAHAI scared Jeremy today. We were both in math tutorial but he left before me cuz Farred asked me a question when the bell rang. Anyway I caught up with him going to 
Bio, and went up and said, "HI!" rather enthusiastically; he looked up startled. I think he was lost in his thoughts, but he started a conversation right away so it didn't feel too awkward... Note to self: Must restrain enthusiasm!!!
