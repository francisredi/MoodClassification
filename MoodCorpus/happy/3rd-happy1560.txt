Fall 2005 update!
The semester is over!  This semester was soooo stressful!  I've got some grades back and it looks to be possibly my best semester grade wise.  Derrick's such a good student that he helped me get on the ball and do my assignments from the get-go.  Also, I lived in a three bedroom apartment, with five other girls.  Dude, there was much conflict.  The interpersonal communication class I took this semseter was a life saver.  The chapters on emotions and conflict management were especially helpful.  Without going into too much detail, I had massive beef with one roommate and it got especially bad around finals time.  But the concepts about conflict management helped me resolve the conflict.  Today we sat down and actually talked about it!  I felt so mature!  There were hurt feelings and tears but by the time my roommate left to go home we hugged.  We were barely talking to each other during finals week.  Man, communication is great.  I'm so glad I picked up a communication concentration.  Oh another great perspective giving book that we read for that class was "Life Together" by Dietrich Bonehoffer.  One quote of his that will stick with me forever (paraphrased) is "Everyone could use a little more grace, a little more forgiveness, more understanding, but no one would benefit from being judged."
