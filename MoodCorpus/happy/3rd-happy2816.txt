Sweeet09
Well not really too much to update on.  I didn't have to do the 25 miler thank god.  It got completly cancelled due to the fact that it was like in the negatives temperature wise and we are so close to deployment we can't afford any injuries.  I'm glad because it would have sucked walking forever and being in the below zero cold for 10 hours.  I get to talk to Mike alot more now, he's got personal internet over in Iraq.  The time difference is 8 hours ahead over there so our times don't always match up but at least I can be way more updated and don't have to worry so much.  He's doing really well over there and things are picking up for him and he's not so bored.  Hopefully he will have Christmas off.  I've only got a few more days left till I'm finally back in Jersey.  Christmas Eve I'll be back and I can't wait.  I'm stopping by Sam's house in PA on the way down, I haven't seen him in forever.  I'm also looking forward to just seeing everyone one last time before I'm off to the Ghan.  I've only got one more day of work tomorrow before block leave starts.  We all really need this break.  Getting a bit restless around here.  Oh and it's been snowing like non friggin stop, every damn day.  It's way way more then last year already it's crazy.  Hopefully I'll have good weather for my travel, although I heard Jersey is getting barely any snow.  Well I gotta be heading off to bed now.  Tomorrow all of the fisters are getting together for our cohesion event.  We are all gonna go out bowling and it should be pretty fun.  I think that's it, still nothing exciting yet.  End.
