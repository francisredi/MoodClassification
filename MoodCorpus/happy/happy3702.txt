A snowy winter day!
And now I can truly say, one semester done, only one more to go.  

The idea of graduating is somewhat beyond my grasp yet.  Like I can picture myself at the ceremony with my cap and gown and getting my degree.  I can see a nice spring day, and my family smiling and laughing around me and us posing for many pictures.  I can feel the relief of having no more classes, but I guess this all also brings up the question of what is next for me.  

And truly my options are nearly limitless.  Transition time are always exciting and scary too.  

Today was a fun day.  Classes were actually cancelled and the school was closed because of the weather, but her I am at work anyway, because I am essential staff.  Rumor is I get a higher pay differential for the hours that I work when the school is closed, but I have not confirmed that yet.  It would be exciting to say that least.  It is going to be a challenge to keep myself occupied for the next 8 hours.  I already looked through my email inbox of forwards and fun stuff.  I'm sure the internet will keep me busy for a while, plus I have a magazine to read and I brought two books in, so I have my choice of stories.  

I slept in, and spent the afternoon wrapping presents and feeling lots of holiday cheer.  My house is a bit of a mess, and there are tons of things I should of course be doing, but I'm on break.  I am actually excited for next week, because I am working 8-5 Monday through Friday, so I will get to tease myself with all the prime time shows that I don't usually get to see.  I'm looking forward to it.  

Otherwise not much else is going on.  I'm very excited for Christmas, only 11 more days to go.  I can't wait to go home and be merry with my family, and because Josh is coming home and he is going to meet mom and dad and Emily, and then I get to spend New Year's with Josh, yayayaya.  I am such a lucky girl.
