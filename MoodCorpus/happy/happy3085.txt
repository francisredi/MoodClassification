Holy Crap!!!
i looked at my mail this morning prior to coming into the office and got the surprise of my life. i've been waiting for this to come for months and i finally...FINALLY...got approval from my health insurance company to have weight loss surgery. i'm on freaking cloud 9 today! 

this had to be one of the hardest decisions of my life, i've agonized and vascilated about it for over 2 years and it finally came down to, do i want to continue to struggle and feel shitty at the weight i'm at? or do i want to take control of my life, get help in the form of this tool and get back to what i love to do? obviously i finally chose the latter. but it hasn't been without its disappointments, most of my family is being supportive, my mom is so totally anti-wls though that it hurts. she doesn't understand just how painfully difficult this has been for me, how much soul searching i've done and how many discussions i've had with my therapist over it. i'm not taking this lightly or doing it on a whim. i wish she understood that, but she doesn't. maybe she'd understand better if she was stuck at 320lbs, but i don't think she'll ever understand what thats like. alright, all this talk is taking me down from my high. 

this is truly one of the final steps towards giving myself a new beginning. i'm looking forward to this greatly.
