Test Day 1.0
Well, today has actually turned out pretty decent.  Still the government things is pissing me off, but otherwise life's good.  Got 3 days of R&R while I was sick before coming to school for finals.  All of my tests so far have gone a WHOLE lot better then expected.  Saw "King Kong" for my dad's birthday celebration, my brother is now an offical Boy Scout as of Friday, crossing the bridge and getting the 'arrow of light' and all. AND, I missed the band concert. -big grin- Fun all around. Plus, Max apologized to me today, in note form of course, but still. Dunno how I should feel. It just confuses me right now cause of my fuzzy brain. Being sick and all. But thankfully, I have David and Heery to sort me out, ne? :)

Stayed after school too to work on that retar- STUPID Indiana packet. Geez. I wouldn't even have gotten halfway done if I hadn't decided to be a cheater and steal Katelyn's paper, copied ALL of the answers. I felt bad for like two seconds, then it went away, and I got worried that bitch of a teacher would notice the extra packet on my desk. Needless to say, she didn't. Praishee the Lord and Hallejuah! Isn't that sad, I don't even know how to spell that word.

Anyway, my hand still hurts from writing furiously for an hour and a half straight. -sighs- So, think I'll go do something else now. David's letting me borrow a futuristic X-men/Spiderman book, and his X-men Legends PS2 game. Woo, fun for the holidays.

By the way, did you know that every time someone says "happy holidays" somewhere in the world an elf falls down dead? You can save them by jingling bells if anyone ever says it. Help prevent elf deaths, say "Merry Christmas!"
