Happy Thursday!
Glad to see you lot are enjoying yourselves in my absence ^_^ Waiting for the chimney sweep at the moment, so I have a few minutes, and figured I'd babble briefly here, as I won't have time to answer all my Elfy comments properly.

Until I do, thank you *hugs* you lot are so lovely.

Oh, Shanra, I got my cd this morning - the misinterpreted your handwriting as 72, rather than 42, so I guess the other one must have gone the same way. Here's hoping I'll get it at some point. If not, I guess I'll have to go door knocking *muhahaha*

As Joelle asked, Taffy's not great - he's eating, which is brilliant, but he got far too hot last night, poor lamb, and just sort of flaked wherever I put him. He spent the whole night on my windowsill, which he never does. Have to give him another jab, and hope it perks him up. Sadly we have to keep the heating on all the time for Niamh, which doesn't help.

Other than that, glad you're all enjoying your Narnia discussion ^_^ I can't remember anything about them - I only read them once when I was about seven - but I'm getting them all for christmas, so that should sort me out.

Anyway, if you want to move it over here, before the replies get too narrow, you're more than welcome. Or if you want to discuss anything else (movies versus books, why spiders have eightlegs, which is the way to Amarillo...) feel free ^_^ 

Happy Thursday, ducklings!
