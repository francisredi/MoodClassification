WEEEEEEEE!!!!
Heya all, Today was a great day! I had tons of fun :D I first got a new Wisconsin ID card this morning, then went to the mall got some music and stuff there. After that, I went I meet my dad at his apartment and when I got there I hanged around there for a couple of hours cause he was waiting for his cleaning lady but she never showed up so we left and headed up by my work cause I had to pick up my paycheck. So, then later on we went to wal*mart and I got christmas presents early. I got that new Red DS with mario Kart! :D and guess what I was able to get a phone for free!!!! I was so happy! I wanted a phone so bad cause I hated being without one. So, I also bought some Pjs and some jeans, but the funny thing is that when my sis found out what kind of Pjs I bought he was mad cause she just bought the exact same ones for me for christmas!! I was like dammit I didn't know! lol.. but it was cool she said she will just take them back and get me something else.. lol...anyways, my dad and I went there for a couple of hours or more cause we were activiting our phones and yes I said "our" cause dad was able to get a free phone too. :)

So, finally when we were all done, we took the bus together and he went home and I went home. I thought today was great day :)

When I got home it was too long and chris came home and he was happy too cause he got his speakers in the mail today.

I am still waiting for my package I ordered, it was some vegan food :) Anyways, that was my day.. TTFN! :)
