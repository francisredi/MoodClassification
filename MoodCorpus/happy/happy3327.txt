the cow says...
IM DONE WITH SCHOOL HUZZAH...... well, yknow, at least this semester ^^; cant wait til i can say that again WITHOUT the suffix clause. wah. stupid prof saba, i couldve SWORN she said the final was gonna be all multiple choice, but it was all true/false... blech! i hate that cuz she uses VERY ambiguous wording, and as we all know, that is the kiss of death on true/false questions. for example, whereas "good communication skills can improve a relationship" may be true, "good communication skills will always improve a relationship" may be false. yknow? i hate those little nuances... but overall i feel... okay... and thats a good sign. the better i feel about a test, the worse i do, and vice versa hahahahaha i only needed to pull a high D to pass, so i was shooting for a C ^^; 

heh, i was watching 'romeo & juliet' whilst eating dinner - the one with leo dicaprio and claire danes - and i noticed that the guy who plays mercutio in that is a character in OZ hahahaha how amusing. i was eating a bean & cheese burrito from robertos while i was watching that, and all the cats were huddled around me, staring and purring, bless their little cotton socks hehehehe

no SVU tonight :( now im incredibly sad because i havent seen it since FRIDAY and im getting very antsy about that... RRRRRRRRR.

doug called me and asked me to take his shift on sunday cuz he got a second job working at the civic center, being a ticket-boy for the lion king show! I WANNA SEE THAT *WEEPS* anyways, i said sure since im calling in sick on friday, and i dont wanna be TOO short on my paycheck. heather loves her days off, but i figure ive got thursday all to myself, so thats good enough :D maybe ill try to go visit my dad or something, havent been up there since my birthday, i think O_o
