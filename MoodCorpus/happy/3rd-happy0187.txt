This and That... 
Ok, so my surgery is set for Jan 6. I don't know what time yet because my doctor didn't fill out the right  forms and the lady who schedules the surgery's said she had to check with him and call me back. This is going well so far... :(

Other than that, things are good. The repair man is here to FINALLY fix our disabled toliet! YAY! More than one person will get to use it per 4 hour time period!!!! (it's the little things in life!) I finished all my Christmas shopping and last night, I wrapped my last few presents! This is very exciting! I've been so on top of things this year!

Things with Clayton are absolutely wonderful! For those of you who are interested and aren't on my friends list, we have some exciting news! I don't want to put it on here yet to share with the entire world, but if you want to know the juicy details, let me know!

I made out a list of New Year's resolutions today. Clayton and I have been talking about resolutions a lot lately and we have a whole lot to accomplish this year! I think I'm going to make a spreadsheet of everything and make about 38 copies so I can post them everywhere so we don't loose sight of our goals! Among others, a few things we are going to be working on:

* Start working out again- (my doctor has been pleading with me on this one because of all my health issues)
* Save every penny we can!!!! This is very important! NO MORE EATING OUT AND SHOPPING!!
*Start looking for an Apartment - I have to move out of the dorms once spring semester is over, so I need to have a place lined up so I don't become homeless.
* Make decisions! - we have a lot of things to decide on this year, so we need to sit down and actually DECIDE!
* Look for a church- something we've been talking about lately
* Take my vitamins EVERYDAY! -I'm terrible with this but also something my doctor has been on my case about


That's most of them. It's going to be a busy/crazy year but I am SO looking forward to it!! I feel like I have the everything in the world to look forward to!!   I leave for Virginia next week to spend time with my family for Christmas! I am really excited! Hopefully we'll have good weather for travelling!!

I suppose that's all for now. I need to get up and get some of my massive amounts of laundry done!!! ugh...
