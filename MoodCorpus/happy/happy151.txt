Partnership
I've been invited to a friend's wedding on December 21st. The unusual thing being that this is actually a Civil Partnership ceremony between two male friends of mine. 21st December is the first day in the UK that they can legally register their partnership and they've asked me and my husband to be their witnesses. They've been a couple for about nine years so in some ways it's a bit of an anti-climax and they certainly don't need a piece of paper to prove their commitment to each other. The important thing is that by registering their partnership they get all the rights that us heterosexual couples have always had.

But what do you where to a gay wedding? They've decided that they don't want to make a big fuss about it, so it's only going to be a small affair. In fact, the law as it stands doesn't even have any sort of ceremony attached to the signing of the paperwork. If you want a ceremony you have to pay extra, quite a lot extra. They've said no gifts and no guests at the signing, but we'll be throwing a party afterwards. They've said that they're only doing it for the legal reasons but I know that it secretly means a lot to them that they're making a formal commitment.

I decided that I needed to buy them a card, but trying to find any sort of appropriate congratulations card has just been a nightmare. They're horribly twee or covered in rainbow symbols. It's never been a big thing that my two friends are gay and I don't want to make it a big thing by giving them a rainbow coloured card. I was expecting that all the card shops would be cashing in on the expected boom in gay weddings but so far they seem to be missing out on this market. The best I've been able to come up with is a blank card with a picture of two very happy looking, probably lovestruck, cats on it.

Even if it is only a bit of paper, I'm still excited by the whole thing.
