Amazing Weekend for Pepper
So here I am in the middle of the afternoon at home, sick and dying, and still wanting nothing but a great night with Pez and some awesome local music. If you're not coming and can/want to (which you know you do) then I expect to see you there. It's gonna be amazing and I'm super excited.

Tomorrow night is also going to be wonderful because it's Winter Ball!! I, unfortunately, am not going with Jared cuz that didn't work out as planned (long story). But I am going to go and scam on everyone else's dates and dance with who ever I please all night long. It's going to be amazing. 

The saddest thing ever, though, is that I can't go to dinner with Amanda and her group. Because I'm sick, my mommy said no to dinner and no to getting ready at Megan's but yes to the dance and yes to after-party/post-dance activities. Why? I don't know, but she did. I guess she just wants me stay close to home. Well at least my beautiful dress and perfectly good dance ticket won't go to waste despite my current ill state. I am extremely sad that I can't go with Amanda (love you!) but at least I still get to go to Winter Ball. I am sooo stoked! I will be sure to regale you all with my amazing tale of Winter Ball sometime next week.

Other than that, life is amazing. I'm going to college, my sisters come home soon, I have the BEST 3rd period class ever (yay SnSO), and I have absolutely amazing friends (go you). Life is pretty damn good. Well, for the time being at least. Love you tons, have good weekend and I'll catch ya on the flip side. Love and kisses and ttfn.

Pepper :)
