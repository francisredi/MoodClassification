Tis' the Season!!!
Hi y'all---

oh, it's been awhile since I've randomly babbled on here, eh?  Well, it's been pretty busy for me around here since fall quarter ended.  Just to quickly review: Thanksgiving was great!!!!!!! So much good food, and the one left-overs I didn't getting sick of having for multiple days. lol  Since then, I've basically been busy just running around, and now getting things for Christmas, which is only a week away. Oh, I love this time of year, despite the Ch-ch-ch-chia pet commercials every 2.5 seconds. ;P It's just so wonderful!!!!!  

Ya know, I've got no idea what and when I doing anything on Christmas yet. It's usually a 3 day thing though. 23rd is preparation, as is the first half of Christmas eve, followed by a Christmas party with family and presents, the meal and such, followed by all that again on Christmas day.  

I have no idea what I'm doing for new years either, but I don't care about that. New Years is just another day to me. No big.  To be perfectly honest, I've never really done much on New Year's Eve, usually sit at home, might watch the ball drop if nothing better is on, usually with at least one friend or family member.  But again, I just don't see the big deal about all of it.  

Ya'know, seeing as how it's been awhile, I had a lot more to write but my mind just went totally blank. Oh, the Cleveland Browns won today!!!!!! Go, team!!!!! 

Anywho....Merry Christmas everyone!!! I hope you all have a great holiday season, and I'll hopefully see some of you soon!!!!! Love, Peace and Joy!!!

~~~~Until I think of somethin' else to type about, Merry Christmas!!!!~~~~~~
