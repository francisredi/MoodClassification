the calm before the storm...
My Thanksgiving was sorta crazy. Since it wasnt at my house this year and the friends we eat with were in Germany, it just wasnt the same. The only thing that stayed the same was me getting a little too excited watching David Letterman, because you get to "guess the pie" and I have been guessing since I was little. This year I was totally off, I guessed pecan and rasberry but it was pumpkin and blueberry. Oh well, I get to guess again next year. This week is going to be insane. Im excited about christmas already...we have a mini tree in our room and its adorable. The room looks so pretty when there are no lights on except the twinkle lights on the tree. Last night, Katie and I watched Grey's Anatomy, I love that show, its so real, it gives a thought provoking message at the end and I love that. I have 3 mangos sitting, waiting to get ripe and I cant wait to eat them, they look yummy! I missed watching RENT. I was sad, but I will see it first thing when I get home for christmas break. Alot of people gave it bad reviews but I think you need a certain apprecitaion and respect for musicals and the effort it takes to put them together. One day, when I make it to lovely New York I can see whatever I want on Broadway and it will be fabulous. Today my spanish teacher made me watch this movie and it was a girl giving a guy head for about a minute. It was weird, my teacher makes us watch all these crazy movies lately. This entry is so random but I have deeper stuff to wrtie about, I just need to figure it out first.
