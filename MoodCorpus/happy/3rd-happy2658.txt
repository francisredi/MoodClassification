Done. For now.
Phew. Finally done. I was especially unmotivated for this last exam, but thankfully it was pretty straightforward and I finished quite quickly. 

So, what to say about this semester? Well, I've had no major bouts of depression so that's a good sign. Yet, there's still a small feeling of emptiness and I've had plenty of those meta-conscious episodes asking, "what the hell am I doing here"? The existential battle of mine raves on. M'eh, I can't ever put my finger on it, and I won't devote any more effort in search of discovering my deep, internal problems. I'll let my future therapist do that. 

I'm coming home tomorrow morning, for a about a week or so. I don't have many plans, except a few involving gasoline, shoes, brainstorming, and plain yogurt. Let your imagination run wild. 

Oh, and Bush spied on me. I want to get a shirt with that written on it. You know, I rarely talk about politics let alone write about them, because I admit my naivite and ignorance, but now, I really must just say I hate Bush. I really do. I don't understand why we can't impeach him. Hasn't he broken several fundamental constitutional laws? He should be fired for sheer performance failure. I mean, the presidency is a job, no? I would continue, but I'll spare you the ineloquent ridicule. It's clear how I stand.
