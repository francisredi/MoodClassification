Well and alive
Helo all,
Yeah I have been missing in action for abit. I was out of civilisation camping&nbsp;out at&nbsp;the countryside. It was beautiful, as we were camping beside a river, in Colly's (Michael's aunt) paddock in this town named Wangaratta. There were 2 amazing and pretty horses that they owned for the past 20+ years. Yes I know that their town and street names can get quite aboriginal. But the country side was beautiful, with really fresh air and food. Night time sky was filled up with the glitter of stars shining so clearly! We caught a few shooting stars and a huge orange meteor slowly moving through. That was awesome. We built a few campfires and roasted a few yummy marshmallows. =)
The area is known as gourmet food region - and we did our part sampling and visiting the area.&nbsp;There was the&nbsp;Brown Brothers wineries, a mustard factory, cheese factory (yummy cheese tasting), and honey farm. The rest of the time was spend at Colly's as she had been the perfect host, always lending us her place for a pitstop to cleanup and rest.
Well, there is nothing big happening, except that Christmas is approaching and time to get ready for Christmas shopping! I am finding it especially hard to buy pressies for Michael's family members. Hope you guys (ahem gals) have been doing well and not letting anything else affect your festive mood! Got to go...
Lots of love,
