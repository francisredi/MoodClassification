truly the most wonderful time of the year
Happy Christmas!
After having dinner with my titos and titas both from here and from San Francisco, and after hearing mass in Santuario de San Antonio, and after having hot chocolate in Hotel InterContinental, I'm back home. And even if the morning and the afternoon were boring, tonight was a good night. Jess, You really work wonders.
Tonight, my brothers and I talked about everything and anything. We hardly fight now. Not that we majorly did before, but it's just nice to share each others lives. Kuya even mentioned that he wanted to quit smoking soon. That's pretty much the best Christmas gift I've gotten so far. Tonight, it felt amazing to be part of the family I'm in. Not because of the extended family that was present but really because of my brothers and my parents. There's just this amazing feeling that rushed to my heart, and it's still rushing. It's a little of belongingness, wholeness, contentment, gratitude, and love. I absolutely love being a Lucero. Every single day of the year. Tonight, it felt great to go to mass as a complete family. It hasn't happened for a long time. All 5 of us in one church. And it's even more amazing that there are so many things to be thankful for this day, this week, this month, this year. Jess, I felt You tonight. Happy Birthday. :) You throw one heck of a celebration. I love you. Basta ikaw.
