Wicked Winter Renaissance Faire


Jeff Mach's Wicked Winter Renaissance Faire is a slightly twisted Renaissance/fantasy fair. It's like stepping into a time machine and going back several hundred years...if the past was a little darker, a little funnier, a little weirder, and a touch more perverse.

We are 100% indoors (who holds an event outdoors in New Jersey, in February?)

We'll feature delicious foods, many of which are Renaissance-style, and others which are simply unique. We're the home to over eighty vendors as of this writing, and we look to have over a hundred-twenty by the date of the Faire--each one offering wares that are unique, interesting, and representing a huge variety of interests, from medieval, to gothic, to pagan, to artistic, to the just plain unusual.

We also offer incredible entertainment. I mean, a lot of entertainment. Our headlining act is Voltaire, a musician of sardonic black humor and axe-sharp wit... A motley crew of musical acts, jugglers, acrobats, magicians, comedians, dancers and others are now assembled - and more are still coming.

The event will take place on Saturday, February 11th, 2006, from 12 noon to midnight. Admission is $15. The event takes place at The New Jersey Convention and Expo Center, in Edison, New Jersey.
