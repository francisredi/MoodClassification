Arizona!
My parents are completely nuts... I have no idea why they want to leave Arizona.  Well, I do (jobs, house is too big, etc.).  But the weather now is absolutely perfect.  The high yesterday was 77 degrees - yes, 77!  It's gorgeous.  Normally the highs are in the upper 60's and low 70's, so this is just perfect.

Haven't been doing a whole lot recently, just relaxing.  Unpacked my clothes and suitcases, cleaned out my closet of clothes I didn't wear any more and will donate to the Salvation Army, bought almost all my books for next semester - 5 books so far were about $230, so not too horrible yet.  Still need one more.  Posted all of my pictures on ImageStation as well as some of the ISU pictures on facebook.  I think I'm totally falling for this woman (Kimberly Martin).  We met through a mutual friend... we've been out in groups a couple times at the bar, bowling, etc.  She kind of asked me out via facebook (she said "let me know when you get back from break and maybe we can hang out or something," which is more courage than I have), so we'll probably get together for dinner or something after I get back (which now seems like an eternity).  We've emailed back and forth every day or two... So hopefully something may develop out of that :).

I'm searching around for a pair of headphones for my dad for Christmas, and will go donate blood probably tomorrow.  I haven't been able to donate for the past 12 months since I traveled into Vietnam and Cambodia last December (areas with Malaria).  But now I'm free and clear, so should be able to go do that again.  I'm going to try and get in a better habit of doing that every 2 months, which is the most often you can donate.  It's a really good thing to do.
