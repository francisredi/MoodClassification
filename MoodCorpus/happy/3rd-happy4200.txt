Merry Christmas
Wade and I are getting final chores done here at home. The taxi will be picking us up in a couple of hours for the trip to the airport and then to Phoenix via San Francisco. We'll be enjoying the warm climate there (79 degrees yesterday) and the company of Wade's friends and then home again on Wednesday.

We attended Christmas Eve service at church last night. Wade sang in the half hour organ concert before the service. I read the call to worship and one of the scripture readings from Luke. And, at the last minute, was asked to run the lights for the service, which mercifully were set on programmed settings (at Hymm X, push button 2, etc). The message of the homily was grace, something that has also been on my mind lately. We got home and in bed by 12:30.

Wade's folks sent me a Christmas gift this year, which was a nice surprise in and of itself. But greater than the actual gift was the card included which said "To David, Love Barry and Shirley." I'm sure there's a measure of holiday politeness in that, but it was voluntary and shows a lot of progress for conservative religious Republican folk in the span of just over a year and a half since Wade's coming out.

I hope all my friends and family find warmth and happiness in this, the season of good will and gladness. No matter your spiritual orientation, please receive my warmest and most genuine wish for love in your lives, the joy of friendship, and the approach of a new year that I pray will bring you peace and prosperity.
