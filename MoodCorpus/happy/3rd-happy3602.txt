Christmas is coming! Christmas is coming! I'm so excited.
I only have one gift left to get, then the hussle will be over.
Last Friday my friend Holly and I catered a Christmas party for a lady in our church. This house had a theater and a game room complete with a pool table, it was huge. We had to cook food and put it all on plates and make them look nice. Other than running around in heels for 7 hours, we pretty much got paid for a social event. How awesome! I got paid good too($100), then it all went to Christmas presents which worked out great.
I think I'm gonna marry a salesman someday, just because they're so outgoing and fun that no matter who you are they'll come up and and introduce themselves, say hello and pretend to be interested in talking to you. Not to mention they stream out with compliments. I don't want them to lie to me but I like honest confident friendly guys.
One time I was in Tampa with my mom at some rattlesnake place and this man was hitting on my mom and I completely struck a conversation with him and my mom barely spoke cuz she wasn't interested and all.
"I have to watch out for flattery it might just be the end of me."
I had a lot of fun shopping with my dad today, I like being on the loop of what gifts everyone is getting, hehe.
We went bowling today, and I stink so bad at bowling lol. The first game I got a 90, and the second game I got a 57! That's horrible hehe, my dad's friend came when I was playing the second game and he's this great bowler who plays with my dad in his league... he was laughing at me lol.
This whole break thing is not working when it comes to sleep. I get really hyper just before I go to bed and I can't fall asleep. Last night I was up to 4 or 4:30 in the morning! good thing I have time to sleep in.
My tree's all up and decorated how pretty and the presents are piling up. Only, 3 more days. Yay, Jesus' birthday! God is good. :) MERRY CHRISTMAS!
