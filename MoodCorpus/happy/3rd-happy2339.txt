Life is a bit frantic, but entertaining.  I spent last week working 13 hours days/nights getting this report ready b/c it's my first major deliverable and I thought it was going to all the top brass in draft form.  Turns out the plan changed dramatically and I just sent some field people some charts/graphs, while all of my beautiful text and conclusions await further polishing before release.  All my bosses are kind of kissing my ass about it though, since they feel bad about how hard I worked and they like the result.

Weekend was great, I spent some time hanging out with a high-quality and relatively new friend.  We went to a tavern with bluegrass night Friday, then a compassion over killing fundraiser saturday.  I rocked a tux, and bought this print in a silent auction (please ignore the orange reflection of me and camera):

It's of one of my favorites pieces of local outdoor art.  All in all, a fantastic two nights was had.  Today was my brother's birthday so we went to see the Narnia movie with the family, ate some good food, made a cake, etc.

AND!  Cathy (my former officemate and all-around entertaining and awesome gal) is coming to visit with her husband tomorrow night for a day or so (though escaping work will be difficult to impossible tuesday).  Then I'm off to florida for a christmas eve experience of belly rubs at a potbellied pig sanctuary.

Things are very dense with interestingness for a change, and the timing with busy work is non-ideal, but it's energizing natheless.  Though some sleep sounds awfull good right about now...
