i passed stats!!!
Whatever was going on with Todd is now over. He's a great guy and has a lot going for him (25, owns his own business, truck, cottage etc) and we're still friends, but we're clearly looking for different things and we're in completely different places. He took things way too fast, not physically but emotionally and in terms of our status. He was already talking about "our relationship" when we met, what? a week ago? He said he's glad we talked about it now rather than a month down the road... but what would have happened in a month?! We would've been friends for a whole 36 days, so I'm locked in!? Don't talk to me about marriage a week after we've met and expect me not to freak out and run the other way.Mom and I established a new form of trust last night. A friend really wanted me to come over for legitimite reasons...at 1:30am. I gave her vague details as to who he was and where he lived and that I'd be home in a few hours...and she let me go. It really was innocent, I was just a little surprised that she let me take off for a guy's house that she didn't know in the middle of the night. Guess it would make more sense if you knew the obsessive protectiveness that my Mom smothers me with.So Justin gave me a dozen roses the other day for Christmas. I told him I wanted them awhile back but I didn't actually think he would. He brought them to work my too, my boss was teasing me and it was a little hard to explain. In the words of my sister "you two are royally fucked."
