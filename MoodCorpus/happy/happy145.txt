I'm Getting Married!
So lately I've been extremely fed up with living with my mother, not having my own space,not having any privacy, and having people disrepect my things. I've actually been quite depressed these past few days and I cried so much yesterday that I cuoldn't take it anymore. I tought a lot about my situation today and I thought of how there's no point in sitting around upset. If something's wrong fixt it. I decided that no matter what it takes I must move out this upcoming year. The reality of moving out is that I can't afford to be on my own with no roomates. The problem with that is that I have no one to become my roomate. I kept thinking it would just be perfect if I could live with John since he's moving out anyway, we both want our freedom.
 I also thought of how I want to get out of Miami and I thought maybe we could move to St. Luis where his family lives. He's wanted to move there for so long and I've held him back and I feel horrible because he is miserable here. So I asked him what the expense of living is up there and he kept asking me why I wanted to know that. He didn't believe me when I said I was just curious and he got really excited that I want to move up there. I told him the one problem with that was what the problem has always been, the fact that we are not married. He said "lets get maried then!" I was very shocked and everything after that seemed to be a dreamy blurr.
 He admitted that he was planning on saving money after christmas for a ring. And we were huggy and I remember him saying "so will you marry me?"
 I've been in shock ever since I don't think i'ts hit me fully yet even though we already looked at some rings today and my family knows.
 We plan on saving from now until summer in order to have a small wedding in St. Luis. It's going to be super simple. His grandpa will marry us and we'll have a pot-luck and I'm getting a cheapdress from David's Bridal. We want to rent an apartment up there and live there.
