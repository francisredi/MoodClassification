you know what this reminds me of? my icelandic boyhood.
Worked out, yay me!  Had a nice long go on the strider (heh) then some weights, which, hi, on the ab thingy?  I can do more than my body-weight, which is up to 115 by the way, yay!

Now, must go shops and buy more cards, as I ran out yesterday and am only half done.  It's very hard being as awesome as I am; everyone wants holiday cards from you and your wrist starts to hurt after so many and you spend lots of money on cards.  Sigh.  That is the price of awesomeness, I suppose.  Anyway, if your card from me gets there late, I apologize but really it's never too late for holiday cheer, is it?  Of course not.

Running errands all day will also keep me out of the house, which is good, as the grandfather is coming this week and that means we all go crazy and decompensate whilst getting the house clean.

I got stuff going overseas sent out a week or so ago, so hopefully those shouldn't arrive too horribly late, and hopefully most of these will arrive within a few days.

Hopefully shall get some shopping done as well; need to get friends' gifts though family are all taken care of.

Also, GIP.  Because I really have a fondness for the Buffybot.  She's so sweet and earnest and to me, sad.  And really, is this not the perfect icon for when I'm feeling bouncy?
