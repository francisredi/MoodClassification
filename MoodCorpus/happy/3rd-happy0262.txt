Have YOU discovered the grace of God?
Today was an adventure. Since the Dad and some others and I are going on vacay later in break, he arranged for me to fly from Minneapolis with like a 3 week delay in Milwaukee first, i.e. I flew home today. Quite high class, I know. I even spluged for a cab to the airport since I didn't think I could manage all my crap on the bus, then the light rail. Long story short, cab driver dropped me off in the wrong place and I ended up taking the light rail and walking a million miles with my crap anyways. There were four major wipeouts and I'm pretty sure this is the reason my laptop's being weird now. Almost missed my flight which was bad. Sat by a very nice lady which was good. More people should be more friendly :)

Got home and found that there are Christmas decorations in the living room?!? What?! We haven't done anything since I was in elementary school and now all of a sudden the parentals dig it all up? Then my mom COOKED dinner... weirdness. They seem to be on the "we missed you our dear college student so we're going to do lots of extra things to make you feel at home" kick. That's fine with me.

Oh and 43/50 on bio exam so perhaps the studying paid off :) It was however at the cost of my calculus grade as I bombed that final. I need a C minus in it for biochem or it's calc 2 for the THIRD TIME!!! Cross your fingers everyone. The lit paper I turned in is awful and I know it. Genetics should be decent. But you know what? I'm done and there is an entire MONTH to sit around and pretend that grades do not exist! :)
