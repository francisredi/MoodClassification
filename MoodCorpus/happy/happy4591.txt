Birthday Surprise
Lisa arranged to meet me tonight on the northbound platform of the Northern Line to take me on my birthday surprise, given the meeting point I thought it might've been a night in The Dev or the Edward Scissorhands ballet at Sadlers Wells. 

These ideas went out the window when we changed platforms at Bank. It was then I correctly guessed we were doing the candlelit evening at Dennis Severs House. We'd been before during the summer and back then thought it would be interesting to come back at night. 

The chap who runs the place recognised us the moment we arrived, which was nice. Fortunately, there weren't too many people visiting the place so we could browse at our own pace without feeling that we were intruding on other peoples' enjoyment.

Normally, one wouldn't be able to touch stuff, but part of tonight's experience included being able to sit round the open fire in the room of your choice, supping wine. I decided that I liked the idea of doing this within the tableau of this William Hogarth painting. The resident cat even came up to say hello (having reacquainted myself with her earlier in the evening).

We supped several glasses of mulled wine, graciously supplied by the "manager" (for want of a better word), just before we left we were given presents from under the Christmas tree (a book and DVD of the house). 

A fabulous evening and such a wonderful present, thank you Lisa. :-)

One thing I don't like about this year is having to travel with pissed people coming from office parties... one girl was on the phone all the way home talking to a colleague about work related issues. She did make me grin when she was describing how she went to the wrong office party venue!
 
Now off to bed to get some kind of rest before battling with work tomorrow (I have to apologise now, I'm not keeping up with LJ at all at the moment, we're now entering into our busiest period).
