Merry Christmas!
We had some very good news yesterday.  In July my grandfather was given six months to live because he has cancer of the esophagus (his third stint with some kind of cancer in my lifetime).  They decided to treat him anyways, so he did radiation and now he is once again in remission and doesn't have to see the doctors in Toronto until May.  In the slighly insensitive words of my dad:  Grandpa is good at cancer.
Needless to say, I'm very relieved that he's okay, and it's nice to see him comfortable and happy and most importantly, gaining weight.

Tonight is daddy birthday party night!  This is my favourite night of the holidays just because my dad's birthday dinner is always the most hilarious meal, we get more family inside jokes from this one meal than from the rest of the year combined.  It's a really nice way to start Christmas off, because it's my whole family together with no outsiders just having fun and spending time together.

The pressure in my leg and back is becoming unbearable.  I don't like that I'm starting to have to rely on tylenol etc to be comfortabe because I never do that.  Even when I'm sick I refuse to take any kind of drugs because I prefer to just let my body beat it.  It's very wrong that I'm actually excited to have surgery just because it won't hurt anymore.
I have no idea how I'm going to survive sitting on the train for nine hours for the trip back to stinking London.
