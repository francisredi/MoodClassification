I can POST!!
OK, somehow through the magic of Christmas, when I logged on today - I can post again! So, I'll try not to make this too incredibly long, but...

Christmas Eve had its ups and downs...we went to AA and delivered gifts to my brother and his family - short trip, but very nice. Then Nick went off to his girlfriends big family celebration - home at about midnight. So it was very quiet at our house, with Larry wraping like a mad man in the dining room - with the door closed, while I watched movies and got everything ready for the morning.

Christmas was fun - as always - but a little too quiet for my tastes - I'd like it better if there were a bunch of excited kids running around - But even though it was just the three of us for most of the day we still had a really good time. Nick was totally suprised with his varsity jacket - and (luckily) it fit him perfectly. He spent a bit of time putting his little car together and running it all ove the house. Larry spent the day in his new pajamas, cashmere hat and scarf - he was very cute! We are still in the midst of a monopoly game...

I made a totally fabulous dinner - - chateaux briand with bearnaise sauce, creamy mashed potatoes, tiny peas in butter sauce, green bean casserole, raspberry razzle, rolls and a Buche d'Noel for dessert - perfection! (A cholestrol nightmare, but yummy!)

I have to go pick up my boyfriend from the airport - I dropped him off at 8:30 this morning so he could fly to detroit and back - he needed some miles for his Gold Elite status for next year! 

Evenings are way too quiet at my house - somebody needs to come and play!!! (specifically somebody who moved to Ohio and needs to learn some cooking tips - and you know who you are!)
