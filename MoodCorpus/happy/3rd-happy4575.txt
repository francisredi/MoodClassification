i was sooo excited for Christmas and it already came and went :( i'm sad lol but i had a super duper Christmas and i don't think it could have been better even if i had planned everything out myself. i got lots of nice gifts. i got a camera printer, some clothes, some underwear, purfume, and a really nice ring it's so beautiful and i love it! i spent most of the day here at home then went to visit my cousins which was fun and then my little cousin came over with ALL his new toys lol. i had fun cause i got to play with his gameboy hehe i used to love gameboys so i felt like a little kid again :) then of course christmas day always seems to get boring towards the end when all the gifts have been opened and "played" with and whatnot but my night was kinda exciting you could say. mike ended up stopping by my house. totally random visit and it was more good than bad. i love when i get surprise visits and the fact that it was mike kinda made it a little better lol.

tomorrow night i'm packing for north carolina. at first i was like blah i don't want to go but now i'm kinda more up for it. i found a lot of cool things we could do so it shouldn't be boring. i'm just excited that it's gonna be cold and possibly snowing yay! it's gonna be like in the 20s brrr but i'm so excited :) we're leaving on tuesday and coming back on monday so it's like 6 days which is not bad. then i get about a week back home again before i'm off to orlando again. i actually thought i was going to miss orlando a lot more than i did but honestly i had fun here at home and the time def went by really fast. it was time well spent though.

hope everyone had a very merry Christmas and i hope you all have a Happy New Year!!!! love you all!
