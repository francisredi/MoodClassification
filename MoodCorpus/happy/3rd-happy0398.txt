on thursday, me and gary got engaged!

it was so cute how asked me!

he took me to the nutcracker (and actually bought the tix...a first for him =oP) and then we went to the 'cheesecake factory' for dinner and we ate...and had dessert...and when they brought my boxed up leftover pasta from dinner, i was kind of like umm..ok i totally know this was supposed to happen today!! so like everytime he went into his pockets i was like "ok ths is it!" hehe so he gets his pen out and writes my name on one of the little boxes and writes 'will you marry me?" on the other! well i hadnt been paying attention and when i looked up he was on one knee with the box! it was so cute! i was like you know i will get up here!

he later told me why he waited so long...he wanted to do it right after the nutcracker but it was too crowdy and then at dinner he waited till after the table full of gaggling teen-agers next to us left :) plus, im sure he enjoyed my squirming! i think i was more nervous than he was!!

plus, the ring was his great grandmothers! It has a large round center stone (gary said it was 1/2 carat) and 3 smaall side stones on either side. its sooooooo sparkly!!!!

yay im so excited! we're shooting for april 2006 so i have to get right to work!!! though my plans are very simple, nothing too complicated or crazy!

sorry i didnt write earlier, i had to work yesterday and then to laundry.
