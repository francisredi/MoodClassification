you are a runner
went to the loretto thingy today, that was pretty cool. saw baunza, nick, ale, merc, emilio, sarah, and more. from there, nick decided to ditch me and dominique and amanda and go to some choir thingy instead of going with us to eat and to the park. anyways, we went to sam's, and it was the fullest i've ever seen it (granted i've only been there thrice). we listened to WOLF PARADE really loud and that was badass. we got some sort of chicken (great) and kung pao shrimp (delicious, but not enough shrimp) along with the obligatory iced tea, veggie rolls, and rice. we then went over to the little coffee place across the street, sat down, listened to some live music, and ate a giant cookie.

we went to madeline from there, which was pretty fun. the loretto swim team randomly showed up and stole our swing sets, which was crazy random. it was fun and we took lotsa cool/crazy/fun pics, but it got cold. so we went to scenic drive, which was fun. took more pics, glanced at the city below, and talked. it was really cool, but really freezing.

we then took off to drop them both off at home, and i took the longest, slowest route possible because we were having a really good conversation about sexuality, religion, people, and relationships. good times, i think. i have a service project tomorrow, and i hope somebody cool and not stupid is there or else i'll go crazy and shoot myself. or do the service project and complain about it later on my livejournal, whichever is easier (lol)
