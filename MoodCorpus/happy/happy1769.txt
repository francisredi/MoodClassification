Wow, I typed a lot.....
Went to the bowling alley with Burrito nd Meow, met with Supercool, then Candace showed up nd I was happy. Then we went inside to play pool, Candace went outside to wait for Jackie, then I went out there nd Ray nd Amanda showed up, then Skinny Paul showed up, he met everyone nd I thought it was cool, nd at somepoint, so did Jackie nd that Eric person I'm not too familiar with. Tyler showed, then after a game of pool we went to Starbucks, then some to Wendy's to see Jimmy nd Judie there. Went back to Starbuck's, then the $ store, then the alley again. We hung out there for the remainder of the time. The pool table kept crapping out on us. Then Kelly nd Edwards showed up, Kelly kissed Candace's cheek, telling her to pass it on, so I told her to pass it on to me so I can pass it on, so I got up nd ran to Paul, kissed his cheek, nd told him to pass it on, he Kissed Blackey, I nearly pissed myself laughing. I must say the highlight of today was seeing Candace nd Paul, my gorgous gf who I am totally in love with nd makes my life happier, nd my best friend whom without I cannot imagine living without nd is my biggest inspiration. I got home nd we now have a tree nd it smells good. My mom nd stepdad had bubblewrap so all 3 of us put it on the floor nd were jumping up nd down like a bunch of retards. Then I went in the attic nd got all the xmas shit out of the attic, which sucked 'cause it's like 2 feet shorter than I am, then they took the ladder nd left me there for 20 minutes while they vaccumed the rug in the bathroom (the attic door is in there) so I sat in the doorway with my legs hanging down trying to kick my stepdad who is too short to kick apparantly. Now I am on the pooter nd I'm supposed to type up my article summary, I'll get to it eventually. It for now, later.
