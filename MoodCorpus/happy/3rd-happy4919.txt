Christmas was alright.
I got the FMA pocketwatch! I got 2 pairs of pants, one are nerd pants, 5 shirts, one's Stewie saying the world is mine, a guiness shirt nd hoodie, a Pink Floyd shirt, nd 2 others with sayings. I got Office Space on dvd, Foo Fighters In Your Honor, Disturbed 10,000 fists, AC/DC hat. Then I got cologne, boxers, nd socks, that confuses me. Then I went to my uncle's nd got Harry Potter 2 + 3 on dvd, nd a calender from one aunt nd uncle. I also got a pack of Orbit gum wrapped inside a check for $150, which scares me, that's way too much money in my opinion, nd for my b-day a gift card to lord nd taylor's worth $100 from my rich uncle nd aunt. It was good. I gave my sister the Lucy doll nd she tackled me nd broke a light. We went to my uncle's house, I got lost, nd instead of my uncle dressing up as Santa like he does every year, my stepdad did it, nd I thought it was awesome 'cause it's been my uncle's tradition since I was a kid nd he wouldn't let just anyone do it nd it was just kinda special. 
Today I sold the card to my sister nd went to Hot Topic nd bought 3 pairs of pants nd earrings(I also had the $10 gift card to Hot Topic). I ran into Shawn Sploan(sp?) nd his gf, Rich Paulie nd Fasulo, nd Andrew Wiesi nd Ariel(Idk her last name), nd as I was leaving, Ashlie Slater. Later on I ran into Tom Vicious as I was leaving the mall. I didn't want new earrings, but my mom keeps complaining about the paperclip, nd would killed me if I didn't get new ones. The bag ripped as I was leaving the mall, but Idc 'cause I got new pants nd I haven't worn these kinds in a long, long, long time, like when I was in Brewster. I was debating going to buy $100 worth of manga, but pants are better, well for me, I miss them. 
Oh yea, one more thing:
I LOVE CANDACE!
ok, laterz
