Moving On UP....
So, my Sales Meeting at the boss' house went really well.  It was a great chance to just hang out with the Producers (salesmen) at our office and we had a good time. I got some rave reviews and so did Tammy on our marketing and it was reiterated how "appreciated" we are.  Then, of course, it couldn't be a get-together at LBs house without a drink or two. So, I had a beer with "the guys" since it was 12 guys and 3 women..what a ratio.  One thing I am going to have to get used to is the crudeness and sexual connotations beneath everything but I think I held my own for my first official meeting with everyone.  

I am so glad today is Friday. I am working till 2:30 then my weekend officially begins!! Yay!!  I think I'm gonna go the gym right after work, and then I'll head home and relax a bit before Jon and I go Christmas shopping tonight. I am pretty much done with my shopping except for one more thing to pick up, but he still has about 75% of his to do, so he figured that since I get WAY more excited about shopping, it might be good to take me along :)  

Then, my sister comes up tomorrow. She called me last night. It is still so odd to me that we are becoming "friends". I used to be the "big sister" that was idolized and then more of a mother figure right after my mom passed away and now with her being 16 1/2 and growing up so  fast, we are actually becoming friends.  although a part of me is still nervous that one of these days she will no longer find hanging out with me "cool" or enjoyable.  But I guess that is just silly. 

I am so glad to see her this weekend and I just really hope we have a lot of fun! :)
