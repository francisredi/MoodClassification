It's beginning to feel a lot like Christmas!
Been doing some mad Christmas shopping and baking these past few days. Yesterday, I went to the mall with my dad and he bought my mom a ring, perfume, and a new coat. Wow. dropped some change there. She'll love the ring, but she'll yell (mock-yell) at him for spending as much as he did. I got my mom, all my siblings, and Sue and Nellie done. I need something for my dad. He is difficult to shop for because he just kind of buys what he wants when he sees it for a decent price. You can't buy him a DVD beacuse if he liked the movie, he has the DVD already. He is difficult. I also need a gift for my cousin Jerry. He is also difficult. Oh shoot, and something for Joanna too! Just when you think you're almost done, you sure as hell are not. 

I baked cookies with my mom today. I make quite a mess of the kitchen when I attempt to bake. Is anyone surprised? Probably not. I also baked cookies with Bethany because we were bored. With all this baking, I have probably eaten my weight in cookies in the past few days. Oh well, when I get back to school, the Dulac walk will help me get back into shape. And, I'll have sneakers, so, Tiff, we are definitely hitting the gym. Or, talking about hitting the gym but not actually doing it. Either way.

Umm... yeah, so my sister's class is having a gift grab-bag kind of thing, and all the kids are bringing red and green candies and toys. Call me too politically correct, but I think this is unfair to the .2 Jewish kids that are on average in each Wethersfield classroom. So I was thinking of sending a Dredel in with her, just in case. Good idea, yes? 

OKaaayyyyyyyy, that was very jackass of me.

Good night!
