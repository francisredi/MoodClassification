Moving...
Well, we are moving all our shit today.  My entire bedroom suite (if you can call it that) is already gone as well as most of the kitchen and my parents bedroom.  

While clearing a path in the storage room, I found a dead mouse and I refuse to deal with it.  

Anyway, the real reason for this post is to say that now that I will be sleeping in the other house, it will be quite some time, I suspect, before I will really be able to be back online.  The internet is going in my room (Thank God!), but we have to wait for the phone to be hooked up and that will take a least a week and also Dad has to install the phone jacks.  Basically, we will be going without TV or internet for a bit.  

Thank goodness I taped all those Quantum Leaps yesterday.  

I also want to watch all the Christmas West Wing episodes.  And Leo episodes.  I was quite sad to learn yesterday that John Spencer, the actor who played Leo, passed away from a heart attack.  It's strange, but I think this is the most upset I've ever been over an actor's passing.  I just really loved that character and I agree with Mel that the show just won't be the same.  

Anyway, I guess that's all for now.  I'm quite excited about getting to sleep in the new house tonight!  I wish I could sleep right now though because I only got about four or five hours last night.  And I'm hungry.  I wonder if I can convince the Johns (brother and cousin who are moving us today) to let us get something to eat.  All the food's in the other house!  ;)

Love you all and I will miss you!
