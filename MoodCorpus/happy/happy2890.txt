Follow me...and i'll be..
Alright, another random title but okay, to start of my day, my brother goes off and gives me a call, waking me up, being me of course i was pissed of, and i was like "what do you want" he goes and tells me that my cat whet over to our neighbor's house and their dog started to fight my little hershey sadly and lucky my cat was  wining, how interesting was that, then afterwards my dad mostly like went over and got him, i wasn't there so i won't know lots of info.
Starting off my day with DA, i thought to myself that i should soon update more offten on Ygallery, since it was semi-dead, so updated one of my first porn drawings, it got pleanty of views for me to be happy.after i sent the picture of "Chris and Nico hugging" to chris himself, i started on my homework of course, me being a  bitchy person and lazy, didn't want to start it, sadly something just got over me, and i got half way done. 
After lunch we had to go to "Nex" it's a navy base store thingy, to go buy a tree, i was like "why are you bring me along?" so i went, we were picking out trees and found this tree called "Douglas" first thing that come up to my mind Circles! but that wasn't after i found out that it was a douglas tree when the picked it, going home i was like in my head saying "that tree is going to fall out of our truck, for some reason it didn't.
once we got home there were loads of work getting the tree in, up and ready, and up and ready to get all pretty looking, putting up the lights is a totally bitch, i mean it's like waste of time, maybe it's just me but, i think i wasn't in a good mood, i woke up with a headache and being sore, so i didn't feel like doing anything, NOTHING! of course my brothers came over, and i started being mean to them, not like mean as you would think of like hurting but i would slap them softly, then slap myself hard, yes i'm very werid, and i would say names like "What A loser" etc. etc.
Hearing an awsome news from my lover trevor, he doesn't wear glasses anymore well only if he wants to but he got contacts, personly i would think he looked hot with or without glasses, because his my lover and i don't mind it at all, in other words i'm so excited to go the th MAH( My american Heart) consert there the best ever in my life, and i'm going to see them next week.that's about today, till tomorrow =3
