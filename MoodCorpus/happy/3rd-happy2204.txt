don't know much about algebra!
I am finally done with linear algebra.  Forever.  I think it went ok, I fought the good fight.  Looking back though, I don't think it was as bad as I made it out to be.  Sure I was miserable, but there's something about the problem solving, manipulation of numbers, and exercise of a different part of your brain (other than straight memorization that I get in so many courses) that I like.  It sure beats biochem.  Ugh, I can't believe I'm singing algebra's praises.  gross.

I also got my grad photo proofs back.  Some of them are pretty ridiculous.  Like the ones where I have that ugly graduation hat on.  None of them are super nice (most of them are ok, but I have had more photogenic times) so I'm going to wait until my mom gets back and let her choose... because it's going on HER wall, not mine.

I cracked out my old yearbook and compared these babies to my highschool grad photos.  2 main differences besides the hair.  1) the teeth (duh), 2) the eyebrows.  I used to spend all this time to pluck mine but I had no clue about decent eyebrow shape.  Now I've gotten lazier but my eyebrows have gotten better thanks to the aestheticians in this world.  I'm glad I've learned something over the past 4 years.

My sis departs for the other side of the world soon.  I'm teaching her how to knit so she can do it on the plane.  What am I going to do without my mom and sis? (yeah I got it Steve- speak Chinese with my Dad)
