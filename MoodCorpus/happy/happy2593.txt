it even hurts to yawn
Agh, I think I'm going to do it again. No, not put my back out :p...I want to change my layout. I'm trying to decide what to do next, whether to stick with the Firefly theme (and moodtheme) or move into a Harry Potter layout with matching moodtheme (which I got this morning). *shrug* I dunno. Maybe I'll do something completely different. Depends on what image I decide to hack around with, but I do also have a fair bit of work to do today/this week.

For those curious, my back felt better yesterday afternoon, but sometime after hobbling around during Megan's candle party it got worse. Getting up this morning was NOT FUN. I also kind of jarred it when walking up the walk to work here, I slipped on some ice. Ouch.

Despite feeling pretty crappy physically, emotionally I feel good today. And that was even after I found my long-lost black spaghetti-strap tank top in my mailbox here at work. Gee, I wonder who shoved that in there? *COUGHCOUGH*DAN*COUGHHACK*?
And for those keeping score, last week EVERY SINGLE DAY there was a problem with the copier and I had to call the techs in. It was fixed once-and-for-all on Friday by some guy in a suit (I think he was the manager, called in since there was so many calls from me heh heh). Turned out one of the first people to work on it forgot to screw some bit back on and that caused a whole bunch of other parts to break. That made me pretty mad when I found that out... But, it seems to (finally!!!) be working again.

Today is payday-bills day. That means that I will see a sharp increase in my bank account, followed by a equally sharp decrease as I pay all the people that allow me to have somewhere to sleep, eat something, talk on the phone, have internet, etc etc...

Oh the joys of being a responsible adult! ;)
