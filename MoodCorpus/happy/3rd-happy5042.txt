Fun stuff
So yea I really love Christmas and I got lots of cool stuff. Sadly my mom ended up having to work Christmas day because the lady that was supposed to work was sick. But, she got home at 5 so we had Christmas dinner and then opened presents. I got Snow White on DVD. I was so ecstatic. Like ridiculously happy. Call me a nerd but I also got lots of good books that I will not detail because I will get called names but I am happy all the same. Also I got this huge 320 CD case holder so finally all my CDs can be in the same place. I alphabetized them for easy access. :). Also I got Converse.  

Today I went after-Christmas shopping at Lakeline. That was very fun up until about 3 and then the mall was nuts. There were people everywhere. We had to leave because it was claustrophibically full. I got lots of fun stuff there too. I just got some more clothes, slippers, and some Victoria's Secret perfume. 

I did absolutely nothing last week (like work wise). Now I get to do college apps this week. Joy. Also scholarship apps. Also English project.Also Ind. Studies work. Also sometime must go to San Antonio to see a neurologist. Tomorrow begins College essay day. I really want to read my books. But hey they are nonfiction so I can say it's for beefing up my app. :). Oh well. I'm going to enjoy the rest of my night and watch a movie with my sister. Hope everyone had a Merry Christmas and don't do anything dumb on New Year's Eve.
