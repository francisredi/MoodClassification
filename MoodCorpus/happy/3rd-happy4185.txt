Murrrry Xmas
Welp, Christmas wasn't as horrible as I had imagined it would be. Usually every year sucks cuz I'm in some slump over something but since I haven't been bothered by anything/anyone in a long ass time, it looks like my depressing mood swings are finally done for. I don't think I've ever gotten everything I wanted for Christmas, except this year.

First I'm going to start off with my dog. I swear to god this dog is like Tinker Bell and gets whatever his fluffy heart desires. He got like 12 new toys (all of which he unwrapped himself) a doggie buffet bar goodie bag (don't ask), and a couple new bones. Now all he needs is a king's size bed and people calling him Emperor Casey.

Now I got amazzzzzzzzing things. The L Word, Season 2 (my dad still doesn't know what it's about. haha.), a $40 thingy to bath&body works, a 2 year membership to Las Vegas Athletic Club (finally!), a Nordstrom Jacket, annnnnnnnnnnnd the title on the car I'm getting at the end of next month! woop woop! I looked at that membership information too and jesus christ, those things are expensive. For 2 years, only ONE person, $885. I'm so happy with The L Word tho. Now Karrrrrrren can come over and finally see what I've been ranting and raving about 24/7.

OH OH! And my new year resolution is to stop saying "fuck" so much. So if you hear me say "fuck", smack me. Thanx.
