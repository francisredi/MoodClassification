oh young blood young blood young blood!
omg, coolest present ever equals the cat woman book i got from nicky, aka my new bible, aka i'm living by it, yes! back to my gradeschool roots! prepare to be scratched, seriously! it's good to have the 'ol broad home, i missed her a lot, and we had some whacky fun details below...syke!  nicky, wanna have a sleep over tuesday night to wednesday??? that way we can go tobogganing and shit before i work at 4... at said time/work shift weird scandonavian unibrow guy who is apparently actually bosnian will most likely show up. did i mention that i saw him at zehrs after the work dinner and he stared me down? did i mention he's 30 and insane? oh. i did. well furthermore i'm excited for the break and also next semester! i'm soooo over this semester, i want to see some new faces! something i've never wanted before, weird, it's very exciting! plus i also like learning haha, i can name the hominines from the austrolopithecus AND homo branches, how exciting! can you? didn't think so! if you can shut up, it's totally not cool, so i hope you don't like, think you're cool or something....
anyways, i started my second job today, i thought i was hired to work in the deli but i was most evidently hired to entertain the wife of the guy who own's the place, who cannot speak english well by the way and kept referring to russian moof? lost me.

anyways, last exam tuesday, but i'm in the stage where i don't care, so i'm going for sushi monday! yay!  it'll make me feel healthy cuz i ate roughly half a pound of rainbow cookies and 563 chocolate orange slices. *pukes*

luv ya ;)
