For once, a good day.
Weee.  So our road trip is over now.  Back home again, dreading the prospect of returning to work tomorrow night.  Thank goodness I don't have to deal with the sign shop until Wednesday.  

My dad did the sweetest thing for me today.  During our trip home today, we pulled into a truck stop with a nice restaurant for lunch.  After returning from the buffet with a tremendous plate of food, I sat down in the booth and was sliding over to make room for dad, when my thumbnail caught on my jeans and *cringe* nearly got torn off.  Oh my god, did that shit hurt like hell.  I cried like a baby, and used my mom's glass of ice water to numb it.  That totally ruined my day.  Those of you who haven't experienced that kind of pain before &ndash; be thankful. 

So later we were going through a gift shop, and I found a gorgeous porcelain statue of a wolf pack on a rocky cliff, with a small clock set into the top of the rocks.  I fell in love with it, but didn't really have the money for it.  So I went on perusing the store, and before long, it was time to leave again.  When I went back to the motorhome bus, there on the counter sat that wolf clock.  Dad grinned and told me, "Here, this ought to make your aching finger feel better."  Heeee.  I love my daddy.

And Coco made me a random, unexpected table for my RP posts today.  That was so sweet of her.  I <3 me Coco-puff!  *snugs her to death*

I'm going to the pet store tomorrow to buy supplies for my new fishtank, and get some fishies too.  I'm probably just going to get a small goldfish or two, until I get the water chemistry balanced properly.  I've always been particularly fond of large fish, so I'll most likely end up keeping goldfish or koi in there and letting them grow HUGE.
