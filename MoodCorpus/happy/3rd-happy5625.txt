Christmas Day favorites
* Favorite part of the  big Christmas dinner of 2005: Eating take-out from Gold China.

* Favorite kitty moment: Playing Axis & Allies with Thomas when all of a sudden she comes tearing around the corner, jumps into the box, slides it across the tile at high velocity and starts batting around the dice in the box when it comes to a stop.

* Favorite driving moment: Slowing down when someone was tailing me on I-95 because they were making me nervous and having them flash their lights at me in return so that I found myself yelling out Jessica R.'s line of "Don't flash your flashers at me... ya flashhead!" before I realized what I was saying. Lol.

* Favorite gift: Hmmm... can't rank 'em. I got some pretty cool stuff. How about most unexpected gift instead: an iPod mini. (Pink, because pink is the color of girls. Hehe.)

* Favorite activity: Walking around the Chihuly exhibit at Fairchild. 

* Favorite mom moment: Going shopping and getting pedicures together. Cliche? Maybe... but not if you consider how much we both hate shopping.

* Favorite thing to anticipate in '06: Making fun of my sister for turning 30.

* Favorite Christmas moment: Getting lots of text messages from friends, being with my mom and brother, and other people-related joys like talking to Adam on the phone, getting a voicemail from my dad who's in Brazil and seeing lots of people I haven't seen in a long time at the Christmas Eve service.
