~Geez, that was crazy.
The games I got yesterday for the XBOX 360 were Perfect Dark Zero, Condemned, Madden, and I think a few others. I wanted Call of Duty 2, but my brother convinced my dad that we already had one for the PC. Damn, I wanted a 360 version. My God, the 360 is so awesome. I have to stop playing just to admire the beautiful graphics.

Last night, Adam and I took Joe out for sushi. Then we went to Cluck-U to get some fried chicken. I wanted the hottest thing they could give me, and I was disappointed. My friends thought it was spicy and almost threw up, but it was average to me. Then we went drag racing around the neighborhoods which isn't safe, but fun.

We went back to my house to pick up some things. I was going to take the 360 to Joes, but then my father stopped me from putting it in my backpack. My mother came down with what was going to be my birthday present. A carrying case for the XBOX, so I don't have to lug the thing my by old backpack all the time. Once at Joe's place, we just fooled around. Played some 360 games, and then played a 99 stock match of Super Smash Bros 64. That took freaken 2 hours to finally complete and I lost. I was Pikachu, Joe was Samus, Adam was Mario, and we just randomly stuck Ness in there. Damn, Pikachu. Then we played the game Condemned and holy crap that's spooky. It's almost like Doom 3, Silent Hill, Resident Evil, and maybe Max Payne all put together. Fianlly, we finished off the night by watching my new dvd series of Family Guy.
