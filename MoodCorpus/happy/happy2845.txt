i heart eggnog
so i'm just sitting here, eating mini marshmellows hoping they'll fill the void in my body where food should be.
i just got back from mark's house. 
we went to the Detroit Film Theater and saw Kill, a "killer" (hehehe) samurai movie.
before that i was at wayne state for 2 whole hours waiting to speak with an admissions counselor. 
somehow they fucked things up (again) and my name didn't get called. 
anyway, i'm a wayne state student now and i can't wait to start classes!
i saw angela today for a bit. that was nice. i miss her and robyn and all my other tavern people i hardly see anymore (but them especially because they're not at the tavern anymore).
so i still haven't gone christmas shopping yet. 
i have my gift for one person so far. 
good thing i made a list of what to get people or i'd be screwed.
hopefully i'll go shopping this wednesday.
i got really sick this weekend.
i was going to call off work at the tavern but i was hosting and with all of karen's issues towards meaghan i highly doubt that she would believe i was actually sick. so i went eventhough i felt like i was about to pass out any second.
i called off work today though at westborn. and i plan on calling off tomorrow as well since my grandma's taking me to get a massage. and with everything i did today and only nachos in me i feel like shit. so i don't mind not working. except my check is going to suck.
can't wait till christmas. i'll be spending both days with mark :)
the fam is really eager to meet him. this is gonna be great!
