Nandos
Went out for Chris' birthday saturday night. Caught the bus with Hayley, met Eddie on the way and accidently met up with Chris and his girlfriend. Got to town at 8, met up with everyone, and walked up to Nandos. Got theere only to be told we'd have to wait 45 minutes for a table. So trek across town to bowling where there's an arcade. Sophie thrashed me at air hockey hehe. We also found Ben's twin on a dancemat. It was scary, he could dance faster than I could see the arrows! Was also identicle to Ben. We tried taking a picture, but none of out phone's were good enough, and I didn't want to get out the camera. 

Half an hour later we're walking back up to Nando's, when a chav throws an orange at Sophie! We wanted to leave the evening alive, so just carried on walking (a bit faster) up the road. When we got there, it was about another 10 minutes before we sat down. Got out food. Spicey! Me and Hayley both had "plain" burgers, and we still had to drink lots! Yay for bottomless drinks.

Was funny when Eddie was trying to explain what a certain fruit was (I forget the name. Had "apple" in it I think), but when he was getting nowhere Laura said "so it's like a toffee apple but with out the toffee or the apple?" What is a toffe apple without any toffee or an apple? I was laughing about it for ages lol

Got taken home by Eddie's dad. Holy cow those two can have sarcastic conversations! Didn't get home till about 11:30, and I'd not meant to stay out late because I was still knackered from Friday night! Fun times
