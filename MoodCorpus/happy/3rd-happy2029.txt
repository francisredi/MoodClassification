wow still rushed lol. 
I just got back from playing some DDR with  Ok, now I admit I haven't played this game a whole lot but they were like AMAZING! It reminded me of frickin riverdance. Anyway I had much fun and I think meeting random people from the internet is like wayyyyy more comfrotable when you have no expectations (aka don't meet anyone of the opposite gender alone lol.) Um, now I want to make a list of things I learned over the last, lets say, week...


- I am not the best DDR player
- DDR is really fun
- I really don't trust anyone to cut my hair right, but at the same time don't really care about haircuts 
- "Grey" describes alot of things
- In the new season of stargate the ghoauld's are kinda crap. And it makes me sad. There is nothing more sad than a supervillan with no redicilious power for themselves.
- When you play DDR don't stand in the middle tile. Just keep your feet where they land and look for the next arrow.
- I could be less shy, but than I would have to kill something I really like about myself
- I keep tring to kill my shyness but its impossable.
- Homemade pretzels can only be a certin maximum size before problems arise.
- Drugs actually should not be legal. Well maybe just legal for me:P Most people are to retarded to handle them. Even Freud.
- I can't be the master of everything, but I can chill with masters of many diffrent arts and learn alot still. 
- I might not be the best artist overall, but I can do amazing stuff with a blob of wax in my hands to play with semi-unconsiously 
- I need to go out more and be social
- I don't know many fun places to go and I hate people
- I like cinimonn on french toast
