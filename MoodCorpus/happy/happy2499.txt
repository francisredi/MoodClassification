the captain always takes one for the team
&nbsp; At one particular meet, they had donughts in the main office.&nbsp; Im not sure exactly who they were for but im guessing they were for the coaches.&nbsp; But we found them so we decided than rather seeing them go to waste, we should take some for ourselves and for the other g3 members.&nbsp; The box contained a dozen or so donughts, so we thought that whoevers they were wouldnt notice for our five of them gone.&nbsp; We left content, munching on donughts with a few for our compadres.&nbsp; I was nearing the end of my donught when I heard the assistant coach approach the group leader and ask him "where'd you get the doughnuts"?&nbsp; With almost no hesitation he quickly replied "oh just over in that hut yonder" (not a direct quote but close enough)&nbsp; I looked over at jp as he crammed the remainder of his doughnut into his mouth.&nbsp; I quickly wiped the remainder fo the powdered sugar from my shirt and tried to look as innocent as possible.&nbsp; I did not want the effort of our captain to keep us out of trouble to be in vain.&nbsp; Fortunateley, we were not caught and jp only suffered minor injuries for inhaling his food. ( im seriously just kidding but it was fun to see him scarf that donught) but yeah, the point of the story is that we have an awesome team captain!
