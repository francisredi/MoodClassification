Hey Everyone!
I'm so excited about having my own web page now. I heard this is a great way to make friends. I can't wait to get to know some of you. Well I should start off by telling you about me. My name is Chelsea. I'm a sophmore. I like to write poetry and read and watch TV and listen to music. I have a boyfriend. We've been going out for almost three months. It will be three months on the 20th. He's supposed to come over today. We are exchanging Christmas presents I think. But I don't want his cuz he bought me something expensive and I hate it when people spend a lot on me. Unless it's my parents. Then it's okay. Or my best friend Heather cuz she'll spend whatever she wants on me. Anyways, last night I was playing a game on Yahoo and this gut starts talking to me on a private instant message things. He asked me to describe what I look like. I told him my height, weight, eye and hair color. Then he was like "2 more things" I didn't know what he was talking about. He was like "things girls have that guys don't" I was like you don't need to know that. And then somehow he got my screen name and started talking to me on Yahoo instant messenger. It was weird. I almost didn't wanna come online because I was afraid he was gonna start talking to me again but I've been on for a while and he hasn't yet. But he's probably still asleep. But I'm telling you he was weird. Well, I g2g. ttyl Buh-bye.
