Over the Weekend Update

Friday- Baby sat the Millers over at my house, while my mom, dad, and heather all went Christmas Shopping. Made 20 dollars. 
Saturday- Was our Christmas Party over at my house, with friends and family. Here my mom invited Zach, having it be a surprise, (going and opening up the door and here he is!). Had Christmas Dinner, opened presents!! "FUN I TELL YA!" I got an American Eagle Gift card and bath &amp; body works stuff from the millers. And from Zachary I got a 12K White Gold necklace and earrings!! once i got it all unwrapped and i saw the 2 big white boxes, i started to get nerveus wondering what could be in them. My mom said "Heather is jewerly!!" I opened them up and I got the bigest smile on my face ever! I gave him the biggest hug after that. And Zach opened up his gifts from me, (good thing I got them that morning when I went to the mall.) I got him the Avenged SevenFold Cd, and AncherMan (spelling??!)&nbsp;I also got the Avenged SevenFold cd when I got it for him too. No one left till after 1am. I went to bed and I was out. 
Sunday- I went over to Tawnie's house and we cooked up some spanish food, along with Kayleigh and Katlynn. LOL good times, I tell ya. Once we were waiting for our one drink to sit for 2 hours, we all got out our cell phones and started playing ring tones and dancing and taking pic. on the cell phones. Then we played The one new Twister game with the music. Thats a lot of fun. lol I think I may go out and buy it here soon. Good party game I tell ya, 'n sooo much fun. 
Well that was my weekend. I hope everyone elses was fun also. "comment"
