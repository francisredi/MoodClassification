Sunday....
yesterday finished up the shopping with Robbie. "search and destroy" method. we did well, we only spent a hundred bucks between us, but this time i spent more than he did, it's usually the other way around. stopped to see Troy at work and wasted 3 bucks on lottery tickets, as is our Saturday ritual. went to Dillard's and R bought three fancy shirts. ate lunch at El Charro, i have so been in the mood for Mexican lately. came home and had a teeeeerrrrrible thing happen. Troy got me new nipple barbells. i decided just to change the round dealies, accidentally pulled the bar out, and couldn't get it back in. eek, ouch, eek. so i had to go see that piercer friend of ours, he fixed me right up, but i was embarrassed. oh, well, better embarrassed than to have them grow up, lol. went home after the nipple incident and dyed my hair, put the hightlights in, and it turned out crappy. so i'm redoing it again, as we speak.

this morning i was getting ready to go out to my folks' to exchange Christmas presents with them since i have to work all next weekend, and of course work called. i ended up going in and working 2p-6p. mama and daddy liked their presents, at least it seemed like they did. they gave me money, which is always nice. they also gave me my birthday presents "in case you want to exchange them." they did really well, i got a new pair of jeans, a black sweater with a matching scarf, and a neat pair of flair-legged brown cords. 

, , , and : you all have packages in the mail! i mananged to get to the PO right after it opened on Saturday and missed the crowds! Robert drove by shortly after on his way to pick me up, and he said you couldn't get near the place!

well, "time to rinse"!!! talk to you later, my lovelies!

Peace,
