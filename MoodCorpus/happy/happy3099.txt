T-123 days and counting...
I just dropped $320 on the TicketMaster website.  It feels good to spend that much money on something this special.

The Phantom of the Opera is such an amazing production that the good seats have already started selling out for performances over a hundred days away.  And the advertising just started yesterday.  I acquired 4 seats in Balcony 1 Center (and having seen the show 6 times in seats ranging from the very back to the front row, these seats are what we consider to be the best).  I spoke with  on the phone, and he's hoping he'll be able to make it for the April 15th show.  If he can't, my mom will help my sister unload the fourth ticket.

Yesterday afternoon, Susan and I were discussing what we wanted to give each other for Christmas.  We had agreed to spend no more than $100 each.  Neither of us could really think of anything that we wanted.  Then, about an hour later, the Phantom commercial came on, and suddenly knew exactly what we wanted for Christmas.

So now we have tickets to see our 7th performance of The Phantom.  It will be our 7th show in 5 cities, including New York.  Up to now, we have traveled 6,472 miles from our home to the cities in which we've seen show.  

Now, assuming I resist the urge to buy tickets for another performance, we have 123 days of anticipation leading up to the opening curtain.
