Abu Dhabi and Oman
Hello All!!!

Today was a fabulous day!!! My mother, grandmother, the dog, and I went to Oman today! We saw some villages, went off roading, visited some sand dunes, and saw the sites along the road. It was a rather exciting day. The part of Oman we were in did not require Visas and Passports. 

My favorite part was the sand dunes; Duba (the dog) and I ran up and down them and chases eachother byt the time we left he and I were covered in sand. It was quite a site. 

Tonight we are going to relax and play cards as a family and maybe watch a movie. 

Christmas was good!! We ate a lot of good food and we all opened our stacks of gifts. I got the game Risk, which I am excited to learn how to play. I think I am going to get my brother to teach me and then when I see Melanie I am going to ask her to play and try to beat her. I hear the game is a lot of strategy. 

I havea lot of cool picks I took today! My favoirte one was with the camel! We saw some camels and stopped to see them. I love camels; they are my new favorite animal. Sorry Duba; I still love you. 

I am ready for the spring semester, it should be an interesting one. I am taking Chem 110, Abnormal Psych, Experimental Social Psych, and a Communication and Composition class with one of my fav profs Dr. Guelcher. 

I misss everyone lots!!
Hope everyone had a safe and happy holiday!!!

Bye for now,

Tamara
