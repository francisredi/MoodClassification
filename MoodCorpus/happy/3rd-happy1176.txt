+x*...Circle moshing...*x+
Helloo..

So I went to fowlers last night. I went to the X-Mas mosh. It was quite fun. Tami and I got the o-Bahn into town and met up with Tom and Sean, where we proceded to enter fowlers, where it was $15 entry O.O. Sean told us it was 6?! Ahh well we got in and watched Red Shore for a while, until the Jonestown Synidicate (sp?) Came on and we watched them. They had this massive circle going where people were moshing and punching and kicking and running in circles and flipping and stuff. Its like the metal equivelant of a break dancing circle lol. We really only came to see through closed eyes, and they were last, so we watched wish for wings, which were really good, and then went upstairs to sit on lounges and wait until TCE started.
I saw some girls from carclew there..
The we watched TCE, which was an exprience. Lol, people were jumping on eachothers heads to sing in the mic and yeah the crowd went off for them.
