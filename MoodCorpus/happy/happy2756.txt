The worst has past
So I have my last easy final on Wednesday but I am basically done. It feels good. :) I just need to remember to clean and to do laundry before I leave. I'm visiting Maria on Thursday (or maybe Wednesday night) and heading home soon after. I bought for myself a North Face backpack from eBay which will hopefully be coming through. Brea is coming home from France in a few days and I cannot WAIT to see her! :D I want to hear about all of her experiences in person, especially her skydiving and it'd be nice to catch up with her about the past semester. I also have a whole list of people I want to see, they all know who they are hopefully. lol :) I've finished most of my Christmas shopping except for the immediate family (Mom, Dad, Phu). I'm pretty proud of how I kept under budget but it makes it easier when I don't have a boyfriend to spend money on. That's a pro and con in itself. I am making plans to visit Nova for the last few days of my break and in the meantime, spend time with my parents and just relax. Three weeks of break is all I have but I kind of like it like that. 

I think that eBay gets more and more dangerous every time I look through it. I want so many things but I should be conservative with my money. Nothing else is new with me besides that. I just want to say that I miss Brea and I can't wait to go home and be with my family. I can finally say that going home, I won't be thinking of only one person who's there but the others who will be there that care about me. Yay.
