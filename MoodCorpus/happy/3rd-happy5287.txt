My Christmas was...
I had a pretty darn good Christmas this year.  I got some things that I was expecting and some other things that I was not expecting to get at all.  I got a jewlery armoir...which is really really beautiful.  It goes along with all of the other new furniture I am getting.  My dad has already built me an amazing bed and is going to be building me a desk and a gentleman's closet.  My room is gonna look so great and I am going to have a really good start when I move to my own place.  And me getting my own place soon was the theme of this year's gift giving.  They got me Christmas ornaments to use on my own tree, ornament storage thingys, and they are giving me our current artificial tree because they are going to get a new one!  They also got me kitchen stuff like really good measuring cups and a really good spice holder that is magnetic so i can stick it to my fridge and have easy access to it.  I also got some really pretty matching jewlery, a necklace and bracelet that have blue roses on them...HOTT!  I got a sexy orange hat too...can't wait to wear that around campus!  They also gave me some sewing stuff and sewing projects to do over break.  YAY!  But the best had to be the Law and Order Season Three DVD.  I LOVE THAT THING! It is actually sitting in my headboard right now.  I watched one episode today and I loved it.  Watching them without commercials makes them so much better.  

Oh! And they gave me a space heater! So I will be nice and warm in MY OWN ROOM next semester when the heat decides to not work! I love it! I am so happy! And I have a nice warm blanket that Steph made me so I will definately be plenty warm! YAY!
