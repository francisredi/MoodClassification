My Day
Today i woke up at 8:30. I listened to music on my headphones and then I had breakfast. I had Banana Nut Crunch. Then I listened to music on my headphones again and then took my shower. I was supposed to call Kevin and Myra at 10:10. I called and Kevin said come on down. When I got there, Tiff was getting Baby Austin ready cause he was going to the party also. She was also getting herself ready. Me and the kids colored a picture for Lauren. I colored her a Teletubbies picture. We left around 11:15 for the party. It was at Liberty Park right here in Parkland. The kids had so much fun and so did baby Austin. Big Austin wasn't there. He was at a Miami Dolphins game. Lauren was so happy to see me so was Shane. When the party was over, i went back to Kev and My's. I went to a consignment shop called Kiss a Kid with Tiff and My. I got Lauren a small Barney stuffed animal that sings some of the "I love you" song. I got Shane and Austin stuffed animals also. Then we stopped at Chuck's Steakhouse in Fort Lauderdale so that My could get a gift certificate for her mom and dad whose anniversary is the day after x-mas! Then we stopped at a Quik Shop and I got a Red Bull drink. Then we went back to the house. We went out to dinner to Denny's in Deerfield Beach. I treated everyone to dinner! Tiff starts her new job tomorrow at the air conditioning place. She will be the only one working in that building. well that was my day, i will write again tomorrow! bye!
