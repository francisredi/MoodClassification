"I was gonna say 'Johnny' but he busted out with the 'Panchito,' sooo..."
So I turned 19 years old on Thursday and I feel really old! When I hit 20 it's gonna be so WHOA.

I had a ton of work to do on Thursday night so I didn't go out with friends, but my mom was down here for business so I had a nice dinner with her. Tonight me, Bruce, Ashkon, Charlie, Nima and Jeff went to El Torito in Beverly Hills. Highlights:

- Within moments of sitting down, the waiter comes up and asks "Margaritas?" Being the alchy I am, you KNOW I tapped one, but at $6.50 a pop I clearly didn't drink enough to get drunk. It was still cool, haha.
- "C'mon, flash me the peace sign" "Nope, that's only for the cameras" haha, I'm such a fucking asshat
- "What is this fucking pancake burrito?"
- Charlie telling us the LONG story of him getting caught drunk and belligerent at the USC game, and how he basically lied his ass off to get out of serious punishment, only to discover the guy in the booth next to us (and within earshot) looked A LOT like one of the UCLA deans... whooooops

Those bitches told the waiters it was my birthday so we got some hottie flan. They paid for me too and I felt so loved, haha. Afterward, we went our seperate ways (Ashkon drove Bruce and I) and we decided to go cruise Sunset Blvd. It was pretty happenin' but there wasn't really anything for us to do (no fake IDs). Cyrus and his fam happened to be down here really close to where we were, and we scooped him up to hang out but his dad told him he couldn't go to Westwood with us... bummer. Bruce and I ended up at Starbucks (as usual) and kicked it there for awhile.

Overall, it was nice. It was awesome to be away from campus for awhile, because it made me realize how much I DO like LA when I'm not at school. Ugggh, finals are going to kick my ass and I'm just ready to be HOOOOOOOOOOOOME with all of my folks.
