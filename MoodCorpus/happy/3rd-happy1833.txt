The Wrong Kind of Preparation
I'm going through a serious strawberry pop tart thing. If I could, I'd eat them all day long.

Because I don't have to study, write papers, clean, or pack I've decided to make a Christmas mix to listen to on the way home. (Note: "don't" means "absolutely must") I feel like it's probably the best mix ever made. By me. In the past week or two. It's a little Sufjan/B+S heavy, but I've got albums of their junk (and what fab junk it is!)

Belle and Sebastian - O Come, O Come, Emmanuel (Advent comes first, guys!)
Ron Sexsmith - Maybe This Christmas
The Fall - Jingle Bell Rock
Bright Eyes - Blue Christmas
Sufjan Stevens - I Saw Three Ships
Belle and Sebastian - Santa Claus, Go Straight to the Ghetto
The Walkmen - Christmas Party
Blur - The Wassailing Song
Sufjan Stevens - Only At Christmas Time 
Ryan Adams - Hey Parker, It's Christmas
The Fall - Hark! The Herald Angels Sing
Sufjan Stevens - Silent Night
Okkervil River - Listening To Otis Redding At Home During Christmas (makes me cry)
Madness - Inanity Over Christmas (makes me giggle)
The Waitresses - Christmas Wrapping (this almost didn't make the cut...I still don't know if it belongs)
The Polyphonic Spree - Little Drummer Boy
Sufjan Stevens - Lo, How a Rose E're Blooming
Belle and Sebastian - The Twelve Days of Christmas (best sound effects, period.)
Dismemberment Plan - The Ice of Boston (New Year's matters, too!)
