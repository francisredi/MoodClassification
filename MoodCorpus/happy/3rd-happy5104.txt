Merry Christmas
I know it's a bit late to say "Merry Christmas," but I didn't say it yet, so "Merry Christmas!"

I had an awesome Christmas. I got some really cool gifts that you all may enjoy. I got a label maker (I've made use of that already), a Game Boy Advance SP (the advanced version of it with rechargable battery and all), a Bible (one recommended by my youth minister), a dartboard with "pop" shooter, a mini-optical mouse, and to come along with that mouse: a re-built computer! My new computer has a 20 GB hard drive, and 128 MB of RAM, woo-hoo! I love it! However, so does my mom. She spends time on my computer, too. Sheesh! I can't explain why she's on my computer as well, but she can explain it. So, ask her.

I've made some changes to my LiveJournal, as you probably may notice. I made the changes just today, so I hope it's good enough. I'm still wanting to change my icon, and I'll be creating that pretty soon.

I have been trying to get through to Nikki, but I realized I've been trying to get through to her a bit too much. As recommended by my mind and my perfectly-talented mother, I shall lay her off, and try to get through to her, hopefully by New Year's. I have her Christmas gift still, ready to give to her. But, we will still need to figure it all out. As the situation changes, I will let you all know.

Also, I'm getting prepared for next semester. I have Web Site Design (my career plan, as I've mentioned plenty of times), English III (I told you I wasn't so hot last time), Desktop Publishing (now with Adobe Photoshop), and Oracle Programming (full year course now going into database programming). I will have my folders labeled and ready to go, and they'll be labeled with the use of my new label maker. Man, it's awesome.

Well, I gotta get going. Once again, Merry Christmas, and I hope you all have had a good one. God bless, and I'll talk to you all later.
