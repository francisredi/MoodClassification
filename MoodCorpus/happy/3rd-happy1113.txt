Cookies!
Today I made some holiday cookies.  The sugar cookies that are already cut into shapes and the break and beak chocolate chip cookies.  I remember why I never do homemade sugar cookies.  They are like crack!  You crave more and more!  I ate one and a half and then a chocolate chip cookie..I just had to try one of them you know.  I felt kinda ill from the sugar..but otherwise okay.

My grandma loved them.  It is kinda cold and rainy here now.  We had pizza hut pizza for dinner. Yay!  I now have yummy pizza I can eat for lunch for the next few days. Yum!  It was fun doing the sugar cookies, but I did not ice them with the icing that came with them.  I don't like it..tastes too yucky. Ick.  There was leftover cookie dough so I just pressed the left over bits together, used a small glass to cut round circles and a pretty snowflake and sun cookie press to press a pretty design into the cookie.  

It is easier to press them when they are on the cookie sheet otherwise they would never come off right.  The cookes are just how I like them, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and a very pale shade of brown.  Using an airbake cookie sheet is cool.  Then I will never burn the cookies.  The cookies made about two small batches of cookies each and are very tasty.

And to all the cell phone users who are behind the wheel.  HANG UP AND DRIVE YOU BASTARDS!! WATCH WHERE YOU ARE GOING!!  Or please, pull over and park if you have you use your oh, so important, cell phone.  The rest of us are tired of getting nearly run over, ran into and into accidents because you aren't giving your full attention to your driving.  I wish they would make it a law, no cell phones while driving.  How anyone can afford one is beyond me.  Even the pay as you go phones cost more than they say for the right to keep the phone 'active' and to first ativate it.  What a rip-off.  Someone is getting rich from cell phones.
