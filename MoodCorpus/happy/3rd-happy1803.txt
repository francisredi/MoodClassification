YAY
This week I finally was able to get my new car, the 2006 Scion Tc!! Its fucking hot!! So far the past couple of weeks have been pretty cool, finals are over and I have been able to relax a whole lot more.  I went out and got christmas gifts this weekend and for some reason I end up getting even more things for myself when I try to shop for others.  Oh well its all good though.  Last night me Terrell, Jonathon, James, and Keith went to Jeremy's christmas party which was ..eh ok, but we then went to Talbot where it got much better.  Today im gonna go shopping with my girl Julie and then go on a date with Jerome.  Hopefully. 

SO yea, about Jerome....Recently I have been kinda putting guys to the side seeing as how I think they are assholes. My friend Ryan decided to hook me and Jerome up. At first, I wasnt gonna go for it but seeing as how Ryan knows both of us pretty well and thought we would match well, I decided to give it a go.  After talking to Jerome the whole week, He seems like an awesome guy. Literally, everything I want in a guy and more.  Jerome is incredibly gorgeous, and I wonder if he would like me when i meet him. I mean, im cute too, but he is fucking beautiful. He used to work at Abercrombie in IU and the girls loved the hell out of him (guys too :-)). Im alittle nervous but we'll see!!! TELL YA ABOUT IT TONIGHT!!!
