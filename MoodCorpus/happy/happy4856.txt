Brief Update
I haven't done a real update in a while, and this one's not gonna chage that.  But, I thought you'd like to know what's up with me since I haven't been on much the past week.

Revels practice was going on all week.  Combined with work it meant I had zero free time.  Yesterday I took a little time off work since Wednesday they had gotten my car towed (they paid to get it out yesterday) and I felt the need to de-stress.  I filled this time by spending it with .  That made it all the better because I was around a good friend.  Plus, I had Chipotle, which makes everything better.  Yesterday evening was our open dress rehearsal.  This means there were people there even though it was still technically a rehearsal.  It went great.  I'm so excited about doing it again tonight.  Afterward, we went out and tried to go to Friday's to celebrate a fellow Reveler's birthday, but they closed early due to "inclement weather."  Not a flake had fallen yet.  But, Froggy Bottom was still open and took us in and had Sam Adams Winter Lager on tap.  Yum.  I don't usually like beer, but this one is good.  Especially on tap.  Then 's & my ride got locked in the parking garage and we had to go through a whole rigamaroll to get it out.  So I'm running on like 3 hours of sleep but I feel good!  And I repeat I'm SO excited about tonight.

If you don't have them yet, you should get your tickets for Revels.
