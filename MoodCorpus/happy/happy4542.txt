but in your closet, there's some crazy shit
I went to see Dane Cook perform at University of Maryland on Tuesday night.  He was hilarious.  Definitely my favorite comedian.  If you've never heard him, I highly recommend giving him a listen! His website has audio clips.  

It's snowing!

Note to self: Dulles Toll Road toll booths do not accept Canadian coins.

Other coin news:  All semester I picked up any coin I saw, was given coins by other people, and I would empty my coin purse into some cups periodically.  I came home and my mom had been saving all the coins she found for me, and my collection of change at home was getting pretty heavy.  So I bring this huge bag of like 20 pounds of change to the bank, pour it in a machine and I had $72.37.  IN COINS!  So exciting.  Of course that is why I only had Canadian coins left, because the coin machine didn't accept them.  Oh well.

I am learning to knit and I am really getting the hang of it!  It makes me happy :)  Wes is getting a homemade scarf!

So much shopping left to do.

Last night I went to Ned Devines in Herndon to see Lloyd Dobler Effect play.  It was fun, and I hadn't heard a lot of their new stuff.  I love those guys.  I also got to see Donnie's (the drummer) son Cole yesterday (not at the bar, clearly)... he is absolutely adorable.  Anyway, so at the show last night some unidentified guy bought a round of drinks for the whole bar.  How awesome!  Thanks random man!
