She makes the driver blush...
So Sunday I left good ol' b-lo for good ol' fredROCK. I will be gracing the MD kids with my presence until January 13th. lol So Monday night me and Matthew headed to downtown Frederick to check out the lovely Christmas lights, which was pretty much lovely. Then we headed over to Starbucks for some free beverages and good company. Rice Cake was working, Brett, Mikey, Chris, George and Hailey were there. It was a good time. Apparently Starbucks has become the latest "hot spot" in Frederick, and I've developed a rather bad addiction to Chai tea. I like that I know two starbucks employeees, they can be the key to my Chai Tea fix. hehe It's really good seeing Matthew again. I thought things were going to be weird but surprisngly they aren't. I'm so very lucky and greatful that we have remained such close friends. He's an amazing person. :) 

So I miss Mr. Shawn Stoyle, I'm listening to Elliott and everytime I do that it reminds me of him. It reminds me of one of the first times that he came and hung out, i think it was the night that it took us until 5 am to say goodnight, we were listenin to elliott in his car. it was cute. This month is going to be a challenge but I think it'll fly by. I miss the roomies too!!! Soooo I think as soon as we all get back from break there needs to be a movie night. Me, Shawn, Christa, Katie, a mattress on the floor and a Gary Busey film. lol<36%
