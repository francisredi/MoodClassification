Christmas Eve!!
OMG! It's Christmas Eve!!!!! But it hardly feels like it at all! I mean, the weather outside?!? It's SUNNY! And there isn't a single cloud in the sky! It's chilly yes, but still it just looks completely the opposite of how it should look around Christmas. I've took some pictures of the sky, but I haven't yet put them on the computor. I'll do it later so you can see them. It looks just so wrong! 

Racheal called me earlier on if I wanted to go to town with her again. Unfortunatly I couldn't 'cause i've got a heck of a busy day today. A little while later, Sam came round asking if I wanted to pick out a rabbit. She only lives round the corner and it wouldn't take that long so I decided to go with. Her bunnies have gotten ALOT bigger since I last saw them! I could hardly believe they were the same ones XD! They were still dead cute though =3. I held two of the six bunnies (I daren't touch more than that since I'm still fighting off this bloody cold XP). The first one had one sticky up ear and one lop ear. It look really funny X3. The second one kept looking at me so I picked him up. He seemed to be the biggest of the lot and, of course, I chose that one XD. 
I obviously couldn't take it then so Vicky (Sam's dad's girlfriend) put a little jumper on it to tell which one it was. Actually it was more like a purple and grren sock with a few holes in it XD. But it passed off as a jumper anyways. It didn't seem to happy about wearing it, but he was alright after a while. Whether he's still wearing it now or not remains to be seen mind XD. 

I've just finished cleaning out ALL my rabbits hutches out all ready for Christmas. It took ages, but I got them done in the end =). 
My next job is to wrap the last of the presants which needs doing. I like wrappy presants =3. I dunno why, I guess it's just that "Santa" feel, y'know X3? 

Woo! Can't wait till the big day =D!!! I'm so excited ^______^!!!
