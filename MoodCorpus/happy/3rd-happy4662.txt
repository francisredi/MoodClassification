Is it morning?
it is but I have to confess I am not dressed yet! I woke about 9 and have had a lovely long lie in with Poppy drinking mocha and sketching out an idea for a faery and tor painting. Lunch soon, then I am going to light candles and burn yule oil to create a festive feel.  is coming round later for some festive nibbles and Christmas cake. 

I will write out a proper list of thank yous later on but... thank you so much to everyone who sent such lovely lovely gifts. I was overwhelmed. I am going to sort out everything properly later on and will be going round the house with hammer and nails hanging new things on the walls. My faery altar has some new additions so I am going to re-arrange that properly later on and also leave one of my faery chocolates for them. 

I had a lovely Christmas day over with Anne and Geoff and Howard and Graham, their sons. Howard made delicious mulled wine so we all had a glass of that, and had a traditional dinner of turkey with all the trimmings and ice cream fruit cheesecake for dessert. Then we opened our presents with the tree lights on. Laura and Guiseppe, friends of Annes who I also know well now (Guiseppe works in IT for the University so I know him from work as well) came in and we had coffee and nibbles and a lovely chat. Then we managed some salad for tea. I got home about 9 last night and I slept for about 10 hours- maybe more! I have started to listen to music on my walkman as I am falling asleep again because I am still just a tiny bit nervous, and that helps. I am definately saving for an iPod now though. I think that would be ideal as they are so compact and I could get all my favourite CD's on that as well.

Have a lovely Boxing day everyone and some proper individual thank you's to come later.
