weird noises coming from the end of a quiet room
WEaiting for 4pm. That's when we were told we could leave. Everyone else in the office left hours ago. I stayed to keep Tracy company. I got her a copy of Eddie Izzard's "Dress to Kill" for christmas. I think EVERYONE should watch Dress To Kill. It's hilarious. Eddie Izzard is so my betrothed. I'm going to get famous and chase him down the street. He'll be in heels so it'll be an easy chase. Even though i am a crap runner.  

We were drinking Chandon & Moet for lunch and Tracy thinks i'm still going on it but i swapped mine for apple cider ages ago. She must think i'm wasted. 

Oh my god i have been so busy organising gigs and working and buying presents for my friends and trying to see everyone i haven't been able to see. It's all too hard and i love it!

I HAVE TEN DAYS OFF WORK!!! Drink/sleep/walk/play/lounge/love

Which reminds me, we are recording our demo soon. We have four gigs lined up ~{including one at the Ding Dong Lounge in March with DOLL SQUAD}~ and it's so hard promoting without a computer. It's hard doing anything without a computer. But at least we impressed the band booker we wanted to impress and he asked us back and i manaed to get josh's band a gig too. The booker doesn;t know we're an item, i think it will be easier to keep it "Don't ask/dont tell" at this point because i wouldn't want people to think they have to do me a favour for Sister Anxiety every time the Dead Record Girls get a gig, or vice versa. 

Everything rocks right now. Except Violet the Satanic Cat. ~{HaTe THe BiTCH!}~

I am going to be so sad when Shannon goes to Canada.
