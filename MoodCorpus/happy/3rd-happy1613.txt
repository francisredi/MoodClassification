Changes Coming!
I haven't written in this journal for forever. We have a major life changing event happening. We're moving to Minnesota. It's all happened so fast. J got a call the week before we left to go to MN for Thanksgiving. He told them he would be there then and if a interview could be set up during that time, that he could do that. Well, he interviewed on Friday, Tuesday they offered him the job for more than he had asked for! Our house sold to the first person who looked at it, J's getting a voluntary separation bonus! I'm so excited! It feels like a big opportunity for a do-over! Family do-over, husband do-over, house do-over, friends do-over! I'm really tired of this town and the huge Mormon influence on the community. I keep saying I don't care, but I do. I am excited to be in a more diverse community. We found a house we like and will be seeing it next Monday. The boys are handling it pretty well. I can tell that K is concerned. He doesn't deal well with change so we will have to take it slow with him. I'm sure there will be more than one tearful day for him. My biggest concern is their school. I hope that it's at least as good, hopefully better, and that they can make friends quickly. J's last day is the 10th so we will have him around for about a week and a half before he starts the new job. Everyone there is being very supportive and I hope that we can grow into becoming a big family. I want to start journaling everyday so I have this as a memory book.

Today: We celebrated Christmas with the boys today. It didn't really feel like Christmas..kind of like a big birthday party. Next year I want to go all out. Decorate everything, Christmas music, Christmas party...all of it! 

Resolution #1(added daily until I get to 30)- Finish painting interior rooms that I want to change.
