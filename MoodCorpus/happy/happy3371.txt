its an update
Hi

I cannot believe it has been almost 6 months since my last posting.Well now it has been almost 3 weeks since i have moved into my house. It has been really cool to finally has bve my own place. Work has been fine. I just hate my shift and I'm hoping in about 3 more weeks I will get a much earlier shift and everything will be better about the first week of January 06.

Just placed membership at Memorial Road Church of Christ and am very excited about the opportunities to serve and grow there. i love the class im in. Everyone is awesome and i want to get involved as much as possible. I love the church so much! A shout out to my friends in Weatherford, OK.Good luck wih finals. The real world is gonna be great I gaurantee it.  On a side note i am wanto to go skiing again since i have a leg of steel now and  will not be broken again i say. I will endure. 

I am going to do my shopping tomorrow and get it over with. i hate to shop but i only have about 2 weeks left so i need get on it. I may just do it online. Also I got cable today and its been a hit. I love my friends and i would do anthign for them. I admire them because they have great hearts. I have done stupid things and said some dumb stuff t them. May they pray for me as I pray for them. Who am I? Just a crazy random guy who loves Jesus Christ. God bless.
