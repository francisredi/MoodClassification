the stables is my happiest place on earth
I got a D on the physics test. I have never had a class where I've repeatedly gotten Ds and Fs. It's really depressing. At least we are all failing together... not that that's a good thing, but I don't feel like a total failure.

I got all my gibbons homework done! YES! So I can zone out in front of the TV tonight. Woot woot. Oh and I saw Winston today :D I went to the stables after school to help out with the therapeudic riding center. I lead lined Mandy. I like her, she is really nice and you can actually hold a semi intelligent conversation with her. I got out Bart for her and he was "wild" (actually he just spooked at another horse) so I got to trot him around. He was dead calm of course, but I got to ride so I was happy. Tried to make him canter because Loretta said I should get the spunk out of him (lol what spunk?) but he was really lazy. REALLY lazy. I think I got a total of 2 strides out of him and about 5 laps of really fast trotting. Ah well. After I finished, they gave me Christmas presents :) They are so sweet. And I didn't have to help with that Robert kid, so I was very happy/relieved. The poor new girl Sarah had to side walk with him. I feel bad for her. Anyways, I gave Winston a bunch of baby carrots and he really like them. I threw a carrot at Petey. He's stupid. He didn't see it. I can't wait until Sunday when I will probably (and hopefully- crossing my fingers) get to ride Winston. I love that big teddy bear horse.
