Christmas Day
Merry Christmas to all my Christian friends!

 Christmas morning was its usual hectic self. My mom was stressed, my dad was more hindering than helpful. Everybody got up later than they wanted to and by the time my brother came up from his house, Steph and Jay from Norwichtown and my godmother from across the driveway, it was 10 o'clock before we opened gifts. Fortunately, it only took us about an hour and a half to open gifts. My parents bought each one of their children an expensive gift, plus some smaller ones. My brother got a massage chair, Tara got a television, Steph got game table and I got a digital camera. We have got great parents! As a matter of fact, I got a lot of great gifts: DVDS, CDS, stuff for my collections, some bottles of hoilday cheer! 
 Christmas dinner consisted of a spiral ham, peas, asparagus, candied yams, and baked beans. We toasted the holiday with cranberry wine. For dessert, we had my mom's buche de Noel, a french pastry in the shape of a yule log, cream puffs, pumpkin cream cheese pie, cherry cream cheese pie, apple pie, Reese's peanut butter cheesecake, gingerbread cookies and macaroons that my brother Josh made. Steph's boyfriend told his parents that he won't have holiday meals with his side of the family anymore because Steph's family cooks better, especially the desserts.
 Adam and I will exhcange gifts later on tonight. I'll spend some time with his family and hopefully, we'll get some special time together. That is all I really want for Christmas from him.
