"every door i shut was leading me to you"
he shaved. oh my god, i can't tell you how much this makes me squee. i absolutely adore his face, and that beard, just wasn't working for him. i can't even tell you how much i love val and seeing him in concert. this is the second show i've been to in three weeks, and there's another one next month that i'm dying to go to. anyone local who wants to come, let me know. 

i asked if he remembered my name, but he didn't. alas, i will pester him again until he does. he knows , so maybe i should just associate myself with her. besides, i shouldn't expect too much. thousands of fans are hard to know. met this girl jen at tonight's show, she was working the door at the goldhawk show i went to on the 30th. totally drunk, but that's cool. i swear we were the only two people that actually moved during the show. everyone was like standing still and i think that the majority of the people there had never heard him.

he played a weird country-ballad version of the patient patient, and i can't decide if i liked it or hated it. cool thing was this is the first show i've been to that i've seen him actually play with a band. all the shows i've been to have been him acoustic, which is cool and more coffee house atmosphere, but it was awesome to actually hear shock the way it was recorded, and to get that real rock feel.

he played the decadent decline too, which i really like. & absolutely still which is just a great song all together. it's on my myspace right now, over shock (which was the hardest choice i had to make). i just can't get enough of him.
