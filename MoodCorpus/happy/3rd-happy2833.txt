Miss Marple Vs Time with friends.
This week is going to be a great run up to the Christmas weekend, I'm going to be quite busy seeing people which'll be nice considering I usually spend so much of my time alone. Today I am visiting  for coffee, a chat and a look at all the new toys he has added to his collection since I last saw him, Thursday I am hoping my brother will pop down for lunch with my Dad and I, Friday daytime will no doubt be spent wrapping presents and taking care of any last minute buys for Christmas but in the evening Kathy, who I've mentioned before has said she may well be popping over for a pre yuletide visit if she is not too tired (it's a bit of a drive from Horsham and she will have been at work all day). Saturday of course is Christmas Eve and so I shall be off to 's place for dinner and pressie swapping and then on the day itself my Dad and I will be driving up to my Brother's for more pressie swapping and a turkey feast. Sadly though there will be no Christmas day tv as he refuses to keep a set in the house :(

So, the next few days should be good huh? I feel quite lucky, it's not that I wasn't looking forward to sitting alone watching the episodes of Miss Marple that are on tv every day until Christmas, it's just that there is little substitute for the company of friends (and besides, we have a VCR). Yes indeedy.
