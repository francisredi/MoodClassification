second round interview
I am in the second round interview and I am happy about it.  Yes I have great potential.
It's amazing that a month back, I never dreamt of being a manager in the near term. Thinking makes such a big difference. I am greatfull to Ina for encouraging me to take this posistion. 

Today using mindmap, I wrote the list of things that can be asked for the interview. Mindmap is a great way. Yesterday I had been to  toastmaster area level conference. It was quite useful. For the first time, I used mindmapping for taking notes. It's very useful and now I beleive and plan to use it, make part of what I do.  I am excited about the way things are going in the last 6 months. I need to bring the god given potential and use for the my and the greater good. 

I am prepared well for the interview and I stand a good chance of passing it. I was surprised that Judy rated me high than other candidates. It's a good indicator of my potential. In my career, I always put my heart in whatever I do and now it is paying.  I will look for big goals. One way to bring the best in me is to stretch myself and see my limits. It is like doing the exercise, to build muscle should stretch my current limits. Just doing what I had done before doesn't take me too far. 

That's it for now.  No.. I have some more to write. I completed reading, "life with no Anger".  It is my comittment that in the next six months, I will reduce my anger by 60%. Reducing anger is not just about expressing the anger, it also about not feeling the anger. I will use what I learnt from the book.  I will start using the anger journal to track how I am doing on my anger.
