Tis the Season
Woke up, bugged Garrett for a while. Then got ready and watched a little Season 1 of Nip/Tuck. Ah I love that show so much, Christian = mega hottie <3. When Garrett got back from taking Dani to Sergio's I went to Doc's to get my back adjusted, it's nice to go up there. Everyone is so nice and I talk and talk, it's like another family of mine. Doc gave me some tickets to watch the Generals, who wants to go with me? I think it's like for whatever game but I'm not too sure!! After that I went to pick up Lia face and we went shopping!! I <3 shopping, I got 2 shirts from AE HALF OFF!! and curtain calls + I got Rach's christmas presnt weee. After the mall was fun, right Lia?? lol lol..that damn bitch.

Then I came home and took Dani to her friend's house. I thought Jenna was already there but she wasn't :( so I didn't get to see her but I talked to her. Apparently the guy from Elk Rapids does remember me go figure? hehe. On my way home Rach called me sooo I went to BR w/ her then to my aunt's house. 

Now it's time to read by the fire, I wish I had a bean bag. Tomorrow should be fun, cleaning cleaning cleaning + Suzi is gonna be here around 12 YAYNESS!! sooo I'll probably spend a few hours or there sledding and what not :) :) :)

2 more days until I get my 17inch flatscreen monitor, my outfit from Express, and whatever else my mom forgot to tell me about SWEET!
