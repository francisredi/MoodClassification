GoooOOOooOOoooOOOOoD Morning!!!
I am entirely too chipper for this time of the morning, but what the hey it's the last time for like a month that I have to get up at 6:45 WHOOHOO!!! Well that is unless my darling little brother decieds that he wants to wake me up that early on Christmas morning. LoL. It's gonna be so weird that Noel won't be there this year...hum...Yeah
Anywho, called Dunkel last night and we talked for forever! it was great I loved it! Well we had an actual conversation for the like the first 45 minutes we talked and then just tried kicking each other's asses at Bejeweled the rest of the time. It was most fun I tell you. ^.^
Yes so today is thursday and this my last day of these particular classes *yay* So that's what I have to keep telling myself all day lol. Hum dittly um... Oh yeah Nicole made me this kick ass collage thingy, it's so nifty I think when I go home this weekened I"m gonna buy a frame and put it in it. Well la te da, there is nothing new here really except maybe that new foot of snow we got the other night. GEe, the snow pile is almost up to my window, Cassie and I were taking bets to see how long it would be before we just couldn't see out our window anymore without having to stand on a chair. Most humorous I tell you. Alrighties, well I'm done, and I'm gonna to finish getting ready for class so I'll talk to yins l8ters,
