MUFFFIINNNSSSS~~ XD
YESH! I baked them yesterday~~~ Do you know I really REALLY love Nigella Lawson?? My elder sister bought a book called "How to be a Domestic Goddess" which was written by her, and she have absolutely interesting yet fabulous recipes~! By the way, if you don't know who is she, she's one celebrity cook host~ 

Anyways, I decided to bake 2 of her muffin recipes yesterday~ AND it is simply EASY to do!! I mean, there's no need for folding, no need to cream the butter and the sugar first like all cake prep. IT IS SOOO EASY!! I started at 2pm, finished everything by 530pm~ And I did a total of 24 muffins, 12 for each recipe~


The first muffin type I did was this fabulous Snickers and Peanut Butter Muffin. Yes, thats right, such unique recipe right?? the prep is kinda sticky, but at the end of it, when my muffins are out from the oven, WHEEE!!! Delicious looking muffins~ And they TASTED great!!



The second recipe is even EASIER~ and is vegetarian too, because there's no egg or milk in it~. BANANA MUFFINS~ I think some people don't like banana muffins, me for instance, but I'm doing it to try out and for my parents to taste it as well. Turns out it tasted very chewy (very Q in Singaporean terms) and I think I added alittle too much Cinnamon powder, because the cinnamon aroma is so over the top~! ahah...



And thats the combine picture of my muffins~~ heheeh



I think I'm going to bake this more often, and for our West side Pot luck as well~~ hee..Giving some to my groupmates today and my friends in my religious centre later~~
