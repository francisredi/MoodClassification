"Will you wait for me while I get a Chinese massage?"
I got up at 8:30 and went to the Mall/Publix with Mom and Kate. Kate and I had a good time laughing about weird clothes and her dry socket from having her wisdom teeth removed. After getting a sweater and stuff I rushed home to see if Dad would take me surfing, but there were 28 knt winds which would totally blow the waves out. So I practiced violin and went over to Brendan's with Gordon hoping to finish Zach's present, but the technical difficulties were well beyond our reach. So in the meantime, we listened to midi files. After that I met Zach downtown and he gave me my awesome Christmas present which included: a custom designed shirt, dark chocolate, some Chinese vanilla things, and a nice card. We ate at Juarez and then went to Leopold's. Who eats icecream and milkshakes on Boxing Day besides us, I do not know.

There's this jacket I'd been really wanting for over a month now from Gap, and while we were at the mall I put it on hold. I was gonna bring my mom back tomorrow to get it, but Brendan bought it for me. That really made me happy because I used to wear this green jacket that was a hand-me-down EVERYWHERE when I was 3 till I was like 6, and I finally got another one. 

Gordon and I got free Chinese massages. He was the one who went back and paid for a 10-minute session.
