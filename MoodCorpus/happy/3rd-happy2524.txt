Party Recap
Thanks to all who attended my party this Saturday I had a great time.&nbsp; For those of you who were not there you should be jealous.&nbsp; The details were a little fuzzy for me because I was wasted.&nbsp; Jill made me a beer bong so I had to test it out.&nbsp; I did it like a champ, but when I tried to do 2 beers I almost threw up, of course this was only an hour into the party.&nbsp; That would have been bad news.&nbsp; Jill and I remain undefeated at blacklight beer pong and Cos was&nbsp; a hero for all males everywhere when he bested Jill and Diane after they eliminated our whole team.&nbsp; WAY TO GO COS!!&nbsp; Pole dancing by Keith, Cos and myself set the tone for midway point of the party, which was followed by me elbow dropping Cos and at some point a bunch of people were on my bed.&nbsp; Steve Z did his first beer bong, so did a girl from Target.&nbsp; People were starting to leave so I passed out on the couch upstairs to Ryan and Steve Z jamming out while a guy from my work tried to make out with my girlfriend.&nbsp; No one from work knows we are dating so I can't be upset about it.&nbsp; Jill woke me up and took me to bed.&nbsp; Cleanup the next day was not so bad, not too much spilled beer.&nbsp; Another awesome party for the books.&nbsp; Thanks everyone for making 24 the best birthday ever.

P.S.&nbsp; Our show on Thursday might be canceled, I can't get a hold of Charlie to find out, which sucks because I would make plans otherwise.&nbsp; Getting seriously pissed off about it.
