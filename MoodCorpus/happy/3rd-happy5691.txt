A Nice Neighbor
Mid-December, I placed an order with a small manga publisher. I never heard anything from them, not even a confirmation email of my order.  (That could easily be AOL's fault though.  AOL is sometimes overly aggressive about blocking perceived spam.)  Last night, I decided I would email the publisher today to ask about the order.

Before I could write the email this morning, we got a phone call from a neighbor down the street.  Turns out he had a book delivered to him.  Since he was expecting a late Christmas package, he opened it without looking closely at the Send To address.  Imagine his surprise when he discovered a manga inside.

In good neighbor style, he looked up my phone number and gave me a call to let me know he had my book.  Hubby walked down and picked it up for me.  (Sweet hubby)

I'm amused by the timing of the whole incident.  I was within a half-hour of firing off that email to the publisher when the phone call came.  The very nice neighbor saved everyone a lot of trouble by contacting us.

Oh, and the wrong delivery was definitely the postal carrier's fault.  All the address labels were correct.  The carrier just misread the house number.  S/he delivered it to house number 7 instead of 17.

Hubby and I are wondering just what went through the neighbor's mind when he discovered the manga inside.  I bet he was surprised and puzzled.  LOL
