Whee!
So, yesterday was better than I dared imagine. I showed up for work in a skirt for once (gasp!) and after work I met up with my closest girls for a drink (or two) in downtown Reykjavik and we had a good chat :) 
Even got pressies! A beautiful top from Caroline, a nicely scented bubble bath from Linda and a DVD from Heidi....

Yes, ladies and gentlebeings, Priscilla is back! XD 

I lent my dvd to Heidi last summer, and only got the case back :( She promised if she could not find it that she would do her best to replace my loss. You have *no idea* how much I've missed watching this movie! And the version she got me (prolly had to scour through most of London to find it!) has extras and stuff the other one didn't, so I'm a happy gal! :D

But really, just getting to meet my friends, getting good wishes and stuff from everyone and even getting presents! ( I never get presents on my b-day) all factored in making this the best birthday in a loong time! My b-days are usually a pretty sorry affair due to the Xmas rush and all, so I was very pleased, even though it may not seem like much to most people. 

Thanks guys! *hugggs!*

Oh, and isn't Iceland the colest place to hang out right now..? 
Quentin Tarantino loves it so much, he's coming back here for new years, and now Kiefer Sutherland is making a return from his new years stint here last year, appearing on talk shows and whatnot. WTF?
