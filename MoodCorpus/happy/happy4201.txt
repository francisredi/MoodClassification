It's beginning to look a lot like...
Hooray, we finally decorated our tree!

It's been sitting in the living room for over a week now, I think.  I got the lights put on it a while back, and then we kept getting busy, so we didn't get the ornaments on it for the longest time.  Still, we went about it properly:  Today was really snowy, but in the soft-and-pretty rather than life-threatening way, and we put on lots of Christmas music, and we had hot cocoa.

This year we got to have a bigger tree than usual, thanks to our replacement of our love seat with 2 chairs.  Instead of just having the 3' top of our tree, we got to use a whole 6 feet this time - which meant we got to revisit a lot of ornaments!  Two in particular deserve special mention... Ric's mom had kept any number of odd, kitschy Christmas ornaments during her life, and Ric has two that epitomize her "tastes".  One is a little plastic candy cane which was allegedly part of a set once upon a time.  It's cheaply made, beginning to fall apart, and it's blue.  Completely silly, but it made us smile to remember her.  The other is an ornament I have dubbed "Scary Pajama Santa".  This one is a little moulded plastic Santa with red velveteen fuzz for his suit and a somewhat creepy kewpie-doll face, and is probably forty-some-odd years old.  Both ornaments are, I'm sorry to say, tacky beyond belief.  Therefore, they hold places of honor on our tree. :-)

Aside from that, we've got a little decoration in our kitchen window and a large faux pine garland over one wall in the living room.  That's about all the Christmas we can fit in our living space.
