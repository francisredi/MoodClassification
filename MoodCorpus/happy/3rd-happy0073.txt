Texas Tornadoes
As I wrote on my Women's Fiction with Attitude blog, we're enjoying a very eclectic Christmas. Besides listening to Moroccan music while writing our Christmas cards, we got a new Texas Tornadoes CD - Live from 1990. Ah, was there better music? Between the music, the food, the intelligent high-tech community, and the affordable real-estate market, we may find ourselves living in Austin next year.

Life is just too short to deprive myself from access to live music on a regular basis. So, it's gotta be either Las Vegas or Austin. Thumbs down to Vegas, I think. Living in a tourist area full-time gets to be a bit too much. And we've learned it's also important to have access to a better-fitting professional community. There are not a lot of appropriate jobs for me here in Florida. When I started down this path to fiction author, my intent was to continue taking short-term technical writing projects. It worked for awhile - until we moved to Florida. At first, it seemed it was just part of the nation-wide high-tech slump. But high-tech has revived in the traditional places so Austin should be a better choice long-term. I'm looking forward to a new adventure. And I can't wait to be immersed in an eclectic collection of musical talent: Texas Tornadoes, Willie Nelson, Radney Foster. If I had to choose, I think the Texas sound, with all of its variety, is my favorite. It's tough for me to choose a favorite of anything, especially when it comes to music because I love it all, but the Texas sound - whether Country, Tejano, Mariachi, etc. - is pretty darn high on my list.
