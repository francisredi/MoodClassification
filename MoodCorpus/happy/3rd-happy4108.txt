MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!!
MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!!!! Last night was our party, we had my grandparents and my uncle  come over and we ate lol. We had maccaroni and broccoli salad and shrimp and really good bread. It was a really good Christmas eve and my grandparents really seemed to like their presents. I got a really really nice makeup set from my mom, I got the Chicago DVD, Eleven On Top, the Mariah Carey CD, a bunch of candy, and some gift certificates to the mall. I can't wait to go on a shopping spree! Tomorrow they have all these great post-Christmas sales going on, and I could really use some new clothes. I'm listening to the Mariah CD right now and it's really good. So guess what I'm doing today? Going to see The Producers! haha. I've like never seen a movie on Christmas, so it will be like really odd, but who cares, I want to be different. I'm going with my parents. And then after that we're going to eat some Chinese food or try to find a restaurant that's opened lol. It'll be so awesome, and I really want to see The Producers. I'm so tired. I was up last night watching a James Bond movie with my mom and uncle, and then we watched The Iron Chef. Well, it's time for me to get ready to go to the movies. Merry Christmas everyone!!!! xoxo con mucho amore...Laur
