A not so Silent Night
The last Ten Tenors concert of this year is over and I'm all happy as always when I listened to those ten australian guys. Their concerts are always an experience. And the next concerts I'm attending are already clear, June 1st and 2nd next year. They'll be back in Hannover then. I'm also thinking to attend the concert on the 31st of May but that day is also the last one of our final exams and we still don't know when the last exam on that day will be written. Should it be sometime in the morning we could make it for the concert in the evening but we'll have to wait and see. I'm willing to sit in the very last row if necessary. Maybe I can tag mum along with me for at least one concert. She seemed quite enchanted by the guys today. Or better to say, yesterday since it's past midnight already. Speaking of the guys, aside from autographs and lovely smiles I received a nice comment by Liam.

Liam: Hello. How are you?
Mikomi: Very fine, thanks.
Liam: *points at the shirt I'm wearing*
Liam: That's a nice label.
Mikomi: Oh, thank you.

The label of that particular Esprit shirt looks really nice, I never thought a guy would actually notice that. I didn't get to ask Katrin if she understood what Liam said to her today. Her English is worser than my mum's and most of the time it's either me to answer for her (in line she's usually behind me) or she doesn't say anything at all. That can be quite funny sometimes.
