WELLL Hello there.
Haha haha ahhhhhhh okay no. Really, this morning was interesting for reasons I'm not going to list, but then this afternoon around lunchtime Chris and I had music going and we were playing kung foo fighting kitty vs weasel (yeah we do that when ritchie and maria aren't here. HAHA! Just kidding, but we were doing it today out of randomness sake) anyway as I'm having icarus kick the weasle in the head with his mighty cat powers the door opens and there's Serian and I'm like "OHMYGOD!" And totally dropped icarus on the weasle. That was funny. Anyway, YAY! my sister's done with school for the christmas break thing, whatever it's called, she finished her classes yesterday and drove down here to watch the show! Yaaay! I'm all excited and happy! She even picked up ritchie from the school and we all ended up going out to lunch, that was exciting, I forced maria to go with us. Haha. Aww it's so great having her come all the way down here to vist, I like that, I'd like it more if she came to russia but eh. Haha Chris and I aren't getting a momments peice with visitors though! Jezz. It's crazy. I wanted my mum to come see the show and Serian told me she was comming down later today. That's exciting, neither my mom nor my sister have seen any of the stuff I've been in for about 4 1/2 years now. Ah well, ritchie likes them, that makes me happy. But yeah. Cool stuff. I have a headache though and Serian and chris are talking about me *sulks*
