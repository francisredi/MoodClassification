Very lovely day....
Yesterday mom and I went to "Oklahoma", the musical, last night! It started at 7:30pm and ended at 10:30pm. Heck, that's longer than a movie! Very fun though! When mom and I got there we saw that almost everyone was dressed in evening wear...mom and I were in jeans. Probably one of the very few times I haven't dressed up. But I held my head high and glared back at anyone who glared at me. I am preppy you know, so I can handle stuck-up people. Most of them were elderly anyhow and I expect them to dislike me...they usually do. I don't know why, but most rich old people don't like me, which is unusual because most adults like me (except one, but I won't go into that). Well, anyway, the musical was awesome, though the lead female character was wearing pants, which was completely wrong as the year this was set in would NEVER have allowed her to wear pants! Besides she looked *much* better in a dress (which she eventually changed into).

You know what I noticed? I see more older men checking me out than I do guys my age. Which I actually prefer because I don't like many guys my age, except Sawyer who's nice to me. Plus, I talk to adults better than I do my peers or little kids (which could be the same thing as most of the people my age, that I've observed, act like little kids).

You know what my absolute favorite orchestra is? "Trans-Siberian Orchestra"! Seriously, you guys need to check it out, especially their CD called, "The Lost Christmas Eve".

I still have a slight cold which means I can't sing, which seriously sucks! I LOVE SINGING! I had a dream last night that I had gotten better and I was singing opera and it was sooooo pretty!

Ok, I'm going for now. Write more laters!!!
