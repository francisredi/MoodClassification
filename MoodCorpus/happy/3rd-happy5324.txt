christmas
well the fun time of christmas has come and gone, what did happen this weekend was lots of fun. friday a little around noon i went alton to pick up lola from the train station. we went to lunch then stayed around here watching tv till we went out to dinner at night with the crew plus my sister and her husband. then we headed to dereks house and played muchkin while the girls plus kyle watched blade trinity. saturday we spent alot of the day here, then we had to go to walmart to spend money on my mom, spent more time with lola and watched serenity, and other movies, all night, then sunday, we went to church she met more people then we came home watched Dukes of Hazard, that was an ok movie, we did not get to finish untill after christmas presents were opened. we opened presents around 1 in the afternoon. i got just about every present that i liked cept one, hmm lola probably would be thinking it was the shirt she got me, but its not that shirt is actually pretty funny. the one gift i did not like was the fact i got star wars clone wars instead of something else. but i did get Firefly, Serenity, X-Men 1.5, a black tshirt that says "Will Work For Anime", The Dark Tower Book VI and VII, lots of chocolate, a red dress shirt, jeans, some more useful items, also got a necklace with a dragon on it, and a DVD burner, also got two gift cards, one to walmart and one to Blockbuster. then we watched firefly and X-Men, and i spent alot of the night fighting sinuses. today was a rough day though, we spent time togethor, though i feel bad for lots of things, she came in my room early to spend more time with me and i fell back asleep, then we watched more Firefly, then when it was time for her to catch the train we took her back the other thing i regret she knows about and only she will know that. sorry i am not posting that here.
