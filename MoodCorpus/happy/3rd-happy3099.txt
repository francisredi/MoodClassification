Two more shopping days until Xmas...
Well, it's three days until Christmas.  We have Nick and Brandi visiting this week, so it's going to be a busy weekend.  I'm off tomorrow through Monday.

We have finished fixing the bathroom, finally.  A new paint job and new electrical and switches and it is almost restored to pre-fire condition.  All that still suffers is the bathtub.  We're not going to replace that, so I will do my best to clean it when I have the time.

Karen is supposed to be getting a trailer in a couple weeks, supposing she finds a place to put it.  Permanent trailer sites are pretty hard to find since the storm.  Most of them are being used for FEMA travel trailers.

Tune in to href="http://www.kicker108.com" Kicker 108 to listen to Pascagoula High School's Impact Show Choir's re-writing of Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer, Downtown Got Run Over by Katrina.  It is amazing to hear such talent from such !  They have sold out of their CD of the song by now.  Quite a fundraiser, huh?

John, Nick, and Brandi are out galavanting about the coast shooting video for a production Nick has in mind.  They visited Hancock County, and we all went out to lunch, since I was working.  I think they managed to get lost in Pearlington, but that is all too easy these days.  All the landmarks are gone.

I have finished loading and updating the machine I am currently working on, so I will logout for the day.

'Til next time...
