movies and shopping
so, i'm ALMOST done christmas shopping, all that's left is tom's father, and to wait for tom's mom's gift to arrive in the mail. still dunno what i'm doing about his father tho, i found something yesterday that would be good but i dunno if tom wants to do a joint gift or what.

met up with garianne yesterday and we shopped around (she got some of her christmas gifts done) and saw the Chronicles of Narnia which was really good. the effects were amazing. i loved the part when the fawn is playing the lullaby for Lucy and she looks into the fire and the fire turns into fawn-like shapes dancing, it was really pretty. but yea, i had fun :) and they showed the preview for the new Pirates of the Carribean movie (looks funny) and i wanna see some new Heath Ledger movie that i have yet to figure out what it's completely about called Casanova.

but yea, it was a good night. this weekend was fun, went shopping with tom, worked alot, had a final yesterday which i'm so glad is over with. i have my presentation today, final on friday and two papers to write and possibly a third for extra credit if i have the time. busy busy busy! this weekend is gonna be fun, have yet to completely decide what we're doing, but we have plans, lol, haha. i'm off saturday so yay :)

ok, well, i'm gonna go and do a few last minute touch ups on my project, byes!
