Funniest moment in BCW history
Since I received an overwhelming response from current and former BCW superstars, I figured I would continue with the questions here at the Sweet Spot for this update.  The responses to the best bump question were great, and hopefully these answers will be just as good.  So the question is...what is the funniest moment in BCW history?  This can be anything, a quote or a spot, whatever you think it may be.  Think about it for a minute.

For me, the funniest moment that I have ever seen in the BCW is when Hog did the elbow off the roof and then Homes broke out the worst robot in history, now known as the Homesbot.  When I saw Hoggy D jump off the roof and land on the ground, it was one of the craziest things that I have, or ever will see I'm sure.  I moved and then I heard Hog let out the "OH FUCK" but it had a weird sound to it, and I remember asking Homes if he was alright and Homer said I don't know.  So then I turned around to see Hog curled up into a ball holding his side.  I don't really know why, but it was pretty damn funny to see him laying there, still being able to move after doing that spot.  Then when Homer walked over to pin him, I was cracking up but when I saw Homes breakout that Homesbot, it was the funniest damn thing I had ever seen since it was so fucking terrible.  I have never laughed that hard during a match, as I am usually able to keep my laughs in, but this one I couldn't hold back.  After watching that sick ass bump, and Hog laying there hurting to the Homesbot, it doesn't get any funnier for me.  Hopefully everyone else will have something different to say, but if not, tell me your version of the story and why you think it is the funniest moment in the history of the Dub.  For now peace out.
