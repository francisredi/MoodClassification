Beautiful.
There are moments when I stop and think. And I realise that life is beautiful. Appreciating Literary Works is so utterly different from what I have expected. At first, I found it a chore to be attending lessons and every Monday, after 4 hours, I will come out of class literally drained.
But at the last lesson, I found beauty in this class despite recent cynicism from certain people. I guess I am a really quiet person. I can be really crazy and noisy, but most of the time I am really quiet. My teachers from sec sch all the way to poly says that I am so quiet, I hardly utter a word in class. Hehe. I guess that is true. 
And you know what? I am very happy with myself and I never love myself more than now.
ALW made me realise that there are no definite shapes in society. Having&nbsp;an influx of thoughts may not necessarily be a bad thing. I know now that whenever I am thinking too much, I will put my thoughts into words in my notebook. =] I wrote my heart out for the last essay, I don't know how did I do. But I loved and will always cherish that experience I had.
Thank you Mr D. You made a difference in my life. I went into ALW not knowing what to expect because I know that the literary face of this earth is something that is not possibly comprehensible by the human mind. You taught to expand and bounce on my ideas. You gave me the idea that nothing is wrong as long as someone understands...
Questions are not bothersome. They are beginnings of things perhaps wonderful. Now, tell me why I love art.

I love art. and finally, I am loving mass comm. I will neevr forget the amazing experience I have had in ALW. and i hope to continue writing, till the day I die.
