It's Snowing!
I can't believe it, we actually have snow two days after Christmas!&nbsp; I was only chatting with Annie the other day and she asked me if it was going to snow on Christmas Day and I said 'nah, it never snows at Christmas now'!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, we made the most of it by going for a walk this afternoon with friends (from church)&nbsp;to Rufford Country Park (about half an hours drive away from where I live).&nbsp; There were 17 of us (6 kids and 11 adults) and apart from my dad and step-mum who are both in their 70s we all had a great time throwing snowballs etc etc.&nbsp; After we got back to church we all had hot soup and bread rolls followed by chocolate cake and other yummy goodies.
This afternoon was made all the more better because a friend of mine who got married in America 3 weeks ago was also there with her husband, Todd.&nbsp; It was the first time I had met him and he is one of the loveliest blokes you could ever wish to meet (he's got quite a mean snowball throw too and always gets his target).&nbsp; Rebekah has really fallen on her feet and I know they will be happy forever (Todd also thinks Sean Bean is an excellent actor so he definitely gets the thumbs up from me *grin*).
I'm glad I'm not at work tomorrow as we have more snow forecast overnight - Zoe's going sledging in the morning with a friend and at some point I have to go shopping which I'm not looking forward to but we'll get by if we happen to be snowed in lol.&nbsp; Sara was up at 4.40am today as she had to be at work for 6am because it was the start of the 'Next' sale!&nbsp; She's absolutely shattered now and she said it was manic.&nbsp; The shop actually opened at 5am and people were queuing to get in!!!&nbsp; They must be mad lol.
Someone asked me today if I was going to make any New Year's resolutions and my initial reaction was 'no - I never keep any I do make' but after thinking about it I've decided I'm going to be an even better friend to those friends who have been there for me all this year.&nbsp; I have some fantastic friends and I know I don't appreciate them as much as I should do.&nbsp; I'm also going to be keeping a close eye&nbsp;on a friend who, although I've never met, is really special to me and is going through a tough time at the moment :o(
I'm also going to update more often&nbsp;too and to finish of this entry here's&nbsp;a picture of our snowy&nbsp;garden - will take some more tomorrow as this one's a bit dark.
