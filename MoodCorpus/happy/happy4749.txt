Goodbye Money, Hello Things I Don't Need But Want!!
Sukhpal and I went shopping today after I finished and handed in my last math assignment (so close to never having to bother with math again I can taste it)!!  I bought two new skirts and some high boots to go with them, as well as a few presents for people that I can now cross off my list!  I love going shopping with Sukhpal.  It's like all the nice clothes that I've longed for but could never find myself come out and attack her until she tells me to buy them.  

My staff party is comming up soon.  I'm excited for it.  Should be quite the event this year.  Our staff fund has a few thousand extra dollars in it from our last two good reviews (we win money for certain scores on out restaurant reviews that are done quarterly throughout the year).

We are going to a fancy place downtown for dinner (don't remember the name right now, it starts with a G), and then some horses and carrages are picking us up from the restaurant for a spin around town, and then they will drop us off at a bar for drinks afterwards.  And it looks like Tristen will be able to come with me.  I did invite my friend Jen to come along as my date (she used to work at Denny's), but it looks like someone's friend might not make it and they told me they'd take Tristen if that's the case.  Everything today was good!  Too bad I have to go to work tomorrow....bah!
