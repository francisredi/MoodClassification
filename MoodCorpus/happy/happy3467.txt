Who Loves Christmas? I DO!
Okay so it's Christmas time and HELLO! I'm pumped. I love getting people presents. Love love love it. Anyway, my friend Kathryn's mom works with like, kind of crazy people, like schitzophorenic and whatnot, and anyway, she mentioned something about one of her clients really wanted a scarf one day, and I had this scarf, hat, and gloves set that was just sitting around that I hadn't even pulled out of the box. So I gave the set to her to give to the lady, and I just got a thank you card tonight from the lady, and oh my gosh, it was the sweetest thing ever. She really loved it and was so so so excited about it. I was so happy, it completely made my day. I seriously love Christmas, and I love giving people presents. Anyway, this Sunday is one month for me and John. I'm pretty excited. And we're still like, perfect too, so I'm thinking this will last longer than all the other stupid guys I've been with. How nice am I? haha, but seriously, they really have been that bad. So how many people are loving my icon right now? I AM! Cillian Murphy is amazing. I only love him. Anyway, King Kong is coming out tomorrow, where I am anyway, I don't know when it came out for real, and I have to go see it to review it for my school newspaper, and I am not looking forward to it. Seriously, King Kong? Don't get the appeal. Although, Peter Jackson only did an amazing job with Lord of the Rings, so I guess he could pull it off. But the Lord of the Rings is an amazing trilogy too, and well, King Kong's originals, I'm not gonna lie, they're not that great. Anyway, if anyone's heard anything amazing and wants to fill me in, please do. Because I'm somewhat dreading going. Anyway, I guess I'm going to get going, I still have lots to do.
Merry Christmas if I don't write before then, and to all you high school kids, good luck on finals. I know mine are going to suck.
