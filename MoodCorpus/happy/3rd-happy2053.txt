i'm a bad girl
mmm yeah, so i kinda sorta neglected to do C yesterday. but its only because it was allready today by the time i got home. so i just went to bed instead of writing C. and so to make up for it, i shall do C and D together because it's only fair that way.
Cis for compliments. first of i would like to note that C is by far the best letter of the alphabet. but putting that aside, who does not absolutly love compliments. they really can make a persons day. i love giving people compliments, but only if its true. fake compliments are no good. but real ones are great. they make you feeel so awsome, and its just nice to know everyonce in a while that you look pretty, or you did a good job or something of that sort. so in the spirit of C, give someone a compliment. they deserve it, and SO DO YOU!!

D is for Driving. Driving is a pretty cool liberty. it not only is a "coming of age" type of thing, but it is like freedom on 4 wheels. personally, i like it when other people drive and i get shotgun (heh) but just the fact that i can drive is cool. i like knowing that i can go where ever i want when ever, as long as i remmeber to fill the tank anyways. but yeah, for those of you who can drive, props to you, and if you can't, don't wait long once you can, cause its really awsome. and for all of you driving, be safe please! cause D is for driving and you shoyuld drive safe!
