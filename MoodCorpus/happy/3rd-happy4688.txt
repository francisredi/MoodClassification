I spent the entire night alone in my room watching (from a distance) the beautiful display of fireworks in the black velvety sky (though not as much as the previous years since nations are still mourning for the Tsunami Victims). When the clock struck midnight, some kids who were celebrating at the playground shouted out "Happy New Year!!!" to the entire neighbourhood. They weren't the only ones doing so.

It was a good time to reminisce about old times, the friends who had came & went in a blink of an eye, the sorrow &amp; the joy & laughters... so many things had happened.

But life goes on.

2004 had been a wonderful &amp; memorable adventure for me. Yet another year had passed so quickly.

Once again, Happy New 2005 everyone~! May all your dreams + ambitions + whatever you guys set out to do gets fulfilled in due time~! Never give up & chase your dreams till they become a reality~!

January 1st is still just another day ne... the passing of another year is a reminder to people that time does not stop for anyone. We've all grown a year older, a year wiser. Lets all acknowledge that &amp; look forward to the future of endless possibilities.
