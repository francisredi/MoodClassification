Just call me Ms. PMP
Woot!!!
Those of you who were bored with my ramblings back in September may remember I was preparing for the PMP exam, and scored a 79%. At that point in time, you needed an 80% to pass.This was a brand new version of the exam and these metrics were based on preliminary testing and metrics from volunteers the summer previous, Needless to say, I was fairly crushed and depressed. In the meantime, I have eased off on myself and am not really down about it, more frustrated than not--and boggling over what to change in my study habits. I had decided to give myself a break and wait until after the holidays to re-take it.
Today,just minutes ago,I got an email from PMI saying that they have been monitoring performance for the first 800 people globally and have revised the pass point. Th enew pass point is a 61%, and I have now officially been deemed as PASSED the exam.

For thse of you that are lost in the dark, becuase I heedlessly used jargon, the PMI( Project Management Institute) globally certifies PMPs ( Project Management Professionals) This is a serious exam with a 4 hour time slot, of 200 questions that covers everything from staff handling, basic project management theory, finance calculations to purchasing and contract and legal issues. It was single handedly the hardest test I have ever taken, and preparing for it was a parallel to preparing for my Graduate Qualifying exams. For those of you familiar with it, it is equivalent to the Professional Engineer Exam. Passing it gives me the ability to put the letters PMP after my name, ( much like a CPA has letters after their name) and gives me significantly more job hiring flexibiity, if I should I  ever need it. It will also allow me to eventually ( ha ha no promotions this year for anyone) to qualify for a promotion at work!!) On a more tirvial letter, since I passed I can now apply for the 600$ fee to be re-imbursed to me by work!

Happy happy happy dance.
