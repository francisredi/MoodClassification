Robots, Lettuce, and Santa
Well,  called up yesterday because he was bored, so he came over, we went and had some lunch, and rented a movie.  But, as soon as we came back, the power went out.  So, we played chess until it got too dark to see, and he went home.  Next weekend we'll watch the movie! :P  Then,  called up to have a movie night with him and Andy, so we went out to Chili's and came back to watch the director's cut of Bladerunner.  Lenny and I love that movie, but I don't think Andy was very impressed.  All in all I had a splendid time, and it was nice people just called up randomly to start stuff.  Ah, this is what weekends are supposed to be like. :)

Also, I've let myself slip quite a bit in the past couple of months, but I'm going to get back on track of eating right and exercising religiously (beware, !)  My goal is to get back down to my college weight, which I think is very doable by summer.  Caesar salads, here I come! *grumblegrumble*

Oh, and later on this week I'm supposed to go on a shopping spree with Teryn for Christmas.  I'm really sick of the over-commercialization of this holiday... my goal is to not be subjected to any Christmas music until it's actually close to Christmas.  Anyway, I'm trying to find some ways of doing something special for family that doesn't involve lining the pockets of retailers.  If anyone has any suggestions, I'm open!
