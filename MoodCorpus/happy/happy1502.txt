funny dinner conversation
So my parents, Paul and Hannah are eating shrimp at the table behind me (as we currently speak, though Hannah just left the dinner table..)

And my mom is harassing Paul about being too quiet, and he politely explains that he is now sick as well (not to mention he loves shrimp, so he's chowing down).  Then Dad is just like, "yeah, he and Karynne have probably been swapping spit".  It was pretty funny, but my sister all freaked out and was like, "ugghhh, I don't want to hear that at the dinner table," yatta yatta yatta.

Well, Paul, being the funnyman that he is, proceeds to tell my family, "well, actually there's some truth to that.  See I use Karynne's toothpaste after she brushes her teeth with it".  At this comment I turn around and laugh: it was a pretty funny comment, then he responds "you know it's true.  You spit it into a little cup for me".  At this my sister backs her chair out from under the table, pitches a mini-hissy fit (she's 15 years old) and storms out of the dining area, proclaiming she has a problem with "human spit".  How very interesting.  We all enjoyed a good laugh, particularly knowing she'd eaten already and was just being ridiculous.  Besides, Paul's a pretty funny guy.

Just thought I'd share a cute-funny story...  I'm still sick but feeling better.  I just need to get down and dirrrty in school work already, I'm a damn procrastinator like crazy yo.
