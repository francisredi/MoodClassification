Christmas!
Hi! (And a late Merry Christmas!)
Christmas has been soooooo good this year. I've felt really Christmassy since about one or two weeks before Christmas. I loved it how all the meetings at church felt really Christmassy.
Yesterday (Christmas morning) I got up at 7:30. This is probably the latest I've ever got up for Christmas. I hope it doesn't mean I'm getting too old!!!!!! First thing was first- PRESENTS! There were literally loads of presents under the tree, and mum, Moppy and I took turns to open them one by one. You'll never guess what I got- an MP3 player! I didn't expect in a million years that I'd get one of those! I also got tons of chocolate, some gift vouchers, lots of shower stuff, two scarves, a watch, some jewellery, a stocking filled with chocolate and wee rubbers and stuff, pyjamas, perfume, (my very first bottle ever!) a Winnie the Pooh stationary box thing, a ginger cookie with 'ich ho lieb dich' written on it which means I love you in german, a white rose, socks, a puzzle book, sticky note things, a hairdryer and hairbrush and a hair clip. That's all I can remember just now- I've done well this year, don't you think!
Our meal was out of this world- mum and Darlene cooked it. We had turkey, chipolatas, mashed potato, other potato things, vegetables and stuffing, and then we had trifle and christmas pudding with cream for pudding. There was a lovely warm, friendly atmosphere in the house and it was one of the best Christmases ever. But I know that that was not because of the presents and the meal and even the family and friends, but because Jesus was with us and we were celebrating what He has done for us. That's what is making Christmas more and more special every year, not because the presents are getting better! (Although mum is doing a very good job of getting suitable presents for teenage girls- I can't believe how well she copes, and this year they were the best!)
Bye for now :-)
