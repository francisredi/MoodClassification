__1: And I don't know if you see me... 
I figured it might be good to do a little intro thing, although I'm sure it'll be awful because I am very awful with words. I'm Bethany Joy Lenz. I respond to Bethany, Joy, Bethany Joy, Joie, and several other combinations of my names. And I'm sure I'll respond to anything else, as long as it's nice.

I've yet to become a big star, which is alright with me. I'm happy where I am and doing the things I'm doing. The main thing that I've been kept busy with is filming on the WB's One Tree Hill. I play Haley and get to kiss James Lafferty and Tyler Hilton...both of whom I have huge crushes on, but shhhh. I've always been working on a new album that is set to release in 2006, and I've also been working with Tyler on that. 

When I'm not busy filming, I'm paling around with my best friends Sophia and Hilarie, both of whom are as insane as I am. We go shopping and attempt to cook with each other. The shopping ends well, but sadly the same can't be said for the cooking. But, if you're ever craving some burnt something-or-other, give me a call and I'll whip something up for you in a matter of minutes.

I like jokes a lot and have several corney ones up my sleeve. If you ever want something to make me like you immediatly, tell me some really stupid joke, and then when I tell you one back, laugh. You'll be my best friend. I also like board games, so if you'll play one with me while telling stupid jokes, you'll be my best friend forever. Because BFF is better than BF.

Was that as lame as I knew it would be? Yep. Even more, actually.

-Joie.
