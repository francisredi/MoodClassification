Merry Christmas
MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!Today has been spectacularly awesome. I got a lot of neato stuff for Christmas, I get to spend the majority of my day with Angela (something I've always wanted... SOMEONE to share Christmas with), AND my mom got a shower today!! (Long story made short: Mom had back problems two weeks ago, went in the hospital, and hasn't had a "real shower" since. She just got out of the hospital on Wednesday night, and just started walking around a bit yesterday.. so this is awesomeness)Kay, I woke up... blahblah... and then me and Angela gave my mom a little Christmas surprise by wearing matching santa hats... We were going to do a matching outfit thing, but well.. with my mom going in the hospital, stuff fell through. That's okay though. Mom got a shower, we all ate breakfast and then I got to open my gifts! Now, let's see if I remember everything...Mom and Dad:BubblesCrayola color pencils, crayons and markers (I lost all of mine in the flood), and a drawing tablet + a wire basket to hold it all in.A vibrating turtleA new Lord of the Rings + The Hobbit book setA necklace with a heart shaped pendantXena 10th Anniversary DVD setANDA PS2!!
