HEHEHE
I have an interview tomorow at 3pm at PetSmart! lol tomorow is thursday right?!. if i get the job that will be the 2nd time getting a job through candace. now thats interesting. oh jordan brought up a point yesterday that was kinda confusing but interesting at the same time:

Jordan is living with his best friends girl friend who is his best friend but is also dating her best friend. make sense? no? well thats ok. 

we were going to go out yesterday, but it was too cold so we just stayed at his place for what 11 hours. lol, most of them it was just me and him in his bed. no nothing happened! but he has really nice soft pillows! but only 2 of em, he needs more. I was saying how I have like 11 pillows for my twin bed, and he has a double, so that means he should have 22! 2 body pillows, 6 regular pillows, and the rest would be those square couch pillows. yup i make a whole nest outta my bed. and greg you know those blankets you have? he only uses 1! i need 2 or 3 comforters to make me happy! men! dont know how to make a proper bed! then again neither do a lot of people, cuz im crazy. Ya so anyway we watched a movie, and ordered pizza, i took a nap after our talking and he called kev cuz kevin was bored cuz candace was working(lol) and they played a game on ps2 until kev went to pick up his sister and candace from work. so ya it was all fun. then candace came home and showed us what she bought maxine for christmas!(her cat). maxine is starting to get used to me! yay, shes letting me pet her and play with her now and doesnt run away as much. shes so cute! like a larger short haired version of my cat, lucy.
