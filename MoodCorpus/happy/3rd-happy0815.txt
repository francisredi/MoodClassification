OMG YAY!!! 
I talked to my sister Helen on the phone twice today and I'm going to be visiting her in North Carolina December 21.I get out of school December 22.Here's what I think will happen Mom will lead Helen to my school in her car with Helen's van following behind they pick me up after I think going to a place called Pat's cheese steaks and I will go from school to North Carolina.If I end up in Washington D.C for a while while going to North Carolina that will absoulety fine with me since my stepmother Earleen.I shall survive as long as I have a computer and am in close contact with my friends my screenname in D.C is Cheetahgirlie362.I don't have a screenname in North Carolina yet I will let you all know if I ever get one anyway My sister Helen has a computer which is great what's not great is that it acts up sometimes and i guess is pretty slow which I can expect since the computer I'm on right now is slow.Helen said she will try and get her computer fixed so I can use it she said something like "There will be no lonely days without the computer" lol bless her heart I love my sister dearly she's so sweet such an angel she's like my disco twin because we both love the band the Bee Gees I guess that makes Jackie my online disco twin since she loves the Bee Gees too.I'm listening to them right now there are teachers in my school who love the Bee Gees one is a lunch aide named Ms.Karen Dougherty (or Karen D) and the other is my I.E.P (please don't ask what an I.E.P is its a little complicated and I had to have an I.E.P for math) teacher Ms.Gulianno when I was in 6th grade she had gone through her records at home and gave be the only Bee Gees record she had which was the Bee Gees 1st (in the 60's they were  trying to be the beatles) so I'm making a tape for them to give them for christmas.My sister Sherri will be coming tommrow and that means my nephew Spencer will be here so I'll be online because Spencer gets on my nerves I think he's still 4 more details tommrow.
