Best christmas ever!
So last night i went over to the wifes place to have christmas . It was the best! Everything just seemed so.....perfect! I've never seen anything like it in my entire life. It was like i was in a movie. My parents have never celebrated christmas like that. It was my little fairy tale christmas. The table was set up to eat, the tree was looking beautiful and there was so many presents. Never have i seen so many presents under one tree. Then when it was time to open presents i had so many! it was awesome! I got lots of puzzles that i cant wait to do! i got my favorite perfume in a set and lots more. Im so happy! It was great. My wife likes the presents i got her. Im so happy she does! She slept over last night! It was great having her by my side. Sleeping next to her or in her arms makes me feel so safe! I love it. So i went to work today and i realized.....this is the girl i want to be with for the rest of my life. I dont want anyone more than her. This is my soulmate. I can never get her out of my mind. Shes all i think of. Shes my everything. I put her before anyone. I want to her with her forever!
So indiana....this friday. It still hasnt hit me yet! why!? i want it to hit me already! like i want the day to come so bad. Im really excited about seeing snow. I hope i dont act too crazy when i see it.
