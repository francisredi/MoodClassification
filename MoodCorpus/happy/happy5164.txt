Second day of Holidays
It really hasn't quite sunk in yet that I'm done my first term of school. Yes I know I've mentioned it before, but it's really not quite sunk in. Though it should have because I was able to do this morning what I wouldn't have been able to if I'd been in class - I had a massage. Ooh, it was nice. My massage therapist is a sweetheart; so cute. And very nice. I'm looking forward very much to seeing her again in January.

Last night was our Destressor at school; just a couple of hours where everyone in the program (from all terms) got together and hung out. It was good to see so many people out. I was to have teh boy over for dinner last night, okay, I had asked him over for dinner, which was a tentative plan. Unfortunately it was more tentative than plan, which is cool by me because he didn't cancel on me, he had told me Monday night that he did need to get things done before he left for home this morning. So I had a different dinner guest last night. None other than . She cross-stitched while I made dinner, and I made an apple crisp which was SO good. I feel oh so domestic. *smirk*

So even though teh boy missed out on wonderful food and company,  got to benefit from it. Heh.

And I just realized that I've got to be on a bus in a half hour and I'm not near ready to get my butt downtown. Gotta run.

Everyone have a great weekend!
