finally a real post!

so i've been meaning to&nbsp;do a real post in a long time and i am finally getting around to doing it!!&nbsp; as you can see i have a picture of scottie pippen, phil jackson, and michael jordan up.&nbsp; this is because i went to the bulls vs. lakers game at the united center as i do every year.&nbsp; well it just happens that on this night they were retiring scottie pippen's jersey at half-time.&nbsp; talk about exciting!&nbsp; they had a big ceremony with those three, dennis rodman, randy brown, bill wennington, horace grant, and a bunch of others:

then they unveiled the jersey and it was so fun!&nbsp; we were a part of history in the making!&nbsp; i definitely won't forget that night!&nbsp; the pathetic part is i cried when they were showing all the highlights of his career.&nbsp; it made me think of my basketball career.&nbsp; yes, the picture and newspaper article filled scrapbook was looked at when i got home = )&nbsp; i'm starting to really get into basketball again.&nbsp; i think it is a passion that i will always have!

anyway!&nbsp; break has been glorious!!!&nbsp; being away from rockford college has been pretty darn good!&nbsp; i am missing a few people from there, as i expected, but i am not in any rush to get back.&nbsp; obviously from my previous post, i am missing alex a bit, but i am halfway through our four weeks of not seeing each other.&nbsp; oh, also no more anonymous commenting on my journal after the unneccessary drama of last night/this morning.&nbsp; so if you have been or were planning on posting anonymously, sorry!
friday i went out to dinner at T.G.I Fridays with mauricio.&nbsp; that was fun!&nbsp; i had not seen him in sooo long!&nbsp; so it was definitely nice to catch up.&nbsp; i am going to try and do a better job of keeping in touch with him.
my sister came home from california yesterday so that was pretty exciting.&nbsp; we are all one big happy family now. awwww...well not completely, but my sister lisa comes home on friday!&nbsp; yay!&nbsp; then we shall be complete!
