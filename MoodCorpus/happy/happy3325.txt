Huh...
 So since the party on Friday, my life has taken an interesting turn.  If you remember, dear readers, I proposed to Brandy at the party.  Well according to almost everyone in the 2009 screenwriting we are a 'couple', or an 'item', or if you will 'seeing each other'.
Saturday after the party I was hanging out at Julie's and Brandy came over, we continued our hugging to the dismay of Julie and Julianne.  We ended up hanging out most of the day, had the proverbial first kiss.  I went over to her place that night, we hung out.  Erik and Katie and Lauren were there.  Brandy, Lauren, Erik and I played Clue and I won (with a brilliant guess... Mrs White, in the Hall with the Rope).  I ended up hanging out with her until Sunday morning.  We parted ways so that she could go to church.  
Sunday afternoon we got pizza (or rather she went with me to get pizza).  Sunday night there was a study group at her place.  After studying she came back here with me and we did some studying... then we "watched" MASH.  The power went out cause this guy Namdi was over here filming a movie.  After the power went out we just hung out in the dark.  Then I walked her home.  
Monday night she came over after the Narrative Cinema test and we hung out until tuesday morning.
Tuesday night I am going to the bar with Alex and Dave... a nice little send off for the three of us.  Dave and I are leaving tomorrow for the Christmas Break.
