Xmas is coming :D
Its christmas eve and because im such a little boy im all excited. Xmas is my favourite day of the year for a very simple reason, its a day when everyone has a reasont o be happy, when people are much less likely to argue and fight or hurt each other. Its a day when people give to each other and people who havent seen each other a while get back together.

It brings with it unconditional happiness, its just wonderful.

Think about the world war 2 christmas, when our soldiers overheard the germans singing carols and eventually they joined in, no one was shooting at anybody, just singing. Then the officers from both sides found trust enough each other to meet up at the centre of the battlefeild and then both sides spent the day playing football. For that one christams day, even something as horrid as war was brushed aside and replaced by singing,fun and games.

I guess there are those who have their own reasons for not liking christmas and thats fair enough. For me though its so special, to see so much happiness, its never gets old, i love it so much.

Hey, i still have xmas cards to give out so im off to warehouse tonight to see if i can catch more people, anyone want to come?

If i dont see you there I'll take this opportunity to wish you all a very merry christmas, i love you all so so much.
