Good times.
Last night was so much fun! Kelli, Julie and I went out to a bar called Moxie's on Clark street. We drank 3 bottles of wine! and then Kelli and Julie started talking to all these guys that would come in. And there was this group of people who had just come from an "ugly sweater" party and they all had their sweaters on and we made good friends with all of them! it was kick ass.

Also, funny thing, my Theology teacher from last semester was there! I was like whoa! and I didn't know if i should go up and talk to him or what. So i was just dnacing, and then one of his friends came over and was talking to me, so I asked him if his friend taught at Loyola. And he said yes, so now I for sure knew it was my teacher. (although I knew b4, i just wanted to play it off like i wasn't) So like 10 mins after my theology teacher's friend was talking to me, Kelli and julie decided that wanted  to go. So on my way out I said hello to my teacher. He hugged me gave me a kiss on the check. it was sweet. I said something along the lines of oh i wasn't sure it was you and all that. And he was like oh yeah, I recognized you right away, but i didn't want to come over and cramp your style. Now i have to tell you, this theology teacher is a young, hot guy. But anyways...we were talking for a few and he was saying how his friends thought i was cute and all, but he told them to be careful because i was a good student lol. Then Julie told him that she thought he was really good looking, and he was like thanks, but i hope that's not just the alchohol talking. it was funny. Then we left.

We went to a different bar, decided we didn't like it and came back to Moxie's, had another bottle of wine, and then it was 2am and time to go home.
