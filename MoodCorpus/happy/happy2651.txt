(&nbsp;Bludhaven DFA Categories&nbsp;)
I am extremely excited and humbled by the fact that some of my stories won in various categories.&nbsp; Please forgive me if it sounds like I'm tooting my own horn.&nbsp; I'm just so extremely grateful that these little stories were voted on by those who read them, and maybe found a little something they&nbsp;deem enjoyable.
And I'm very touched to share this year's Dannell Lites Memorium Award.&nbsp; Dannell is no longer with us, but her stories remain a source of inspiration and entertainment.&nbsp; If you haven't read any of Dannell's work, I suggest that you give them a read.&nbsp; They're truly remarkable.&nbsp; She can be found here. And I've long been a fan of Syl Franics and to share this award with her is icing on the cake.
