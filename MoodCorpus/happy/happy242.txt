No day but today
I thoroughly enjoyed this four day weekend to the fullest.  Saturday I met Pete's whole family for the first time.  It's a yearly tradition they have where they all go see the new Harry Potter movie.  After the movie we went back to Maura and Jim's for pizza and then watched Sahara.  His family is really nice and it wasn't as nervewrecking as I had anticipated.  After the movie we hit up 507 with everyone again, it was a more mellow night than last weekend.  Well, not so mellow for Michelle who apparently got sick in the morning.  Sunday morning I spent with Pete and then he went out with his brothers so I took Eileen shopping and then my dad took us to get a Christmas tree, so we did that the rest of the night.  Then Pete called on his drive home and we talked for 2 1/2 hours straight - my phone was exhausted.  It was a nice talk, though.  I won't see him for 2 weeks but after that long stretch, I'll see him 4 weeks in a row.  Yay!  I'm excited that he's coming to the Christmas party with me.  I was telling Mary Ann today and she seemed more excited to see him there than I am.

Work today wasn't too bad.  My Andrew was back and kept me laughing all day.  At the end of the day I went in to see Joseph and had him hysterically laughing for like 15 minutes.  He is too adorable!  The only problem with visiting him so much is that when I leave the room, he cries hysterically. I heard him wailing from the office.  So I'm sure Miss Denise doesn't appreciate that too much. lol  Hopefully, these next 2 weeks go fast because then the weekends are going to be fun. :)

I guess that's about it.
