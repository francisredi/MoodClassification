growing distant in reality but closer at the same time
alright lets star off with the fact that i am about to have one of my best friends move to flordia. most people already know that cassie is moving to flordia in a few days. I am going to miss all the times that i would come hang out with her after school, and watching movies with her. i am going to miss helping her pick out what to wear and how to do her hair. i am pretty much going to miss almost everything about her. alright now here is the thing, cassie and I have had a lot of serious arguments and a lot of serious talks for the better, but recently we have had more conversations than ever before that i think have brought us closer together. Cassie and I have not had a argument in a while. anyone who hung out with us like 2 months ago would of seen more heated disputes than they had ever seen. I really am going to miss her. and especially her smile. The good thing is she is going to come back every monday or something like that so i will get to see her then. But besides just her being gone i am going to miss LB (little block) and Mrs. Sue. For one i am going to miss the fact that Mrs Sue always says "TAKE YOUR SHOES OFF AT THE DOOR!!!" that kinda makes me smile. and i am also going to miss reading stories with LB. The good thing about all this is i think i am going to go with cassie this weekend to Flordia for a few days. I think it will be good for us to have that time. Well lets see, these last couple of days have been good i guess. friday was good, i went and saw tori sing at the christmas singing get together. last night I went to a Poker Party it was ok. and today tori came over and we helped eachother with some study guide questions. i hung with cassie today and had to swim for my dear life when i was in her room so i didnt drowned. well i am watching Cinderella Man with her right now so i will talk to everyone later.

I LOVE YOU CASSIE (more than a friend, but dont worry tori or ryan, not like that)
