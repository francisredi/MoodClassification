It's a beautiful day
What a day, what a day!  Today was an awesome day!  Here's the breakdown of all the really great things that happened today:

1) I found over $100 worth of Cd's that have been missing for the past year!
2) My best friend from middle school called and said that she was gonna be in town for a bit with her husband so they dropped by to chat for a bit.  It was so awesome to see her, and we each have dates with each other, she's gonna visit me in Savannah sometime and I'm going back to Austin to see her again!!
3) My other best friend from elementary school (I wrote about her a few entries back) left me a message on myspace sayin that the next time I'm in Houston to let her know so that we can do lunch!!  Sadly, I won't get to see her for a good while since I'm leaving for Sav., but I've been chatting with her off and on a lot more lately so that has been really good!!
4) My dad decided to drive back to savannah with me in his truck, which means that we'll be able to get my great big queen sized, beauty rest, most comfortable bed EVER back with me and I'm gonna save a lot of $$$!!  I was kinda stressing about getting a bed for the new apartment, but now the stress is gone and all is grand!
5) I started packing for Savannah today!!  WooHoo!  I cleaned out my car, vacuumed it, and all that good stuff.  Due to the slight change of plans, we are now leaving on Wed. instead of Tues. which I feel better about.


All in all my day absofuckinlutely ROCKED MY SOCKS!!  Pardon my french! ;)

Peace out homeslices!
