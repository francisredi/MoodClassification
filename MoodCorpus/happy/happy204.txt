Thanksgiving weekend
Well thanksgiving turned out very well with only a few hiccups in the beginning.  It was fun running around trying to get everyone together.  We even got Jake to go!! Which was great because he hardly ever goes to these functions.  But who can blame him, poor guy.  The downside of the night was not being able to meet the INFAMOUS "Wendy".  I hear so much about her and I met her once at kim's wedding. I was VERY dissappointed. It's like hearing about Santa Claus and not being able to meet him each and every time.  O well eventually I will meet this "INFAMOUS" Wendy.  Dissapointment aside it was a great night with so much food that no one wanted to take any of it home.  It was also Dave's dad's birthday and we sang and gave him a cherry pie!!  Aiden had the most fun because he would drag everyone outside to play with him.  When everyone left he was sad and kept saying "gone, everyone's gooone".  After dinner David, his dad, aunt and cousin played mario party together which was a lot of fun. While they were playing teri and I watched survior.  Everyone was so full that the next day that they had stomach aches.  The next night we all played galaxy quest.  I never played it before so I was out first.  Dave and his dad dueled it out and David eventually won.  On Satuday we put up our christmas lights on both houses.  They look great and Aiden loves them, he "ooo's and ahh's" and points to them.  After we got the whole P clan together and went to the mall TRY to take pictures with Santa but Aiden would have none of it!! So April ended up taking them by herself.  I guess we will have to wait till next year.  By Sunday we took it easy!!  It was a fun weekend, I thought it would never end. This next weekend we are going to try to get our Christmas Trees and we are starting decorate around the house.
