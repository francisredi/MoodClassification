just a quick update
The bus to go home is leaving from Corey Union at 3:00. I don't want to wait that long, lol. I want to leave already and get home. I've been anxious to get home. I hope it doesn't take longer to get home, because MTA has been on strike for 3 days now. It's crazy. If you don't know, the subways haven't been running for 3 days because of the strike. I was thinking to myself "oh great, Manhattan is going to be pure hell with all the cars driving through" (even though it's hell driving through there as it is, lol) but there's a rule that a car has to have 4 people in order to be driving in Manhattan. So that's good. There won't be as many cars as I thought. Keith said that one of the teachers at his school lives in Manhattan and commutes to the school everyday (which is probably about 10 miles from Manhattan or so) and he spent $75 taking a cab to the school!! I'm sure the cabbies are jacking up their prices too, since they're obviously in really big demand. On tv they're showing people walking across the Brooklyn Bridge to get from Manhattan to Brooklyn, crazy. My dad and I are still going into the city a couple days after Christmas. We're still going if the strike is still in effect. He said we'll just walk around but not stay as long. It should be fun though.

So I get to see Keith and my dad tonight!! My 2 favorite men in the whole world, hehe. I'm really excited for that. And the rest of my family, and my cats, of course. It will be so nice to be home for a month :-)

And I get to see and play my drums tomorrow!!!!! It may take all day to set up though, lol. You have to build the electronic sets. But it will be fun.

Well that's about it. I'll update in a couple days or so. Have a good holiday everyone.
