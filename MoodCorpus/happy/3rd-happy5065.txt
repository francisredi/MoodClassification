*slumps gratefully into a chair and whimpers about cars*
So, even though I've spent most of my weekend in my car, I had a really, really great time.
I took Joey to the airport, made a crap-ton of candy, finished all of my shopping and wrapping, hung out with friends from work, enjoyed christmas eve with Pat's family, enjoyed christmas day with my family (which includes Amanda and Damon), picked Joey up from the airport and enjoyed day after christmas fun with him and sister and mom, and am finally updating my journal. 
I am very tired, but happy.
I know some people will roll their eyes at this part, but I had a lot of fun hanging out with Pat's family. They're really, really cool, and they didn't seem to hate me, so... yay!!! Plus, Pat got me a really nice present. but now I'm fucked, cause I didn't know what to get him for christmas, and now I have his birthday coming up in about two weeks, and I still have no clue. I think the extreme amounts of vauge when it comes to gift ideas is revenge for every crazy thing girls ever do to boys. I'm just sayin'.
Going to sleep for now, but i'm debating on two project ideas. One is a regular book, which I may end up turning into a romance novel, just cause thoses seem to sell really well. *sighs* Second is the comic, and now I have a few of the tools I'll need to do that with. :D
Off to sleep.
