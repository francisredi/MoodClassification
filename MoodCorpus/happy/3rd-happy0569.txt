Sol
Sol got home pretty late last night because one of his employees had a dead battery, so they had to jump the car.

He called on his way home asking about eating out, so we could try and finally get out to do some Christmas shopping.  I told him we shouldn't be spending the money.

So he went to Safeway.  Got me some root beer.

Came home, washed dishes, and made dinner even though he didn't feel like it.  All while he let me sleep, only waking me up when he first came home to say hello and again when dinner was ready.  I apologized for not helping, knowing he'd had a long day too.

He just said it was alright, he knows I do a lot too.  Then he brought me dinner and we fell asleep cuddling.

His unending love is just amazing to me.  He's so understanding and patient.

When I was upset the other night, he came in, cuddled me for a little bit, let me talk about why I was unhappy before going to get the laundry.

Last Sunday when my family was down for the church Christmas performance, we called afterward and were going to pick him up to go out to eat.  He chose to stay home and clean the apartment, including putting up the Christmas tree and dealing with some of MY messes.

Wednesday when we went out to eat, he paid for dinner.  During the movie he kept giving me little forehead kisses.  Even though he didn't really want to be there.

Sol is an amazing man.
