if I ask for the sky, will you still shelter me when the sky falls?
So I find myself not working this lovely Tuesday, and I have to say it's been a very fullfilling day. I didnt win the lottery, or meet the love of my life, but I did get take my roommate to get her... self... pierced (take that as you will) and it was pretty damn cool. I upped my ears a gauge, switched from my lil glow plastic ones to nice metal ones that clink together when I shake my head, very satisfying for some reason. Also went to the malls, got some Christmas shopping done. I have to say that I just love the holidays. I have such a wondeful family, and although I spend the majority of my time away from them, I can happily say that the end of December and all it's wonder really makes me wanna go home and drink some rum and egg nog in front of my woodstove and make fun of my dad for putting on some French movie no one likes.... and there's always getting woken up Christmas morning by my dad blasting Satan's themesong from our massive speakers, because of course Im still in bed at 10am hungover from wandering in late on Christmas eve. 

Anyways.

After the all day excursion with Jenn I headed to the boys house to watch House and Nip/Tuck, which was a warm fuzzy holiday episode involving dead babies... and now it's 11:30 and I am home for the night! Holy moly. I have to say I'm impressed. I also had a really good night on Sunday, saw Dane Cook which was the best thing ever, and hung out with Kerri and some of the Crobar crew, was up wrestling with cats and egg and chesse mcmuffins till about 4am, everyone deff had me laughing my ass off all night dispite the fact that the partying plans fell short after 1am. 

In party news, Therapy and Ultra are havin some doozies soon, Avalon and Rise as well, and I plan on leadin the pack in search of sunrise as always.....
