weekend
good weekend was had. Thursday was a snow day!!  which was kinda cool, but just means that classes and my ITAC exam got postponed to tuesday, which actually causes me more problems.  went out in the freezing weather to 6th to celebrate jen's bday.. goood times, just cold!  friday by the time i got up and got myself awake and not feeling so hungover, it was time to me to start getting ready for the ballet.  which incidentally i ended up waiting till the last minute and only had about an hour to get all dolled up.  but mikey got here, and i must say we were a damn good looking couple.  dinner at eddie v's was delicious, and martinis were absolutely delicious.  the ballet was amazing, i LOVE LOVE LOVE the nutcracker. And it definitely got me into the christmas spirit.  then it everything goes to hell when i start drinking martinis as sherlocks.  i think mikeys goal was to get me completely wasted, which is exactly what happened.  the whole night consisted of 11 martinis and a glass of champagne.  how i walked out of the bar is a mystery.  got back home, stole some hubcaps, watched a lil cowbell, then PASSED out...  saturday morning woke up still drunk as shit... mikey and i tried to get some brunch at abels but of course they have shitty service, so we hit up double daves for a pitcher and some pepperoni rolls, watched UT get spanked, then i watched vince get beat by flippin reggie bush!  GRRRR

today i went out for brunch with michael since he was in town for the weekend, it was nice to see him and catch up.  other than that haven't been doing too much, ready for this semester to be O-V-E-R!  less than a week... ahhhh

oh yeah i got ditched for brunch today by someone... GRRRR oh well

things are better
