Christmas Joy
MERRY CHRISTMAS EVERYBODY!

I hope you're all having a good time.

I've been having a blast, really - last night was incredibly funny as I ate, drank and was merry en famille, and then my mother produced stickers and paper for us to create scenes. OMG BEST THING EVVARR hahaha. I will scan in the results at some point, it was great! More entertainment was provided today in the form of an incredibly cheap racing car set from Superdrug. 

It does not take a lot to make me very very happy.

Naturally, already had main present, but received an awful lot of books from various sources, and they're all extremely geeky in one way or another - ranging from a French dictionary to The History Boys script to 1001 Albums You Must Own (great title!) to a novel based on Doctor Who (essentially, glammed up fanfic). Yaaaaaay!

For the first time ever, I think, however, no CDs, but I have vouchers instead so it's all good! Actually, one other thing which I got very excited about - a really nice notebook from Paperchase, specially chosen and then labelled accordingly so that I can fit it in my pocket and take it to gigs to make notes on setlists etc! 

My parents rule. 

Right, chocolate gluttony calls. Between us, we have so much stuff from Hotel Chocolat it's ridiculous. I'm guessing that goes for most of St Albans and the surrounding area though, right?
