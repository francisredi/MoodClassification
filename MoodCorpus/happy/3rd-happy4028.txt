No Shit...There I was..
Minding my own business, eating a dinner that Shauna had just cooked.  When who should come walking through the door?  Keegan!  (Actually I knew he was coming about 5 minutes earlier, when he called saying he was lost and couldn't find our house :)  

He had made the last minute decision on Thurs pm to drive out here.  Without telling US of course. (Or the military for that matter!)  Merry Christmas!  I didn't tell anyone else in the house that he was about to walk in the door, just so I could see their faces.  It was great :)

He has to leave Christmas night because he has to pick his girlfriend up at the airport on Monday morning.  Sacha is probably going to ride back with him rather than going by the bus.  That's a long ride on the bus.  They can keep each other company, she gets home sooner, and she can help him stay awake.  Depending on if his girlfriend, Kat, is ok with it, Sacha may even drive part of it. (Keegan has Kat's car since she took his car keys to Vegas with her to see her folks).

We are doing our big dinner tonight so that we aren't spending all of Christmas day cooking and cleaning.  We're gonna spend tomorrow relaxing and visiting with the kids, mother-in-law, and my brother- and sister-in-law.

Hope everyone has a wonderful holiday with their families and/or friends.
