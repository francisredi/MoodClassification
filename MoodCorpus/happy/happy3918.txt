HAPPY BIRTHDAY ONYX!
Yay! My puppie's one year old as of yesterday. He's 90 pounds and he's probably going to get bigger but I love him to death. We had a faux birthday party for him with cake and presents and everything. Then he got to see his friend for a little romp in the sand (I can't remember her name though- Madison? Aaron? I dunnae know...). Which was kind of funny because she wasn't out with her normal human but with a cool girl about my age having a smoke. Our dogs knew eachother, though, so it was quite funny. The girl pup circled Onyx over and over until their leashes were tangled and Onyx was scared, so I took them to the volleyball "court" (sand pit, more like) because he knows it's playtime when he's in there and he thought she was being aggressive. Then I took the leash off of them and let them play for 15 minutes or so but me and the other girl took off our shoes and joined them because the girl pup was much more energetic and Onyx kept looking at me like "Is she trying to eat me or are we playing?" It was awesome after that. Life's weird. Who would have thought I'd end up running around barefoot in the sand with some random person and lost a leash and one shoe in the sand when the plan was just a quick stroll? It was way fun for everyone, but the girl is just visitin for a few days so we can't really hang and be friends :( Thanks for bearing with me ya'll in this waaay too long entry, but I love my dog and I wanted to pay homage to his b-day. Happy B-day, Onyx!
