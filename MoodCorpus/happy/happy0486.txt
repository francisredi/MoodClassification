Sweet Night
Fast and sweet tonight.  Got more than a little tipsy on some fine, fine wine by a woman my mom and I work for.  A sweetheart.  Who enjoyed getting a little drunk with us and love my tattoos and piercings.  I LOVE that woman!! And she has plans to try and hook me up with her very cute grandson.  I completely approve.  ;-)

After gettin' tipsy and driving slow so my even more tipsy mother could follow me, lol, I swung by Magic Needle and got another piercing.  Goin' industrial, baby!  I love that place and the guys are so wonderful.  Had just as much fun hangin' out and having a smoke with them as I did getting another hole punched in me, lol.  And of course there was the inuendo about how much I like that.  And of course it's true. ;-)  Also talked with the guy I get my tattoos from, Eric, about my next one and I am very excited about it. I love that place and those crazy cute guys!

Oh, and the guy who does my piercings, Lawler, invited me to Hard Metal Night at Flashback (right next to Magic Needle) and encouraged me to bring some friends, perferably cute girls, lol.  Now, usually, I wouldn't be caught dead at Flashback, but this night will be different.  Lawler is opening and hosting the event and I totally trust him to not have any part of something lame.  Seriously.  And there will be plenty of cheap drinks for those who are so inclined to get wasted.  I plan to.  Well, not wasted, cuz I don't do wasted, but cheap drinks will work for a little buz for the evening.  Anyways, Dec. 29th, I think it'll be cool and I plan to attend with as many people as are willing to join me for them evening.  Steve - come with me, we'll make it fun, lol.  

OK.  I'm gonna go play Halo 2, enjoy the rest of my evening with  my throbbing cartilege piercing, and start a new day in a few hours.  I'm feelin' pretty good about it. :-)
