Okay Merry, Heres my intro
Howdy Folks,

 on the group my ID is "Fiver", the chats its "Hazelrah1", and in real life most of you call me "Mel". I have been with AOME since shortly before Dcon 2004 when I was just a member. I have been a fan of LOTR now for over 2 decades(good grief..I just really gave away my age didnt I?), but it took the movies to get me into the cosplay. My favorite Tolkien book is "The Hobbit", and my favorite character is Bilbo. My only LOTR costume right now is Frodo. If I had the time, I would love to make a Bilbo costume. I have noticed that very few people tend to cosplay him. I have many fond memories all attached to these stories/films. I remember my friend and I sitting in a theater when the first teaser trailer came out with the Fellowship walking through the mountains. We both completely freaked because instantly we knew what it was. I'm looking forward to "The Hobbit" as it seems its only a matter of time before that one gets made. 

 Outside of the group, I am married to "Bill the Pony", and many of you know my son or at least his nickname Matthew "Aka. Little Rog". We live in the Shire...of Flowery Branch,Ga. Our house has served as "Bag End" for wayward travelers of this group for over a year. I'm a member of the Atlanta LOTR group, and the Atlanta HP group. I'm a huge Harry Potter fan and I cosplay as a Slytherin Student(Mel-ificent Malfoy). Chris and I are big fans of Anime which is slowly taking over our media collection. I love all things Japanese! I'm a black belt in Tae Kwan Do currently working towards my second degree(which will take 2yrs!). Chris and I both sing in the church choir. 
Okay I've bored Y'all enough....your turns!
