Dirty Pennies
Last night i saw the elusive, exclusive Erik Petersen. He played some awesome songs. He played "Fairytale of New York" by the Pogues, and it was an amazing cover. There were only four people singing along (including me)...which is weird, because everybody is always singing along to every word that comes out of his mouth. All in all it was a very good day.
I am reading this very awesome pirate book that Corey got me for Christmas, it is a great present. ((TTHHAANNKKSS CCOORREEYY!!)) 
Today is the start of Christmas break. Christmas day, a day when everyone puts there narcissistic ways behind them for minutes at a time, to exchange gifts, and pleasent conversations fill the air. Music plays gently in the backround, and by the end of the day you feel really good about yourself, and the people you tend to associate yourselves with. I hold Christmas pretty high on my "Favorite Days of the Year" list. The days leading up to it, of course, as some would say "suck" pretty "hard". Filled with consumerism and capitolism, and of course commercialism. But Christmas day, its just a very nice day. 
Tomorrow is Noel Neary's birthday, and im going to do something for her birthday, what it is, i havent the slightest idea...
I wrote a poem two days back, and i kind of like it. 
I need to write some more songs, i've been slacking in that area for a while.
I'm going to see the Bouncing Souls and Leftover Crack with Chris DeBlasi and his brother-in-law. Its gonna be a good time. I also plan on going to see the Dissenters Last Show, its gonna be a good, nice christmas break.
Well, that is all i can think to write about for now, i may be back later tonight, or tomorrow night, who knows.
