ahhhhhhhhhh break  (That was a sigh)
So yesterday after my last final (diction) I went home, took a shower, and left river falls, and left my parents' house.  Gawd I hate that place.  So i have been in Cannon the today and yesterday.  What a relief!  I love being back here with decent people!  I went out to eat with the "rented" 'rents at the Mill Street Tavern.  Finally back to a bar where they allow any age to actually eat!  So there's my rant for tonight.   I just have to say that it's great to be on break, and I am happy to annouce that I actually PASSED MUSIC HISTORY!!!!!  I got a B, and I am ecstatic!  I literally danced around the room when I found out last night.  Other than that.  I got together with a few girls from high school last night.  A little odd because only ever talked to one of them, but hey, it was nice just to see them.  Today was the best day ever.  Jess got me out of bed, and I talked to her for about an hour, and then Trent called me twice while I was on the phone with her, so I called him back.  I talked to him for about an hour.  (I am still in my pj's talking to these people at noonish)  And then I called my buddy Big Dave from Pine City.  An ex's best friend.  Weird, I know, but the kid and I are so much alike, we just can't NOT talk to each other.  So I talked to him for about an hour.  Then I watched Two Weeks Notice and figured that around 1:30ish I would actually take a shower in case my ex (the one I lived next to) wanted to stop by.  HAHAH YEAH RIGHT, the kid would probably murder me if he ever saw me again.  Whatever.  I don't care anymore.  I try to be nice, but the kid's a prick.  So after my shower, I watched the Wedding planner, and then some other tv.  Yesssssssssssssss.  The boob tube was in full swing today!  Anywho.... I shouldn't tie up the lines anymore.  I have dial-up here.  Keep in touch over break!  And I miss all of you already!
