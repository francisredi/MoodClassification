Strange daz
Work is pretty good, have been doing well on my features and add's.&nbsp; I still need to work on my rate plan mix, for some reason that is hard due to the way I seem to get all the family plans.
I got off work last night and we went to Sheplers (Western Store) and got Dale some sweat shirts.&nbsp; They had been like $40 and they were&nbsp; on sale for $29.99 they are nice sweat shirts he wears them for work its gets very cold in the ware house in the winter.&nbsp; We also stopped by Cato's and got me a new pair of pants and my husband got me a new coat.&nbsp; We also went to Wal-mart and picked up some new Cd's I got a Karaoke CD with like 60 songs, its pretty good I want to get back into going to sing again, it has been since Tulsa that I sang.&nbsp; We always have a good time going shopping.
When we got home I got an email from an old friend of mine James, I worked with him in Ada, he and his wife has split up.&nbsp; I really hate that they have been together for 15 years or more I think.&nbsp; He is a good man he really helped me in some bad times back when we worked in Ada together.&nbsp; I sent him an email back I hope he gives me a call, I told him I was there for him what ever he needed.
I talked to Steve last night for a while too, he was having problems with his computer, he had gone and got software for Norton and updated his computer, I think that is what his problem was, but I guess he will get it fixed up.
I work from 11:30-9:30 today I am sure it will be busy as hell at the store, I should do well on activations and features today however with the holidays just a couple days away.
Well not really much going on but wanted to update...
Oh yea I talked to my Friend Robert on line last night too, he gave me some information on Radiators...lol I adored the info so don't think I didn't Robert....He has been a little under the weather himself I hope he gets to feeling better. 
Well I better get my shirt on and get ready for work...talk to you people later...
