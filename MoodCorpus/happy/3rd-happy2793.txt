This Was So Stupid I Had to Chronicle It
Today was alright.
I woke up at 7:40 and went to bring Joe to school and then to get a haircut. I hadn't had one since August 7th when Tim shaved my head. It had grown in really long and thick since then so I had to get rid of the Partridge Family look. Came home, had a snack, and then slept for five hours since I was talking to Jaime until almost 4am. last night. Got up, ate dinner, watched "Seinfeld" and "That 70's Show" and then came online. I got bored waiting for my friends page to load because my connection is slow as molasses so I put on my mix CD. and started dancing and singing. It was about this point that I realized I looked like a total 50's guy after my haircut. I had on the straight cut white-boy jeans, high-top sneakers, plain white t-shirt, and now the sqaured off haircut. All I was missing was the pack of ciggs. to roll up in my sleeve. I looked kinda like Hank Hill without glasses even though for one point I put on my fake Buddy Holly glasses and then I just did look like a fat Hank Hill. Anyways my Elvis came on and I started dancing, doing the strut, snapping my fingers and hopping around, then curling up my lip and doing the pelvis shake and hump during the chorus before crashing through my bed crowd-diving during the solo. I rock hard.


Hopefully later this week we'll play football. If the Giants beat the Redskins on Saturday, they win their division and make the playoffs. That would be awesome, they haven't won since 2000. I found out I'm not opening presents until the 26th because mom is going out of town with boyfriend. Oh well, I'll be having fun all weekend over at dad's anyway. Hopefully I see more of Matt and Bill this week too.


Random Mike Fact: Mike can do a dead-on impression of the Elvis pelvis shake. It's sexy.
