HELL WEEK
Lets see, whats new... Well yesterday I was in Minneapolis to visit some friends, then my bro and I headed up to my cousins graduation party in Elk River (45 min north).  Saw some family and a bunch of my cousins which was fun:) Let me tell you tho, if you are in need of free birth control, go watch my aunts kids for a night, guaranteed everything in sight including you will be destroyed!  Got home super late only to pass out on the couch, (since my bed was buried in my trashed room, at least you can see the carpeting now) watching Viva La Bam.

2 tests this week and I'm done... AS IN GRADUATING DONE!  It has really hit me in the past few weeks... There will be no getting up early to go to class??? WHAT!?!?!  This week is going to be a trying one tho, work and class... 11pm-7am tonight, home to sleep a bit then back for 3-11 Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday along with class/tests Tuesday and Thursday mornings:(

On another note, I think I fell off the couch last night and smacked my head on the table... It seriously feels like I was punched in the eye, like right in the corner by my nose!  I don't have any recollection of it because once I'm out, I'M OUT!

I've been in a better mood lately, 2 classes down and 2 more to go!! That reminds me, I'll have extra $$ this week from selling books back, it's the little things that make my day!  Ok... Time to get my ass ready for work...
