Good News!!!
So, I've got some good news!  Neil proposed to me on Friday and I said YES!  It was awesome.  To tell you the truth I felt like this day was never going to come (we've been dating for 2.5 years) and when it did finally happen it felt sureal!  I mean it still hasn't sunk in it!  It's amazing.  

So, he invited me over for dinner, he was going to make me Thai Chicken.  He wanted me to be there @ 5:30, but I couldn't make it there by that time cuz of my work schedule.  So, I finally got there around 6:30.  He was in the kitchen warming up dinner.  He walked me out into the living room, where he had cleared out the center where the coffee table was and he set up a little table and make it look like a cute "table for 2" right in front of the Christmas tree.  I didn't think much of it cuz I was having a bad week @ work and I didn't think he'd propose until next year.  So, we sat for about 30-45 mins talking and eating and then he broke into it "So, we've been together for 2.5 years..." and he asked me.  He then had a limo pick us up and take us all around Grosse Pointe & then to Downtown Detroit.  It was great.  The limo also took us to each of our family's houses (my parents, his parents, and his sisters).  It was a wonderful evening! :)  

We had a busy weekend on top of that.  We had a wedding last night we went to and then tonight we had the Mitchell Family Christmas as I like to put it :)  It was fun!  I'm just exhausted cuz I have so much to do at work that I went in yesterday morning really early and then I worked for another 5-6 hours today and I'm still not done.  My manager isn't too happy about it, but there isn't anything else I can do.  Oh well.  Well, I hope everyone had a good weekend! :)
