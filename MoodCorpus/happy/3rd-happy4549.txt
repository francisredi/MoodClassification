christmas was well spent
dad decided to teach kev, cage and i a lesson as well as learn about us.

started the day going to mom's house where it was christmas in the fast lane. there are always 3 different conversations going on, 5 people talking and people coming up and down the stairs. it's a crazy busy household. i was truly exhausted when i came home that i took a nap to recharge myself. ate hot pot with daddy. he suggested that we head out.

we headed to the casino.

a little while ago i had a few things to say about our experience at the casino as 'quality family time' in fact, it was a great time and we had a ton of fun (some more than others right bro?). now all those thoughts have escaped me. the casino scene isn't one that i really like actually. previous to this i have only been twice, once was for emily's birthday and i spent more money on gas than at the casino, the second time, my friend and i walked through the casino in niagera and realized that it wasn't for us and left, didn't spend anything.

i am a reckless gambler. it's dangerous actually. i lost about $45 dollars actually. yeah i know, but it could have been worse and i know it. dad decided to use all of this gambling to teach us a lesson. i learned a lot about myself, my boyfriend and my brother from the way that they gamble. i love that daddy is analytical.
