Merry Christmas Holidays!
The drive down to Southern California wasn't bad at all.  Normally my sister drives but since I was driving, time went by pretty fast.  

Tonight our big family got together, as we do every year, and played the White Elephant game.  I gave out a $20 Best Buy gift certificate.  I know it's not original but people find it useful. Better than the crappy Chia pet gift someone brings every year.  I ended up getting a box of chocolate + $20 bill.  

I now await my cousin to call me so his friends and I can get together and have an Age of Empires III marathon.  I'm sure we won't get any sleep tonight, but it'll be fun!  I suck at RTS games, but nothing beats a LAN party.

I was originally going to drive back up in the next few days since I don't have work until Jan. 2, 2006, but instead some family, friends, and I are going to go snowboarding at Lake Tahoe.  FOrtunately my sister's coworker's mother-in-law has a cabin she does not use at all. She rented it out to us for only $82 a night, which is cheap considering there are 7 of us going.  It's a 2-bedroom, 2-bathroom cabin with fireplace and kitchen.  It should be really fun! I haven't been snowboarding in about 4 years!!  I hope I still remember how to snowboard.  I was pretty good at it so I hope to be back at the slopes doing my tricks.  Boo-ya!  I checked weather.com and it shows it's going to be a snowstorm on New Year's even and New Year's day.  I hope we don't get snowed in.  I better get some chains for my tire.  I hope my little Camry can make it up the snowy hill.  If I don't make it back, I want my iPod Nano to be sold and the proceeds will go to the NRA. 

Thank you and happy holidays!  See you in 2006!
