Mistaken Identity
My hair is now cornrowed. It came out pretty odd looking, but now my hair is out of my way, so I'm happy.

I was hanging out with Heather at the gas station qwik-y-mart where she works, when this five year old came in with her dad. He was a black coat and jeans, and she wore a pink coat and purple mittens. The little girl saw me when she came in and acted scared/shy.
So I go back to chatting with Heather, until I feel something clinging to my leg. I look down and see the little girl grabbing my left leg for protection while staring up at Heather in fearful curiosity.
I looked over my shoulder and saw that her father was getting coffee just behind me. The little girl must have come around the corner and mixed up which leg to cling to, because her father and I both had a black jacket and jeans on. 
I felt this weird, instant sort of protectiveness (that's how the little buggers suck you in!)but I nervously shuffled a little to my right and murmured, "Ah, um..I think I'm the wrong person."

The little girl looked up at me and a mixture of horror and surprise flickered over her cute little face. She whirled around in a mini-panic, only to find her father right behind her at the opposite counter, making coffee still. Like a pink leech of cuteness, she immediately latched onto him. 

It was rather funny how it demonstrated that a little kid's world is just a sea of legs.
