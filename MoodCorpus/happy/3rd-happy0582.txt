intensification baby.
the last 4 months in Nancy.

ive been amazingly lucky to be able to do so many things, see so many places, meet so many wonderful people. As we all say good-bye to those amongst us who have become like family, the inevitability of the rollercoaster syndrome is clear. Ive said it before, and ill say it again; im not one to pretend to have feelings i dont - when i use the terminology 'like family' i mean that because we have all spent every single day together, the intensification of friendships that could otherwise take years to develop occurs without one being able to stop it. 
Through these past few months i have made a series of decisions, for which there will be short, and long term consequences. Nonetheless, i feel prepared to embrace the certainty and uncertainty of these as they drip in. my dad says he thinks ive grown a lot in the last six months, the last year. i wonder sometimes about that; have i really changed? or is that he sees me with a different perception now that he hasnt had me around 24-7? 
i came to europe with two objectives. whilst they may not have been the best, as he initially told me, he's supported me every step of the way - and i think now begins to see the purpose of my leaving. I know coming home wont be the same- i know things change, thats something i was prepared to encounter regardless-
today im happy, im relaxed. i know things will work out. im still very in much in love with an amazing individual. my parents' health is well in order. through the oceans have blossomed what i hope will be other amazing friendships. 
to my sister, my omnipresent home icon -
to my parents, my role models - 
to my friends at home, my early morning advisers, my couriers - 
to my friends at ICN, my shoulders, my elves, the power, the G3 -
to My fountain of strength, the first thing in My Mind each day -


for who i am today, and all that i aspire to one day become 


i say thank you 


this is Danny. over and out.
