"Speaking words of wisdom, let it be"
So Christmas is over and apart from being very quick, it was the best one ever. Drugs have played a part in the festivities. I saw in Christmas with Rob Oliver, Jack Allinson, Joe Fuller, Rob Sladden, Tim Heapy and Mary Jane. lol. This is how I would like to see in New Year's too.

Christmas day itself was cool, I got a shit load of clothes, including the skate shoes I wanted which was phat. The whole 'family thing' was great, I don't spend much time with the rents now so it has been good to dedicate the majority of the day to them.

In the evening I went out with Rob, Ben and Tim, smoked some weed and played Halo, sounds very familiar, lol.

It made a change to have a Christmas where something shit hadn't happened. Three years ago, my nan had a stroke on Christmas Day, two years ago, my dad had a broken leg, last year we lost Penny. This year, everything has been great, gave me a big sigh of relief.

Tonight it looks as though I am going Canterbury for the night for booze, drugs and Dark Side of The Rainbow. I was intending to do that round mine with a few friends, but numbers increased so I had to cancel it, bit of a cunt.

New Year's looks as though it will be spent in Corringham, I think I may just walk around and see what I find, lol.

I havent straightened my hair in days, the boof is trying to come back.

Much love. x
