Christmas Update!
I keep forgetting to update because I'm on computers that don't have live journal as my home page. (Oh, well. Once I get back to Stanford, I'll have a constant reminder to do.)

Anyways, it's been an interesting Christmas (Robin says I overuse the word interesting, which I do.) It was the first Christmas being married and thus was the first year of a "rotating" Christmas. Dec 25th was spent at the Deis household. It was a very nice Christmas and I didn't feel as odd as I would expect to feel celebrating away from my family. I've spent a lot of time with Robin's family, so I did feel that I fit in. I imagine if I hadn't spent lots of time with them, that it probably would have felt weird.

We had a fairly traditional Deis family Christmas (this I cannot fully confirm without asking Robin because she is reading a book and I don't want to disturb her at the moment.) complete with the traditional, no-presents-until-after-breakfast rule, a Greek dinner and hiking socks for stockings. (These three things being the major differences. Well, the other major difference is the type of Christmas tree. I'll ) 

Today, we drove up to Redding to find a second Christmas (a lot Christmas than I was expecting.) Everyone got presents. Robin and I got stockings here in Redding (which I wasn't expecting). Mom makes these custom stocking for everyone, and Robin got one (I did expect Mom to make one, but not until next year.) And we had our "Thanksgiving-esque" Christmas Dinner, which I wasn't expecting either, but was very happy to get.

So, it was a very Christmas this year, all two of them.
