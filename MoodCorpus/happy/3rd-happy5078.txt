Merry Chrismakkah!
Woohoo! Christmakkah was lots of fun! I got bunches of cool stuff that I wanted including (but not limited to) a Keyboard (with stand), the Avenue Q Songbook (courtesy of Theresa), the Grimmerie (a behind-the-scenes look at Wicked, the musical), Wicked (the book), MacArthur Park (Richard Harris sings the songs of Jimmy Webb), locker magnets (oh, these should be fun), a Magic 8-Ball, Garden State, and a few other odds and ends of fun stuff. Woohoo! I love Chrismakkah!

I went onto Amazon.com today and bought some stuff with the money Aunt Annie sent me:

Y Tu Mama Tambien 
Cigarettes and Housework (Rachel Fuller)
Rent (1996 Original Broadway Cast Recording)
and a really nice journal for me to journal in (what else do you do with a journal? duh!)

Yeah, so today I cleaned and rearranged my room. I got tired of having the furniture in the same place (for three years!). So now everything's all funky, but I like it. I had to make room for the keyboard anyway. Matthew gave me his desk, so I got rid of the desk that was (literally) being held up by my old clarinet case (ooh! good use #1 for a clarinet!). I also purged a bunch of my shelves of stuff, so tomorrow I tackle my closets and head off to the dentist and Wal*Mart to get me a DVD player so I can watch my DVDs (woohoo!). And, for once, I'm not returning anything!

Uh, yeah, I miss y'all, but it's really nice accomplishing things at home. I swear. It is. ;)

Happy Boxing Day!

Oh yeah, and at some point or other I redid my layout... I don't remember when. Last week sometime. Which was when I resurrected my old insane clown icon. But now, I'm using my "So Old School" icon... which really doesn't serve a purpose other than being fun. :)
