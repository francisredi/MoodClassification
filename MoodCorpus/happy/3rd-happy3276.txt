god I can't get over it
Wasn't really planning to make this an LJ entry but I'm so damn excited about it that I simply must share. Recently with FFXI, there has been a PvP event entitled Ballista Royale. There were 2 parts to this tournament. 1st being the best among your own server, and the 2nd is the best of each server versus each other. My friends and I being as ballista obsessed as we are decided to form a team and enter this tournament. Don't want to boast myself or anything but I must say that we have alot, and I mean ALOT of experience with ballista in FFXI, so we had no doubts we would make it far in this tournament. Well, we were right. Tournament is not over yet, however we not only made the best team of our own server, but we are current among the TOP 4 teams out of ALL the FFXI servers. Assuming we win against the next team we play against (which again I don't mean to boast, but I have SO much fucking confidence in my team), we will be attending the FINAL FANTASY XI Fan Festival, displaying our final match LIVE. We would have to pay for our own transportation lodging and misc other expenses of course, although we do atleast get free entries into the festival :) For more information in regards to my team and the FINAL FANTASY XI Fan Festival, visit http://www.ffxifestival.com/ and http://na.square-enix.com/events/ffxi/ballista/2005/teamprofiles.html#pandemonium

As the second link shows, We are team Zing representing the Pandemonium server :) SO EXCITED~
