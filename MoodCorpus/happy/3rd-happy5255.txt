Tomorrow is Steve's B-day!!
Steve turns twenty tomorrow! How awesome is that?! Very!!! LoL Im excited for him. I hope he has a wonderful birthday! I know he will, only because he has too! So there! Im hope that I am able to spend about all day with him, but he must understand that I need to get some things done before I go running off. LoL... thats how my mom would say it. Crazy woman! OH well. 

Hopefully everyone had a splended Christmas, spent with loved ones and hopefully the Christmas cheer was spread around to all corners of the family. And yeah I hope everyone got at least one thing that they were really hoping to get. And yeah also stuffed their face full of the yummiest of foods and treats. LoL

I did pretty well this year. Got a lot of things that I wasnt expecting, so thats awesome. I got an electric keyboard, which is something that I never thought that I would get something like that. I also got a pair of these crazy boots, Im not sure if I really like them (who knows maybe they will grow on me)/ I also got a girft card to JCPenney's $100, so thats nice. I also got the coat that I really liked!!! So that was even cooler. And some slippers and a sweater, and some stuff for an apartment. And some other things. And Steve got me this really pretty bracelette. I like it a lot. I will wear it often! LoL.. no really I will. 

Well Im getting tired so I think that Im going to head on off of here and do some word finds or something of that nature. LoL. So laters!!!!!

~over and out~
