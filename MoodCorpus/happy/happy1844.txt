carols, carols and more carols
hey guys!

Tonight was the community carol sing at my church. I have to say it was really well organized and featured some very nice performances by the different choirs. The youth choir was quite possibly the cutest thing I have seen in awhile and the adults choirs were amazing as always. In the mens choir my dad was assigned to sing a descant. He (being the polite person he is) couldn't refuse and ended up pulling out an a flat! Way to go dad! Before the service he asked me to pray that he would hit it, and he did, with no problem! For you pmcers out there, you may remember deb and mike hopper. They did a duet with mike playing the drums and debbie signing. It sounded amazing!! May have been a little more enjoyable if I didn't have their son ryan screaming MOMMY!right beside me in the middle of the number, but it was still really good! The request section was as predictable as always...all the classics were called out. It was amazing how much sound came out of the church though, like it was a powerhouse. It was like people were feeding off of each other's sound because we all crescendoed (not a word, but whatever) at the same time and it was so cool! My friend Erynne (yes, yet another erin) and I got sooooo lost on one of the songs because we knew it a bit differently, we kept laughing and I felt bad because we were sitting at the very front and couldn't control our laughter. Overall it was a good time and acted as a perfect work break! Speaking of which I should probably get back on track. 

ciao!
