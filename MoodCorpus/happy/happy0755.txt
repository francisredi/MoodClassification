Day 31
This is just a piece of the rather long entry I made in my own entry today:

We are commanded to rejoice and be joyful. That suggests we have some control...is it of the actual dynamic of joy or just the clearing out of the debris in order to reveal and feel joy? I believe that is the completing of our joy of which Jesus speaks. (In my humble opinion, whenever we CHOOSE joy over discontent by determining through our own will power to be happy, rather than finding our joy in Christ/with Christ, it will be like a diet--we won't be able to continue on in our own power for long.) I like the idea of FINDING joy. It's there...go find it!

This is perfectly illustrated by a situation I had with Danica the other day. She had been at a friend's house and came home in a foul mood, which just got fouler as the evening progressed. We were supposed to be putting up Christmas decorations and she had been begging us to do it, but now didn't want to participate, was rude, snappy, withdrawn. I finally sent her to her room where she continued to sulk even though I tried to get her to talk. After awhile I left and we could hear her crying. I went back up and this time got her to talk. Her dilemma is one that I cannot solve...we live in an affluent area and her friends have every grown up thing you can imagine. Even if we could afford these things, I don't believe in 11 year olds having all these things. I told her I had no solution, then suggested we go finish the decorations. You wouldn't believe the change in her. Even without sugar she was happy, talking ninety-to-nothing, dancing, jumping, and did I mention talking???? I did nothing to make her happy...didn't promise her a cell phone or a lap top. I just provided an environment in which she could off-load the junk and find her natural joy.

Remember that joy is the highest worship of God (see Deut. 14:22-26)therefore it is a major target of Satan. The search for joy is a fight for joy!
