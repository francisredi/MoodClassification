I forgot how much I love this movie
I forget how much I love "The Sound of Music" until it's on ABC every year.  It has pretty much everything you could want in a movie... well.. I could want in a movie. There's music, there's a love story, there's action.  And the dad... like I know he's a dad, but come on, Christopher Plummer is hot for a father of seven. It's on now and this is my dilemma because not only is "The Sound of Music" on right now, but Home Alone, SVU, and the original Frosty the Snowman are on too. What to watch! I just keep flipping on commercials.  I love the holidays because so many of my old favorites are on.  Home Alone was made in 1990; I was 5.  And I'm almost 21 and I still love it. My friend said he couldn't talk online anymore because he had to focus on Home Alone.  One of the Petes from The Adventures of Pete and Pete is in it. Everything about this movie is a knock-knock.  (Knock knock is the term for anything that reminds you of the past.) 

I just flipped back to the Sound of Music and they're just about to get married. I LOVE this part. I like seeing them not afraid to be a couple.  Even though her dress covers about just about every part of her body, she still looks pretty. YAY this movie makes me so happy. :-) :-) They could pick a better song than "How do you solve a problem like Maria" for her to walk down the aisle to though. It seems to me that she's actually not a problem anymore. Call me crazy but I wouldn't want someone calling me a clown as I'm walking down the aisle. 

Tomorrow, Heather and I are going to see the UConn men's basketball team take on the UNH men's basketball team. I am scared.  I'm scared my team won't make it to double digits.  I didn't even think we were D-1, how did we end up playing the #2 team in the country?  Oy.
