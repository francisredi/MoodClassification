So I finally got my mage designed.  It makes me happy to see her on paper, even if she didnt work out quite the way I wanted her to.  Im hoping Cait will allow me to spend the first several months buying up things she would have had at the start if Id had more points to spend, such as Stamina (which really should be a 5, per the background) and Strength (needs to be at least one higher, same reason).   Ive got most of the background in my head, it just takes too long to type it, though I am getting it done piece by piece.  Im going to try to come in a life master, which I believe I can justify.  Im also enjoying my background tie-ins.  Scenes are fun, the last one was full of *drama*  hehe!   

It stinks that December crunches all the other games though.  Im really kind of bumming about not being able to really get to play my other characters.  Especially since I finally got back into 'ling, which I wass kind of blah about for a while.  Forsaken is back to being awsome, though the only reason it lagged was because we were unable to attend games and also because Dave had to get a transfer and not run as much stuff with me, which is the thing that keeps me interested in playing.  But he's sneaking some time, and so long as he doesnt get in trouble for talking to me, Im happy about it, as I am once more, getting to do stuff.
