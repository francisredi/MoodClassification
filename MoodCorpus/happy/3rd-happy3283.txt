More Music Madness
So today's musical finds, thanks once again to my cubicle mate, were Franz Ferdinand and The Futureheads.  Now I'm probably the last person in the universe to discover Franz Ferdinand, so I'll just let that one go by, but The Futureheads are apparently still relatively unknow, so here's the pimp.  Um, best descriptors would probably include quirky, odd, but also cool.  They're kind of a Punk/Thrash/Pop/Whatever kind of mix.  They sort of remind me of early Offspring, where you could have some of the most disturbing  lyrics, but the music around them was really catchy, guaranteed to make you feel the need to keep time with some part of your body... and get your minds out of the gutter, I wasn't talking about that.  And really, there's nothing sexy about this type of music, just fun.  

If there was nothing else to like about this group, the fact that they do a cover of Kate Bush's Hounds of Love is reason enough. ;)

Here's the link to one of their songs: Robot YSI link.

Lyric byte:
The best thing is our life span (i don't mind)
We last nigh on hundred years (i don't mind)
If that mean's we'll be together i dont mind (i have no mind)
The best things last a life time (i have no mind)
When you age i will not change (i have no mind)
I think i'll be around forever if you dont mind

I have no mind, why don't (i have no mind) (robot)
I have no mind, why don't (i have no mind) (robot)
I have no mind, why don't (i have no mind) (robot)
I have no mind, why don't (i have no mind)
