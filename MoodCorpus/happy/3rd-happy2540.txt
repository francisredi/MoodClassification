PHEW!
Today was long and very productive. So I got up at 9:30, which is early for a Sunday morning. This was okay, because at 10:30 Mom and Julia swung by and we went HOLIDAY SHOPPING!! Fa la la la la. La la. La LA! I got so much more done, and now I just need a couple more gifts that I am taking care of this week. Word. The Mall wasn't as crazy as I thought it was going to be, and I got a couple books for myself while I was there. One was called PLEDGED, which is about sorority life and how harsh it can be. A journalist went undercover as a college student and wrote a book. Julia is borrowing it for now, though, and all I have to say is that she had better be a fast reader. The other book I got, which was much more amusing, is called MAKE LOVE THE BRUCE CAMPBELL WAY!!! Holy. SHIT. It's so funny thus far. It's a fictional account of how he got a movie role in a big A Movie instead of a B Movie. He's hilarious. 

Tonight, I saw a few people. For one, Justin was over, which was nice because Justin is AWESOME!! He has a 20 foot long scarf. WOW. And then, of course, Tom and Jeff came over and we had fun like always. We played MELEE and all that jazz. They won't be here for a couple weeks. One reason is Christmas. The other is Jeff is going West. Sad day. 

Julia and I watched HOME ALONE today.Instead of laughing at the horrors befalling the burglars, we were just yelling "OWWIE!" It's just painful. Liz and I made coffee plans, so that's taken care of as well. Tuesday night, 6:30. w00t. Now I'm going off to read my new book. And maybe do some dishes.
