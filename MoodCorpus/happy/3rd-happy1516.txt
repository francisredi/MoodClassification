friday AND saturday?!
Amazing night number 2.&nbsp;*squee*

I spent today shopping and cookie making, and courtesy of the wonderful &nbsp;I had an wonderful recipe and yummy yummy&nbsp;cookies that I made with the help of . And when I was shopping I found powdered Ghirdelli chocolate and had&nbsp;regular chocolate frosting and orange-flavored chocolate frosting :)

Tonight was Hillary's birthday/Chanukkah party. Dinner at Mimi's in Dupont,&nbsp;which was fun fun fun and I met new people.&nbsp;We then went back to southside where we exchanged gifts and hung out a bit. (I now have magnetic poetry pick up lines courtesy of Hillary, an&nbsp;Orlando Bloom calendar from&nbsp;Robyn, and mint chocolates from Scott.) Hillary, Scott, Joe,&nbsp;Elliot, and I wound up in Joe's room watching&nbsp;the first season of Duck Tales and figuring out which of the boys was which&nbsp;duck, as the three of them are practically inseperable. 'Twas much fun. Of course, then we realized it was almost 2 in the morning, so Elliot and I walked back to&nbsp;north side. He can be a real sweetie when he wants to be. Walked me back to my room.

Highlight:&nbsp;People had gone to&nbsp;fetch things from various rooms. I'm in Joe's and I hear giggling so I go outside. Hillary, Joe,&nbsp;and Elliot are dying in the hallway and Hil drags me down the hall to hear male moaning coming from the girl's room. We giggle and run back to Joe's, where Elliot says he's going to go stand on a toilet to look over, we follow. Joe's uber-conservative roommate and his girlfriend come out of the bathroom. Hillary falls down laughing and Elliot and I run away, collapsing on each other. We all go back to Joe's room and die.


I'm thrilled to be going home. I want to see Amy and Erica and Gabi and my family and recouperate and just be home. But at the same time... I'm sooo gonna miss DC. I'm not convinced I'll make it almost a month at home...
