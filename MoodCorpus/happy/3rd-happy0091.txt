All Finished
Finished for the semester! It is a great feeling. I turned in two papers yesterday and read for the final class in my Barth discussion class. This morning I worked for 1.5 hours and showered and am ready to relax. I am going to try to get my Christmas letter compiled and sent out before I head home. I also would like to get a little head start on the coming semester.

I will most likely need to do some studying over the Christmas break - I have a directed study that I haven't so much worked on this semester. I will like to finish things up on that as soon as I can.

Classes for next semester are:
The Body in Theology - Consortium class at Catholic University of America - This course surveys theological reflection concerning the significance of the body, its relation to the person, and its sexual dimension in the Christian tradition. Select patristic, medieval, and modern sources will guide the examination of both continuity and development in thought concerning the body. 

Seminar: Christology - The doctrine of the person and work of Jesus Christ in contemporary Protestant and Roman Catholic theology.

Ethical Dimensions of Ministry - The dimensions of ministry involving moral teaching, counsel, and mediation of moral conflicts, along with moral challenges raised by the practice of ministry (e.g., confidentiality and boundary setting).

Early Christian Communities - Development of the history and thought of early Christian communities; examination of movements, figures, practices and teachings with focus on primary sources.

I'll only have class on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, which will be quite nice.
