La la la laaaa  Almost Christmas!
Man i am sooo excited!!.  I dunno what it is about this time of year but i get all happy and "giddy" if you will.  Happy Happy Happy!!.  This and also cause i'm off to Ottawa tomorrow YAY!!.  I've finally got everything done that i needed to get done with the exception of a few things i need to get tomorrow.  I finally got the tree decorated with my mother today so shes all happy about that.  Theeennn i got my "ride" situation figured out.  I'm nooowww taking the bus from Espanola into Sudbury at 10:40, getting there with enough time for me to have some cigs and coffee before my other bus shows up at 12:30.  Then i can sit back and relax 'till i get there.  Woo hoo!!.  Ahh and my other mother was a sweetheart today and offered to pick me up and bring me home on the 21st.  And she lent me her sweet ass suit case.  Yeah cause mine sucks and well hers is just better haha.  I guess theres really nothing left for me to do now, like i got my laundry and all that done, now i just have to run to the drug store tomorrow and pick a few things up and then come home and pack for the trip.  Annddd sit around for the remainder of the day.  This works out so well now that i don't have to get a ride in with anyone.  I mean it would be better if i could get a ride in at night so i don't have to sit on the bus again but whatever its better then the alternative.  Which will remain nameless hahaha.  Anywho, i should finish up my wrapping.  
To everyone i won't see over the holidays, MERRY CHRISTMAS love ya all, and hopfully i'll see yas before the New Year.    PaRtY for New Years Eve!!  plans are made. lol.
