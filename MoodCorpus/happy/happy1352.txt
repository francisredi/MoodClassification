christmas time!
ok now its december its cristmas time i can accept that. but what is unacceptable is the idea of calling a christmas tree anything other than a christmas tree. a "holiday" tree? give me a break! christmas is a christian holiday, yes folks you can say it, jesus christ. now i know that he most likely wasnt born on the 25th of december but that was around 2000 years ago and they had to get the pagans into the christian church somehow so moving the festival of his birth to coincide with the festival of the winter solstice is alright. now back to topic. when is politically correct going to far? not everyone celebrates christmas, not everyone has to. in the USA we can worship dog if we want its out choice. we who consider ourselves christian accept other peoples faiths as validly as our own we are an open people (except the catholics but theyre learning) you can worship whoever and celebrate when ever and you can tread on me cause im a christian "WWJD" the guy was nailed to a cross cause he didnt want to tell some bigwiggs to fuck off an leave him alone he didnt talk he just took it like a man. he knew that winning people over isnt about how much noise you can make is how much noise you dont make. now me talking about this is kind of contradicting myself because "hey if it doesnt matter why are you talking about it?" well someone has to.  Christmas isnt about "things" life shouldnt be about "things" christmas is about feeling and its cold outside so feeling is a good thing. what christmas means to me is how we should act all year everyones smiling everyone seems happy more people hold open doors and are more curtious around christmas time, not because santas watching but because its whats right. were givin a chance every year to redeem ourselves and make a new start. its christmas. deal with it. i cant wait to get my CHRISTMAS TREE!!!!!!
