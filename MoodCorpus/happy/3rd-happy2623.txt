WINTER BREAK
GOD BLESS AMERICA! WINTER BREAK IS HERE BABY! Finally we all get a break and time to actually relax, i thought this time would never come. I may be doing really bad in Physics and Spanish but its all good i just have to execute a lil better on finals and ill still come out ahead. The assembly today was a bit dissapointing but i understand why they needed the entire school there and why it was a secret. They just didnt want her to find out and the newscrew needed it to look good so we all had to be there cheering. But don't you fear, i have a plan. I'm going to write an email to Oprah and tell her what happen and maybe she'll really come and visit us. It's wishful thinking however it's worth a try. So dont lose faith guys Oprah may still be coming to Richwoods. (but forget Dr. Phil cause if he came he'd prolly lecture half the people at our school) Oh and biology was a gag we def had an indepth josh/jin discussion which was hilarious. I didnt update last week but in history we do study areas and the presenter provides an activity for the group. Well Charley had some activity called Conquest and it was like a board game and he needed 3 group leaders. So Calvin volunteers and he tosses him the gamepieces and goes "you're the giants" then mena "your tribe was called the injuvits" then i volunteered for the last one and he tosses me the bag of m&amp;ms which are the gamepieces and i have to stretch to catch his weird toss then the second i caught it he says "uhhh... and narmar... urs were nicknamed small and shriveled" and the whole class laughed. It was funny but since charley said it it made it worse. Mrs Schultz even llaughed. Now im just chillin watchin TV//reading Phil Jackson's book. Nothin' is goin on 2nite so im just chillin. Tomorrow im prolly gonna go get a haircut then go to the malll, BUT I HAVE TO CLEAN MY ROOM or my mom's prolly gonna kill me.
