Adventures In Volunteering
'Tis the season of charities and capitalism. So when I haven't been spending money as fast as I make it, I've been volunteering for various worthy causes.
Breakfast With Santa: It's a Good Thing I'm an Overgrown Child
In all honesty, I was dreading this event. I was in charge of the craft area for 200+ kiddies. I hate kids and I don't do crafts; but I survived. I even managed to enjoy myself. I decided to take an "if you can't beat 'em, join 'em" approach". This meant getting covered in glitter, wearing a blinky pink santa hat, having my face painted, and making Christmas ornaments. There was one screaming&nbsp;toddler incident, but its mother took it out of the room before it got too bad. Aside from that, the kids were polite and well-behaved. It's not&nbsp;something&nbsp;I want&nbsp;to do every day; but once a year is acceptable.
Ringing&nbsp;the Salvation Army Bell, Or Being Hit on for a Good Cause
Now this was not what I expected at all. Mostly because I spent an hour getting ogled and hit on by men aged 20-80 for the sake of a Christian charity. One, who was kinda cute, told me I was a cutie. And then there was the redneck who told me I was "the purdiest one [bell-ringer]&nbsp;they've had out here [in front of the grocery store]". Ugh. Oh, and there were a couple guys who tried to tip me, as in one dollar for the kettle and one for me. Needless to say, my&nbsp;"tips" went into the kettle. But it&nbsp;did get me out of the office and amuse&nbsp;me for an hour on a slow Friday afternoon.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Teehee. The things I do in the name of "networking". Though if I'm going to volunteer, I'd rather get involved with a group teaching English to Spanish-speakers or one designed to help&nbsp;Hispanic migrant workers. Hopefully this summer, I won't lose my job. Then&nbsp;I'll have time to spend working with such a group.
