WOW!
Talk about a roller coaster!
 so last night after i got off, i sat down and watched the best movie ever: "It's a Wonderful Life"! I love that movie! Sept, it seemed like last night hit me more than usual. I was so happy after that movie (like always), except this time, i had tears of joy in my eyes. i felt so good! And then the advent candle this week was JOy! and the sermon was like: OMFG, I want toMArry this man! (j/k!)! Why does it seem like everything in the media (including church) always seem to reflect my life?! its soo wierd!
  Then, after shurch, i worked on my boring, stupid ugly lab report (got a headache) balanced everything, then made it pertty! :) I love! Then i got to see my sister (she's here right now) and, yeah, im really happy right now. PARTY AT THE WHITE HOUSE (there'll be a christmas tree! lol im not being p.c!)! See ya guys. oh and i never meant to get involved with the flutes, i agree with Kayla, its ok to sound good, but that should not take precedence over FUN at pep band. If we're not having fun, then the rest of the crowd will be kinda blaze`! Don't believe me? ask them, or even just go to a game w/out us. not as fun. so yeah. keep leaving lotsa comments. i like feedback.
