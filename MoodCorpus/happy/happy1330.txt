493 entries, 365 days. It is SOOO exciting.
Happy Birthday Wispra's Livejournal!!!
We've made it through a year of love, loss, happiness, pain, dancing, and injuries, and I must say---we've done a GREAT job. We're at 494 entries, so there will be another celebration in a day or so when I reach 500. GOSH, THAT IS SO EXCITING.
So, more or less, I'm more tired than I would think it is possible to be (even though right now I'm bouncing around in my chair to the sounds of "speed of sound" which I'm humming) so I guess I'm not THAT&nbsp; tired.
The dance competition was TODAY, and we had a lot of fun. I promise to update in more detail when I have more time. Right now, I feel like icing my knee and sleeping for about eight hours. Since Rowan is coming over tomorrow, and we're gonna hang out, I won't be able to sleep the dream of abour 20 hours. Oh well. That wouldn't happen anyway. Since I live off of like two hours a day.
I can't believe it has been a whole year of writing in this livejournal. So much has changed, from the overall content of the journal entries, to the style of my journal, my little icon, and the friends who read. Everything went through hard spots, but I came through stronger than ever. I mean, some things definitely gave me trouble, but I prevailed in the end, surpassed all obstacles, and lived to tell the tale. In my opinion, that calls for applause.
So, wish Wispra and her livejournal a happy happy celebration of a whole year of joyful union. 
There's a party goin' on right here...A celebration to last throughout the years...So bring your good times, and your laughter too...We gonna celebrate your party with you...
Let's all celebrate and have a good time!!
