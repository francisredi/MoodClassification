WOW!
Oh my goodness! 

Rachel Jennings, Alisa, Amma, Tricica! You know how long I haven't seen these people?!?!? And they all look so good- and so grown! LOL The only person I can't remember is Saphire? Was she in our year group? Did she leave Bahs early? Hmm!

And where ARE their posts anyway, I'm sure they know about this site!

On another note, La Toya Gyul, you know what I remembered? Remember when we had to make up jingles for Ms. Bacchus-Ifil's music class in form 1? "ooooo wooooo Red Rose Tea. Ooooooo oooooo Red, Rose, Tea!

I can just sse us twirling to the "music"- Kymberlee, Ayanna Smart, you, me, and after that the names get a bit fuzzy. But it's fun to remember nevertheless.

P.S Congratulations La Toya! I knew you'd knock their socks off! And perfect pitch?!?! You must be much better than I thought? You go girl. And another thing, why are you so anxious to move to somewhere cold, eh? I hate the heat too, prefer the cold, but I definitely hate the icy rain, sleet, extremely slick roads that turn driving into ice-skating in wheels! Talk about accidents! But WHEN you move to Boston, you'll experience this sooner or later. :)
