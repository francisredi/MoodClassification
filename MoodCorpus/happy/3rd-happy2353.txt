Staff Party!
Oh my, i had the MOST fun last night at hte staff do.. Because we work at a pub its free drinks, free food and loads of great people. last year i felt a little outta place as tehre was no one my age and such and i remember i left early. This year was a TAD different.
When we got there i hung around with my girls in the kitchen and their kids and just had a ball. After we ate i went over and kinda started talking to one of the chef's boyfriend's brother. He is the same age as me and i have worked with him once buit he seemed like a really nice guy. Danielle (the chef) had told me that he had had a lot of problems, being depressed and not being able to make friends easily so i set about as my mission to make him feel welcome (no going to the gutter there either people!) and being nice and friendly. It turned out that he is really lovely company and as we drank *giggles* and sung and all that we had a real ball! He ended up being a lot of fun and the fact he was MY age was fantastic because there is usualyl only people younger or older than me so i had a fantastic time. I woke up this morning feeling fine... though very tired and really happy that i met someone lovely and fun. I am gonna see him again on new years i think and i personally can't wait :) he was so much fun!
I havent had fun with a guy for AGES! So it was a nice change of pace
Anywhos i just had to get all that down!
