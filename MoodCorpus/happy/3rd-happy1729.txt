Update
The past couple of days have been... well... a lot of fun!  On Friday, I went to the Humane Society yet again, and I adopted a second cat :3  His name is Boscoe!  He's about 9 months old and very petite-- only a little bigger than Bijou.   And he's spotted XD  He's adorable.  Bijou and him have been chasing each other all around the apartment this morning and all last night... crazy cats.  I'm glad they like each other.  I'll have to post pictures later!

Yesterday, I went down to the good ol' M'ville and went to Matt O's Christmas party.  I saw a bunch of people I hadn't seen since high school.  There was a lot of good food, too ^^  It was a lot of fun!  It was really good to see Matt again, feels like it's been ages.  I also discovered that an old friend from marching band goes to UT, so we decided to meet up once he comes back up!  Man... I laughed so hard at that party my face was hurting all the way home.  I haven't laughed like that in a long time.  

And tomorrow... I'm going to see an advance screening of "Memoirs of a Geisha," cause I won passes in a contest :D  I never win anything, how exciting!  It's gonna be shown in this huge theater in Toledo, woohoo!  Yay for comfty seats.  

Today, I think Karl and I are going to try to make some cookies.  I hope they turn out ok, especially since Boscoe was dead set on "helping" me make breakfast this morning *roll eyes*  Bijou isn't big enough to jump on the counter yet, but Boscoe is and he does.  

BTW, Trace, Aya and whoever else in M'ville-- I'll be back on Wednesday evening, it seems, and I'll stay through Christmas or the next day (I think).  That's the plan for now!
