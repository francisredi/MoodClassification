Ceroc Christmas Party
I had a good night on Saturday.  It was the Christmas party for people who go to Ceroc Canberra, and a group of us had dinner beforehand at Antigo's.

A few of the women got dressed up (like you do for a Christmas party) and were looking stunning.  One of them said that my jaw dropped when they entered the room, so that gives you an indication.  We had a good meal (4 of us had chicken, because I'm a trend setter :) ), listened to the waiter (poor guy was trying to draw us into a conversation but was getting no help from our end) and basically had a good time.
At the party they started a 'competition', where everyone got a gold sticker.  As long as you kept dancing you got to keep your sticker, but if you sat down (outside of specified 'rest' periods) you had your sticker revoked.  After a few hours, everyone who still had their sticker got to put their name into a hat (which looked surprisingly like a bowl) for some prizes.
This would have been a great idea if someone had told me beforehand - because I had been expecting to be able to take regular 'cool down' breaks, I only brought 2 shirts... and the first one was drenched in sweat early on in the piece.  Luckily the second shirt was a lighter material and while still wet wasn't so bad.
There was also a mini-workshop of close moves consisting of 3 combos, which I was able to pursuade Jules to do with me :)  Now, I just need to practice them...
I took a few photos too, which may or may not be put up depending on demand.
