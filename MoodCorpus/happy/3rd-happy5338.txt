It's all about ME.
...ME as in Maine.  Which is where we went today.

Hubby keeps an online blog that's mostly political commentary, and some personal stuff.  His political views differ quite a bit from mine, so I don't participate for the most part.  One of his favorite bloggers of late is a woman who keeps her own conservative blog called neo-neocon, and we went up to Maine to visit her today.

The trip in itself was an adventure.  It rained all the way up and back - everything from a little drizzle to full-on downpour, and the biting wind made it darned uncomfortable getting out of the car.

I've lived in the west for many years, and I sometimes forget that the states here in the east are a little more... compact.  We crossed the New Hampshire border SIX times during the trip.  Nashua is very close to the MA border, so our easiest route took us just south enough to touch it on the way there and back.  So the route took us from NH to Mass. to NH to Maine to NH to Mass. and back to NH.  While in Portland, neo-neocon took us around to see some of the sights of Portland, and I got a couple pictures of the Portland Head lighthouse.  If the weather had been nicer, I could have gotten some better ones, but I just wasn't willing to spend any more time than absolutely necessary out in that @#$%^& wind and rain.

We had lunch in an upscale cafe in Portland.  At least I HOPE it's an upscale cafe with the prices that were on the menu.  I had the sandwich and soup combo (grilled cheddar and tomato soup) for about $12, and if those are representative of eating out prices there, I don't know how anyone affords it.

The trip back was uneventful, and I finished out the day by getting my butt kicked at Phase 10 by my younger sister.  Tomorrow, we start trying to find all the stuff that's spread all over the house and pack it up in suitcases light enough to not trip overage scale at the airport.  It's been a fun week, but I'll be glad to get home again.
