It's a good feeling.....
I just paid all the bills, up to January 3rd, including the mortgage and the credit cards. Next payment that is due will be another credit card on 1/6/06.  And there is still a bit of money still in the checking account...and we'll still be getting 3 more paychecks this month (CJ is paid weekly, and it's a 5 check month for him, I'm paid bi-weekly and it's a 3 check month for me) plus my quarterly bonus and the year-end bonus for me also.  Only other expense for this month is the $300 to the sitter on my next payday (Friday of Christmas week) and allowance/lunch moneys for the remaining 2 weeks of the year.  Plans are to sock away at least $500, or more, of the extra paycheck, more if we can, and make an extra payment on one of the debts.  I think we finally have our feet under us financially, and, so long as CJ stays employed and continues to earn approximately what he is now, we will be on-track for nearly debt free in 3-4 years (mortgage and home equity line of credit only....maybe a car payment....depends on how much longer the 1996 Saturn holds out).  I think this is the first month in about a year or two that I've been able to pay the mortgage more than a week before the end of the month, and have a positive balance on the checking account without increasing the credit card balances.

It's a good feeling, and I sincerely hope my friends have the chance to experience this feeling as well.  There's still a long road, with a delicate balance to maintain, but at least I know there's a light now.
