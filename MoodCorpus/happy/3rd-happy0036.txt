I'm in Love...
... with a "new" music artist: Thea Gilmore. 

Last month, we got a copy of her album Songs from the Gutter as part of our in-store play roster. It quickly became one of my favorite selections, an album I put on almost every shift I work - not only because I am beyond sick of Christmas music but because I truly love the album. After Sooj made comments about liking some of the songs on the album, I decided to purchase a few cuts on itunes. Discovering that Thea has several albums to her credit, I've been adding them to my collection. Money's been tight, so I've only bought a few so far - but DAMN! They're all on my heavy-rotation list these days. 

Why haven't more people heard of her? 

Yes, I have a new favorite artist to add to my (rather extensive) collection. Her name is Thea Gilmore, and for anyone who loves gut-level rock/folk/blues/punk synergies, she's the real deal. Ranging from the harsh Neil Youngisms of "When Did You Get so Safe?" to the trippy acoustic flow of "Into the Blue," the melancholic reflections of "The Old Laughing Lady" to her truly-fucking-lovely cover of the Buzzcocks' "Ever Fallen in Love," this Irish songstress has the goods in a very big way. I'm amazed that I hadn't heard of her until recently (she's been recording since 1998), but I'm glad to know about her now. 

Check her out and spread the word. This one's for real! 

PS: Also, Faith and the Muse are now available on itunes as well. If you've been intrigued by what you've heard or read about them from me, now's the time to check 'em out! 

Off to work now. Blessings!
