Dance, misery loves me ...
Quick dashing thing. (It was a freezingcold day: one of those days when one walks through puddles at 4:00 and slips on the ice at 5:00.)

Will probably gone for much of the next week -- those of you who know where I live, I will not be there. Will be at Sonja's and subsequently in Canada and then back (and presumably practice piano at both locals so Annie does not find reason to kill me again).

Am in the process of trying to figure out how to pack manymany things, finish manymany cards, and do manymany articles of homework (hello, Physics homework, goodbye, Physics grade) before 2:00 to-morrow. 

Have been incapable of waking up to alarm clock on school days of late, let alone week-ends, but will endeavour in a manly manner to do so.

And. And. Andandand. I found my speakers. My mother guessed their location -- the attic -- and I retrieved them and hooked them up and experienced a Ferre!Gasm when I turned them on and played things. It was joygasmic. (Kind of like when what I am now going to call the Jehanturne plays well.)

Against the very real possibility that I am not around for Christmas itself:

MERRY CHRISTMAS.

I love you all, so veryvery much.

This also means that anything I owe people for Christmas might, er, not be around until after Christmas. *winces* Sorry.
