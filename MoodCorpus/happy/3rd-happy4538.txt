Aja's Xmas special!
Wow finally a good christmas. ^_^ its so incredible how much gary's parents treated me this year. I got like a whole bunch of cute little gifts and a few really nice ones. Like of the cute little gifts i got chocolate coins, which i love cause they're kewl ^_^, these little wind up toys that gary, me, and his sister were all violently racing around the living room lol, uhm what else? OH candles! i love candles, and butterfingers and stuff i forget what else was in the stocking. And then gary's mom got me these gift packs from bath and body works with 3 body sprays and 3 lotions, a giant tub of those carmel, cheese, and buttered popcorn tins, uhm OH a first aid kit thing cause i always hurt myself at work, a really nice kitchen set, and this AWESOMELY soft blankey that i havent stopped carrying with me since i got it lol. And then from gary my love i finally got the matching beenie baby to my dragon pearl (magic). You know the brown one with the red wings called Scortch. I FINALLY GOT IT ^___^  I was so happy i couldnt stop smiling. 

That night we stayed up till 5 in the morning watching anime, eating popcorn, and drinking hot cocoa. After only managing to get 4 hours sleep the aja was very happy when the gary finally layed down with her and put her to bed ^_^  Next day we didnt get up till 2 in the afternoon except for the short awakening from mom when she called at noon to say merry xmas and dad told me my ipod should be coming soon in the mail ^_____^ Oh and xmas dinner was so good, gary's dad is a good cook so the ham was so juicy that I actually liked it, a lot! I even brought some home lol. The actually day of Xmas was spent pretty much lounging around, eating, sleeping, and playing lots of video games ^_^ I even got a day off from my land lady who wasnt home today. So when gary finally got back to my place at 9ish he and i had a nice xmas of our own alone together and carefree. *sigh*  its been a good xmas and the only thing is that i wish i could have seen kalise for a bit too, but im not sure where she was for xmas (i think with her mom?) Anyway....

I hope everyone else had a good xmas too, AIM, Messenger, or email me about it when you can update me on ur xmas's k? Ttyl i gotta go to bed
