Tutto sembrea migliore, alla luce que varra dal sole.  Questa notte passera...
Everything will seem better
Under the light that will come from the sun.
This night will pass--

Okay, that is a translation of the lyrics in the title for&nbsp;the song of the day for today, for those who were looking.&nbsp; 

Today was an okay day.&nbsp; I got to relax some, and I got to write a bit of "Cast No Shadow," the essay I'm working on now that "A Modest Proposal" is done.&nbsp; It's going to have a lot of appendices giving the biblical background so that the paper can focus on the implications of the rather dark stories.&nbsp; At any rate, I had plenty to do at work today, as I got 5 plans ready for George (we'll see when he comes this week, because even if I'm the only one who has plans for him he should still be busy sealing and signing for a few hours).&nbsp; I'm currently trying to read a book on the Venetian Empire and keep track of the scores on the first college bowl of the season, the New Orleans Bowl (played, implausibly enough this year, in Lafayette, by a team that was here last year (Southern Miss) and a team that has not been to a bowl game since 1970 (Arkansas State)).&nbsp; I love college bowl season.

Anyways, my fantasy teams both got slaughtered last week, but that's okay.&nbsp; There's still Premier League (that would be the English soccer league, for those who don't know) fantasy football (albeit not the American kind) to look forward to...
