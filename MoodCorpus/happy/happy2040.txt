Night out
Well, I was having a horrible day after chemistry today, but Breann and Manmeet and I decided we needed to go relieve stress, so we went to the mall/dinner/a movie. It was so much fun! We saw Aeonflux. It took a while to get into it, but by the end we all loved it. The mall was fun too, we just roamed around. OH! And then we took pictures in one of those booth things! It's great. Then I was hit on by a guy. Well, he had his friend do it. He was like "hey girl in the lavender jacket, my friend wants your number." i was like 0.0. ahhhhhhhhh...then i'm like "i don't think so, sorry." he's like "i got lots of money, i practically own this store" (they were standing outside some gangster/sweatshirt/sports/hats/something store). But it was horrible because we had to wait a whole minute for our pictures to come out of the thing so we were just like OH GEEZ. We couldn't leave! Then when they finally came out we were like WALK AWAY! FAST! lol. It was fun, though. I guess it helps my self-image/confidence. Breann and I talked for over an hour in my driveway afterwards. It was fun. I've needed to talk to someone for a long time. I'd missed her while she was in Georgia this past week. It's also good to know I'm not the only person struggling in Chemistry. Well, it's late and I'm babysitting at 8 tomorrow morning. And again at 5:30. Happy snow day!
