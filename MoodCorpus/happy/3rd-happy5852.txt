dream a little dream for me
Oh boy.&nbsp; On a lighter note, I had the MOST amazing dream -- and I better write it down before I forget it forever.&nbsp; Alright, in the dream I was playing a video game.&nbsp; The most supremely amazing video game!&nbsp; 
Okay, it starts off and you are a woman agent of some kind.&nbsp; And there are these assasination droids that are assigned to kill only one person and when they find you they just hold on to your shoulders and self-destruct.&nbsp; BAM!&nbsp; Dead.&nbsp; So, as this female agent, you are in a really cool spaceship (on a planet, not in space) and you see the droid that has come for you.&nbsp; There's nothing you can do, man!&nbsp; Nothing!&nbsp; So it grabs you and BAM!
Then you switch to playing a male operative.&nbsp; The female's old partner.&nbsp; You find parts of the spaceship and realize what happened.&nbsp; You do a little digging and find out that Supreme Chancellor Palpatine is behind the assasination!&nbsp; That's right, it's a Star Wars dream.&nbsp; Oh man!&nbsp; So, you turn rogue, abandon your station and infiltrate the Chancellor's house.&nbsp; It's huge by the way.&nbsp; He's on the top level and you come in on the bottom.&nbsp; And you pretty much have to kill everything in your way.&nbsp; You have this AMAZING blaster, though, and most of the guards are inept (especially on the lower floors) -- that's right, in my dreams video games are easy so I can feel superior.&nbsp; 
And, get this: in the multi-player version of the game you put on this super cool helmet and get a light saber.&nbsp; I beat Brad's ass in the dream.&nbsp; Me and my helmet.&nbsp; My light saber was green though.&nbsp; Strange.&nbsp; I'm usually a blue or purple light saber kind of girl myself...&nbsp;
