yesterday...
Yesterday was wonderful...Josh came over and stayed all day and we exchanged Christmas presents.  He and his parents gave me a beautiful strand of pearls and Josh gave me a jewelry box with my new initials (as of July) engraved on them.  L's are so much prettier than H's.  Then we made sugar cookies shaped like gingerbread men and decorated them and then we fixed some stuff on our registry and he helped me with my resume and then we went and picked up Chick file (I apparently can't spell that right now) and watched it's a wonderful life which I am convinced is about the best movie in the world.  Then Josh cleaned alot of my jewelry and we put it in my new jewelry box. 

I am excited about today being Christmas eve too.  We had cinnamon rolls for breakfast and in a little while I am going to church with my mom and I'm going to play the piano in the parish hall while she practices the organ for tonight.  Tonight we have church at 4:30, then we come home and have dinner (Christmas pasta, salad with mandarin oranges, dried cranberries, and almonds on it, and bread dipped in olive oil and spices) Then Josh is coming over around 9:30 to open his presents from my parents and then he's going to the 11PM service with us (which means i'll have someone to sit with in church, yay!).  

Tommorrow we'll open presents, have pancakes, and then go to church.  The Christmas day service is my favorite one of the whole year.  It's very simple.  Usually just a few people are there and Mama just plays the piano downstairs instead of sitting up in the balcony and instead of a sermon people can request Christmas hymns and we sing a bunch of them.  and Everyone can bring a new gift and Daddys blesses them (or more accurately, the relationship they represent).  I love Christmas and my family's Christmas traditions.
