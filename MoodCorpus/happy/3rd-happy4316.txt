Happy Christmas
Hurrah for Christmas.  Woke up thismorning rather too early given that I didn't get to sleep till 2a.m. due to midnight mass.  However, Father Christmas had been by and obviously I have been good as there was a stocking mostly filled with yummy chocolate.  Chocolate coins for breakfast made me feel much better.  Gentle and relaxed morning while we waited for brother-in-law and his wife (sister-in-law-in-law?) to arrive, punctuated by telephone call home to my sisters and parents who seemed to have calmed down drmamtically compared to how stressed they all were when I spoke to them yesterday.  I think it's opening the champagne at 10:30am that helps.  Thus reminded, I mentioned the champagne downstairs and it was not long before I had my own supply.  Aformentioned arrivals arrived and we had an orgy of present-unwrapping and a delicious christmas meal with utterly splendid roast potatos & honey roast parsnips and all sorts of fantastic other roast veg which mu mother-in-law is absolutely fantastic at making (mine are never as good) supplementing the rather delicious quorn roast with 3 sorts of stuffing etc etc...  Sadly I wasn't able to pig out in an orgy of indulgence as my tummy is now just incapable of the same volumes it has been in previous years.  I couldn't help feeling short-changed, deprived even, but I'm glad I did refuse seconds as P. chose to go ahead and was distinctly uncomfortable afterwards... Post parandial debate about The State This Country Is In, and of course The Youth Of Today and naturally Why The Left Wing Have It All Wrong which was great fun.  Now looking forward to the New Dr Who!!! 18 minutes and counting...
