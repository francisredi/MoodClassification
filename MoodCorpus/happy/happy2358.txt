the culmination of my Brown career
I just witnessed it firsthand, after years of hearing tales... the NAKED DONUT RUN!

Yes, I just said naked donut run.  Or rather, typed it.

No, I am not hallucinating because I've spent too much time in the library (at least, I'm not hallucinating about this).

Every semester, at midnight the night before finals, a big group of people runs around the two main libraries naked, handing out donuts.  As I'd never actually experienced this (since I tend to study anywhere that's not the Brown libraries), I decided that this year I had to make sure I saw it.  And I did.  I've been working at my carrel (the one space in the library where I actually seem to consistently get stuff done - tonight being an obvious exception), but it's sort of in a corner with no one else near, so as midnight approached I decided to venture into the more-populated computer lab.  I was sitting at a computer chatting with Geoff D'Cruz, when I happened to glance behind me, and come face to... er, genitals... with lots of naked bodies.  Yay!  Then I got a piece of donut, and they all moved off en masse.

It turns out the room where they all got undressed and redressed is actually very near my carrel, so on my return I witnessed a few stragglers moving very hurriedly toward their clothing.

In all, quite satisfactory.  Now I can graduate.
