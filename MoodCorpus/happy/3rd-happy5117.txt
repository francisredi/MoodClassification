aaaaahhhhhh  (sense of relief)
I'm not quite sure if that is spelled right, but the point still remains, i feel so peaceful right now.  I finished my book today.  "Dinner with a Perfect Stranger" is an amazing book.  I feel so uplifted now.  God rocks, He really does!!!!!  

I think i'm pretty excited to go back to school too.  This will be the first time going into that building without a girlfriend.  I think i'm really going to enjoy it.  I hope that doesn't make me a bad person.  I thank everyone who has helped me through this rough patch.  You all mean more to me than words can express.  Kelsey and Lousie especially.  Thank you for the venting sessions.  Everyone else, thank you for all your kind words and thoughts and prayers for all this.  I feel so good now and it's because of the love i recive from all my friends.  You all mean so much to me.  If there is anything i can do to repay you guys please don't hessitate to ask.  

I listended to 2 of my 5 new Aerosmith CDs today and they are so cool.  There is this one song that just spoke to me.  It's entitled Amazing and it sang about letting go from a very deep relationship and how you can't live a lie any more.  That was the power of God speaking to me; I know it!!!!!  He has helped me so much too.  I think i might have mentioned that though.   

This feeling is so wonderful.  I wish I had this a long time ago.  

Oh, Kelsey, what do you want to do tomorrow, if you can/want to do anything?  

God Bless all of you!!!!!!!!  I wish this feeling on everybody.  May you have a wonderful New Years and enjoy your extra second of 2005!!!! :)
