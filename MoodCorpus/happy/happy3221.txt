oh what a night
ok so let me just tell you that last night was frickin RIDICULOUS. so, we went out and had some fun sake bombing with the asian cooks at the place we went to. then we came back and at this point we were all pretty intoxicated. then me and courtney decide that some extracurricular activity was in order, so we went with dave to acheive our goal. so needless to say i was pretty out of it by then. we hung out with the guys for a while and decided to go back and sleep cause it had been a pretty great night and nothing could top that right?
wrong
i was dead asleep and i hear patch come into my room, and he tell all of us that we have to get up right now. and i hear the fire alarm going off. i was still wicked out of it, so i was digging through all of the shit on my floor for a bra and some shoes when alex comes barreling into the room and starts screaminig at us to hurry the fuck up. at this point i have one shoe on and no bra, but she was so panicked that i bolted out of the room, grabbing a random jacket on my way out, breaking a coat hanger in the process. so here's me in my roommates nice brown jacket, pink pj pants and one shoe. i run out of the room and take the corner but slip and fall flat on my face because there it a light dusting of fire extiguisher powder all over the hallway. i pick myself up and get blasted in the face with a cloud of smoke and start coughing. i find the other girls on my floor and start running down the stairs, but one of them turns around and ask "where's simi?" so i decide in my state of mind that i need to go back and get simi and kristen. as i got back t my floor alex stopped me and told me to get out and she went and got them. so then we all congregated outside and i still have one shoe on. so we go to our friend's room in the dorm next to us and rest until we could get back inside. once back, we see that there is fire extiguisher stuff EVERYWHERE and all in all it was pretty scary, but looking back it was hilarious.
