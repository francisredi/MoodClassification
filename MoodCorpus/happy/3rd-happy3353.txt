GW Progress Notes, Day Two
It's very much Christmas in Ascalon, and thanks to the generosity of NCsoft, we on the servers (at least Post-Searing) got to celebrate it early with some slight alterations to the city of Ascalon just in time for the season. Instead of it being some overly depressing, ugly piece of shit it normally is (which it has every right to be, since it is *post-Searing* Ascalon), the programmers transformed it into a winter wonderland of sorts. Instead of it being a muddy shit-mess, it was covered in snow, and it was nighttime instead of it's normal late-afternoon atmosphere vibe. Christmas lights were strung up between the tents in Merchant's Row, and there was a large Christmas tree in the middle of the crafter's square with shitloads of presents. It was complete with a storyteller telling stories about Wintersday, and up in the northern portion of the city was a row of large candy canes on a ledge that overlooked the city itself. All in all, it was extremely gorgeous, and for someone who desperately wishes it'd snow in real life, it was a welcome change of pace, and extremely beautiful ^.^ If you want to see piccies, go to my yahoo 360 blog at http://360.yahoo.com/my_profile.html and look in my photo albums for pictures not only of the Christmas theme, but of nekkid parties taken way back in the day with me and my friend Ruri.
