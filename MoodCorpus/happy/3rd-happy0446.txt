Not much is going on..
My life is boringly pleasant. 
I am not complaining, it's nice for a change,for the past 5 years my life has been one crazy event after another. Its nice to be calm. Calm and happy.

I just wrapped all of Dave's presents. Which brings me to this Rant, what the hell is up with cat's having to lay on anything new? "Oh I dont beleive I have ever layed upon this before"....
I put the tree skirt down last night and now they are fighting over who gets to lay on it. I pull out wrapping paper and lay it on the floor, Jaspurr comes right over and plops himself right across the middle of the tube (I mean that cant be comfortable right?) I push him off and proceed with wrapping gifts, as they are wrapped I put them off to the side and Jaspurr walks up and sit directly on the middle of a gift, squashing it with his huge furry ass..I got so mad I pushed him off and hissed angrily. He hid under the couch giving me dirty looks, I just hissed again.
20 minutes later he was rubbing all over me again. Damn cats are strange creature.

I am off to watch born into brothel's and sew up the seems on the baby booties I knit for my co-worker's son to be. 

Happy Early solstice to all, it actually fall on Wednesday afternoon next week. 
At least we will have a white yule this year, feels better for a maritimes gal like myself. I love snow. I hate cold bitter winds, but I love snow.
