Small Children, Communist Invasions, and Drunken Rage
A whole bunch of stuff happened today, and it was pretty cool to say the very least.  However, more than anything, some rather unusual things happened... but I'll get there in a second.  The day was kinda slow, with a lot of bitching by my father, but oh well, its not that horrible I guess.

Anyway, I was finally able to get to see Caitlyn, and its awesome since she was able to spend the whole day!  She got here pretty early, like around ten I think, and so that was awesome.  I was sooooo glad to see her its not even funny.  But, we went ahead and watched a movie while we waited for time to go, and since we had nothing else, we watched Moonraker.  Of course, there were a few ugly things, but lets just say that while the movie ruled, the communists were invading the summer house, and when you wrestle with a girl after that chain of events takes its course, it turns out bad.  So, before heading down to the pope's place, we stopped off at Caitlyn's place so she could take care of the problem, and we went on our way.  Heh, I'll never forget that... funny to me, embarrassing as hell to her.

Anyway, the Vatican thing was BORING!  Given we saw the pope hammer, pope shoes, pope stool, pope stick, and a lot of other papal items, nothing really caught my eye.  And then dinner got jacked up so we ended up eating Chinese, but it was soooo cool!  It kinda felt like it was just me and her, and it was finally our lives together.  Hehe, yay!  I love panda!  After dinner we went home, and I got in a huge fight with my father... but oh well.  Ugh, don't want to talk about that, and I think I'll keep most of what happened today to myself, so until next time, that's all for today!
