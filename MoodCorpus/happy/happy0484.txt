just an update
wow, I'm so tired, and it's so early... lol. Keith is here for the weekend, and since we spend a lot of time laying down and cuddling, I get tired very fast and easily and fall asleep very early. It's just really relaxing.

Oh! ok, so it was about 12:00 and I was doing my take home final for one of my classes. It isn't due for a while, I just figured I'd start it. It was 2 hours before work so I was trying to kill time too. Keith called me and asked how I was, and I figured he was calling during lunch at work, cause sometimes he does to say hi. He was like "how would you like to see me before work?" my mouth dropped and I was like "you're here already?!?!" And he told me he was about 10 minutes from campus! I was sooooo excited. I thought he wouldn't get here until about 9pm, because I thought he would be leaving after work like he normally does. But he took one of his sick days since he has a bunch of them and hasn't used any up yet, so he figured he'd take one and leave early and surprise me. How sweet is that?! It's also good he left early because there was a real bad storm up here in the northeast. Snow in NJ and upstate, bad snow. Most schools upstate here were closed, but for some reason the Cortland area didn't get much snow at all, maybe a couple inches. Other areas got almost a foot, I think. At home it downpoured though, no snow. Thank goodness, lol. 

So yeah, it was really nice seeing him 8 hours before I expected him :-)

Oh, and I spoke with my Godmother's psychic friend last night, so I'll do an entry on that hopefully Sunday sometime :-)
