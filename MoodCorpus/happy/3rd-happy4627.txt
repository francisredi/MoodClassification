Merry Christmas!
I'm a little late on that.  But merry christmas all the same.  I worked until 6 and got paid!  Yay.  I gave my dad a hundred bucks and promised my mom an outfit when we go to the After-Christmas Sale.  I almost cried when my mom gave me and my brother twenty bucks and said she wished she could give us more but she had no money.  I love my mom.  It doesn't matter how much she gives me, it's the thought that counts.  I think it's now our turn to give more than the parents consider that now we earn money.  It just made me nearly tear up from how apologetic she looked as she handed each of us a twenty.  I love my family because we always want to give each other the best.  That's what being in love is about, isn't it?  Always wanting the very best for the loved ones.  I feel so loved right now, I can't even handle it.  Christmas isn't about gifts.  Christmas is about family and the celebration of love and what love can fuel.  For Christians, it's about God's ultimate love and gift to His people, for others, it's about expressing how much one means to them.  In the end, the general theme of Christmas is love so I'll end this post by saying...

I love you

to all of my friends, my bf, my family, and those who touched my heart and care for me.  Thank you for offering your love to me and I offer my love in return.  Merry Christmas.
