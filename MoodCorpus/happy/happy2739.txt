Yeah, I did something vaguely similar a while ago, so blame  for tagging me ;)

Ground rules: The first player of this "game" starts with the topic "Five Weird Habits of Yourself" and the people who get tagged need to then write a LJ entry about their five quirky little habits as well as state the rules of this game clearly. In the end, you need to list the next five people who you want to tag.

1. I never set/turn anything to an even number. Never set my alarm clock for an even number, only turn the stereo volume up to an odd, never leave a place on an even number. What can I say? I'm odd ;)

2. I watch Russian news and Spanish news daily. And my TV rarely leaves CNN unless one of my shows comes on. 

3. I never ever button or zip my pants when I'm lounging around. Poor  learned that one this weekend in the hotel room. LOL

4. I hate snow. Seriously, even the thought of snow makes me irrational and angry.

5. I seldom wake up on the same end and side of the bed that I fell asleep on.

Tagging: , , , , .

Speaking of those last two beautiful gals, we had a grand old fangirly time together yesterday. From lunch to skipping to Maria and her lovely tortillas to haunted houses to fangirling to beaches to obsessively fangirling to bridges to singing in the car to roller-coasters to aiding and abetting felons (solicitors) to ice cream to booze to yellow Xterras and all the photo ops with and in between. I say we do it all again next week ;P
