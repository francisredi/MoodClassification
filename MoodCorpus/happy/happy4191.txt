Isn't jumping to conclusions fun?
I am overly excited right now. About what, I am not going to say quite yet. But possibly, I may be having a change in fortune. So even though it's silly of me to be getting all worked up and excited/hopes up, I'm doing it anyways.

In other news, I had my last feminist praxis class today, and it was yet another awesome class. I'm sad that it's over, but we're going out for drinks next week after we hand in our final essay so that will be good. And I have a class with Ronnie next semester that I'm really excited about. My poster presentation went well, people liked my poster, which I was kinda worried about cuz it wasn't all that I had hoped it would be, but I got an A on it, so woo hoo! I presented on my essay on women's sexuality on Tuesday and that also went really well. People were quite interested in what I had to say. I think it's funny that I can get up infront of a group of people and talk about sexuality without the slightest hint of embarrassment. So yeah, awesome. I felt I did really well with the questions part, I was able to respond well to people's questions and this gave me confidence for my thesis defense. It was definately easier to present to my WMST class though cuz the level of trust and respect in that class was really well founded.

Anyways, I'm like, massively ignoring this huge huge essay I've got to write for tomorrow which apparently cannot be written the night before it's due and still recieve a good grade. Well, I'm going to test that theory and hopefully prove it wrong. So wish me luck, on a number of things. ;)
