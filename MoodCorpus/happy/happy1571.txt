my weekend
I had a really good weekend, even though I didn't get to see Taylor or Cooper (which makes me sad).&nbsp; My mother is a fucking NAZI!!! 
On friday I had to go to my cousin's b-day party and it got over at 7, I asked if I could go to the thunderbird cuz there was plenty of time.&nbsp; She's like no, you don't have a ride, you go down there all the time...blah blah blah.&nbsp; So I was like "whatever" and just sat in the car.&nbsp; Then she's like "OH! I need to go to a candle store and since you two are here, you're coming with me"...the candle store was the one right by the fucking thunderbird! So I was like "hey, can I just walk down there...it's not that far" and she's like "no! you must bond with me because I'm a bitch nazi" (well something like that, lol) and I just figured we were goin Christmas shopping which isn't so bad because I need to go anyway.&nbsp; Well, we end up going straight home, I lock myself in my room, she leaves AGAIN!, and there's that night.&nbsp; Made me so fucking mad! She could have easily dropped me off at the thunderbird and no harm would be done, but as I've said before she's a bitch nazi!
Yesterday was pretty much great.&nbsp; I went to see Chronicals of Narnia with Travis.&nbsp; It was a pretty good movie and I liked going with him.&nbsp; He's probably the sweetest guy I've ever dated.&nbsp; (oh yeah, he asked me out and I said yes)&nbsp; I really like him a lot...he makes me so happy just being around him.&nbsp; He says the nicest things, like wow.&nbsp; I love him, and I'm so happy.&nbsp; but i won't get into that right now.
Today there's a Christmas party at my house which blows...my relatives don't know when christmas is obviously lol.&nbsp; but yep...that's it
