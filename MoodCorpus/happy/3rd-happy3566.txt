Brain cleansing
While it didn't have the complete effect that I wanted it to, skiing for a few hours this afternoon did allow my brain to go blank for a while.  I wasn't completely relaxed because I hadn't worn my neck gator and thus had my shoulders positioned up near my earlobes most of the afternoon (it was windy over on the east side of the mountain, where I spent most of the day).  Still, it was a gorgeous day and it felt good to breathe some fresh air for a change.

We leave for the Lakehouse tomorrow morning.  We got home about 45 minutes ago and I'm up doing laundry and damned and determined to clean the bathroom and pack before I go to bed.  We have to stop in Utica to pick up a kayak (my FIL bought a one-seater for my MIL for Christmas) and then probably stop in Albany so my husband can finish his Christmas shopping (he's at least started it...I think).

I'm looking forward to a couple of days of nothingness.  We're skiing on Saturday at either Windham or Bellayre.  Sunday we head back here in the afternoon to dine with my parents.  I think I'm going to ski on Monday again.  

Since this is the last post for a while, Merry Christmas to each and every one of you.  I hope you all have nice, quiet days spent with loved ones and that many happy memories are created and remembered.
