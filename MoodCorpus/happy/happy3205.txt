Sunday
Man is it hard to stay on my diet right now. I so just want some chinese, but alas, I can't, I got up to 145 since Otakon. I'm trying to get back to 135 but man, I could go for one of everything right now. Maybe I just need to make a low carb pumpkin cheesecake, yeah, that's what I'll do..I'm going off to walmart to pick up some cream cheese and pumpkin! Ok, now that that's settled..the whole Advent Children Cloud figure thing is kinda up in the air, I want to get it but I don't want to spend more than $70 on it, it has 2 days left and it's already at $61, leaving me only 9 bucks to bid with. Looks like I'm probably out of luck. Which I guess is ok, I have alot of other things I need to concentrate my money on. Christmas presents for one, I am trying to get nice quality presents this year. Last year it was like each present was in the $5 range. That just awfull for me to sit through, ya know, when the family opens their gift and you know they don't even like it, but you were too cheap to get them something nice. I don't know if half my problem is cheapness either though, each year they never tell us what they want, we just have to play the guessing game. Christmas can be so nerve racking! Other than that, I want to get fabric for the Christmas cosplay, I haven't even started on that and I have like 2/3 more weeks. Happy news for me though, the new season of Aqua Teen Hunger Force is starting I think today, so, I am wicked excited! I love that show so much, it has the type of humor that is just so out there, I never know what they are going to say, which is my favorite type of comedy. That and I seem to like running gags alot. Lol, ok, I'm sure no one cares which comedy I like so I am just going to wrap up my daily lj update now.
