ohhhh jesus
I LOVE the way that things work themselves out!!!!

I was SURE that i was getting some kind of D in Theory but i must have done swell on the final because i got a C+... which might sound crappy but its my only grade that isn't an A! And i was doing soooo bad in ear training but after spending hours in the practice room i showed my professor how determined i am and it paid off big time! and she loves me and has become one of my closest professors that i can talk to about all of my musical issues. the day of my practical exam she told me "you were practically failing and now everything you do is A work. even if you don't get the A that you deserve because of how poorly you were doing, be proud of your B. you have come a long way!!!" she is right... i'm like a completely different ear training student. it has changed me as a musician and brought me closer to the music that i love.
 I had an incomplete in RLC for not emailing my final in on time but i emailed my teacher and sent him an attatchment to this paper, told him how i am home with the flu and now he is putting a change of grade form in so i can have my A!!!!

Kryssi Battalene? All A's??? (except for theory, but the C+ was a fucking miracle.)

i'm so happy right now. so yea, i have the flu but since i know that everything is going to be so awesome i am too excited to care.
things to look forward to:

seeing my parents faces when the get the best report card ever
seeing my friends
having money again
dana time
boston trip
chilling with my mom

i bought my parents a gift certificate to a fancy restaurant for christmas. it made me feel like a grown up. and then feeling like a grown up started to feel like the flu and now i'm on the couch.

if anyone is home and wants to come visit me i am on antibiotic so i won't make them sick:) and i will make them tea!!!
