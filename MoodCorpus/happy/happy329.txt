bullshit
You know what? I was going to make an entry and comment on all of the bullshit that is going on with my friends being hurt and all that jazz but it is not even worth it. I'm sick off all of the crap and some people just really need to grow up and stop being so bitchy and hurting people that don't deserve it. and that is all I am going to say about that.

Today sucked I totally got my ass handed to me by my fucking math test. 

But I talked to andrew and he was being such a sweetheart telling me all the things he missed about me and stuff like that =) *sigh* I figured out something today though. He wanted me to tell him what I missed about him and I couldn't do it because I was being too shy and he's like "I'm not going to think any different of you." Believe it or not...I think I might have found someone who will pull me out of my shell =D (But don't tell Andy lol.) Because I have realized that Andrew wants a more confident girl and he sees that in me. I need to let it out. I want to win him, there are like at least 6 other girls in the running and i knwo that is not fair but you know what it happens and I care about him so I am going to keep trying I am going to get a car and I am going to WIN!

(And I apologize if I am talking about him too much I just don't want this to end up in my Xanga cuz he reads it and so does Eric I think so yeah it doesn't belong in there...it might start oozing out soon but uh what can ya do? Just tell me if you get sick of hearing about it and I promise I will stop.)
