What a wonderful gift....
I got the best gift this holiday that I could have gotten.

The hubby and I went to my ex-hubby and his wife's for Christmas dinner.  BOth of our kids were going to be there, the boy and his soon to be wife, and the girl and our grandson.

For those without background, the girl ran away from home at 17 and has not spoken to me for almost 8 years, save the short 9-12 months right after the grandson was born 6 1/2 years ago.  The Ex-hubby and his wife have had regular contact with them since about a year after she left.

Anyhoodle!  When the hubby and I walked in yesterday, she was the first to wave at me.  I told her how amazing she looks, which she pshawed (she is about 4 months pregnant and doesn't feel like she looks wonderful, though she does!)  We mad some small talk, and I was able to tell her that I love her, to which she replied she loves me too! (Faint!)  We laughed a bit when I tried to stuff the innerds back into my grandson's head, as I was told that I squeezed him so tight that his head popped!  She looked at me and asked if I had lost weight as I looked as if I had.  (Yes, I have!)

A bit later, she chit-chatted with the hubby, which she has talked to even less than me.  I was busy helping the Ex's wife, giving her a Reiki treatment when The girl and the grandson had to leave, so missed being able to say goodbye, but....

This was the best thing that has happened to me in a very long time.  The Ex's wife told me that she is/has been working to facilitate better times between the two of us (which I have known).  She also said that she has a vision of both her and me being in the delivery room with the girl when this one is born.  Wouldn't that both freak out the doctors and be wonderful?!?!?!  

Cross your fingers, everyone!
