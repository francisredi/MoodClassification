BOTHA!
Much thanks go to  for my spiffy new LJ icon. That's Ron from Puppet Pal Harry Potter Theatre. If you haven't seen PPHPT yet, you're missing out! Uhh, I'd give the link but have forgotten it. Do a Google search or something! :P

So today was pretty nice, other than being cold. I did a few things at the bank, hit Asiana for the lunch buffet, then hits the comic book shop for a little reading. Talked with the owner, Chris, about the wonders of Amazon.com as well. Came up because there was a trade paperback that I waited until it came into the store rather than buy it from Amazon. Chris runs a cool shop so I like giving him as much business as I can. Got home, cruised the web, watched another episode of Millenium and finally got around to watching last week's episodes of Lost and Invasion. I'm not sure what the hell they're doing with Invasion now that Alias is moving into its timeslot. And there wasn't any mention of it at the end of this episode. I wonder if they're taking one of those looooong winter breaks until January?

And wonders of all wonders, I got to watch the Charlie Brown Christmas special! This is the first time in probably a decade that I've seen both the Thanksgiving and Christmas special! Yeah, I could always get them on DVD, but what's the fun in that?

Anyways, that was my day. It's back to work for a little while tomorrow. I hope everyone is doing well and enjoying the holiday season. Take it easy!
