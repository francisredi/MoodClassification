I can touch my eyeball!
After all these years, I can finally touch my eyeball again! That means...I MIGHT GET CONTACTS! I've had to depend on glasses since I was nine years old. It's been an extreme burden, especially the last few years. I'm thankful that I have glasses so I can see (b/c without then I'm like nearly blind), but I'm always worrying about them breaking or trying to keep them clean. I can't touch my face or lay down without cocking my head a certain way or even put on clothes with having to take them off or manuvere around them. When I sweat, the nose piece rubs the bridge of my nose raw. If it starts to rain while I'm outside, I have to try to not get the lens wet. It's just so many things that come with having to wear glasses. I got contacts when I was 16, but could never get them in myself. My eyes have a mind of their own and they'd blink at the wrong times. A few days ago I accidentally found out I could touch my eyeball when I was trying to get an eyelash out. I tried it again this morning in front of a mirror and I could do it without my eye blinking. I sure hope that I can get contacts. Does anyone have contacts? How are they working for you?

In other news, I GOT MY LAST TEXTBOOK! Can you tell I'm excited today? :D My exam booklet has a little graduation hat on the front. *hops happily* I can't wait to finish these last three exams and get my Early Childhood Education degree. I also can't wait to see my grades. This is like the first time I've ever wanted to see what my adverage was for school.
