what we did when people thought we were mad at them...
yay, so quinn shannon and i got all gussied up to go to P.F. Changs...when we got there it was like a 2 hour wait, but we didn't want to eat elsewhere so we walked around the mall, it was pretty interesting.  we decided that we should have some excuse for why we were dressed up, and we decided to make up a new excuse every time someone asked us.  first it was quinn's birthday, then we wanted to say that shannon wanted to see santa...
first story- two old people came up to us, told us we looked nice, and said that they were glad we weren't wearing slutty jeans slung down around our hips

second story- some guy walks by with his friends and calls out "yay! cheerleaders" first we though that was creepy, but then we were just confused, what cheerleaders wear fancy dresses?!

3rd story- at J Crew, when they asked us, me and shannon kind of looked at each other and were like "it's her birthday." so the people all start wishing her happy birthday, asking her questions about getting her license, etc.  then we were laughing and walking around the store, and the guy comes up to us and says "here's a $10 gift card, happy birthday!" we felt so awful, we hurried out of there. 
anyway, the mall was decorated beautifully and we felt very fancy and x-massy, i ate so much yummy chinese food, it's crazy.  anyway, now it's x-mas eve!  i'm terribly excited.  Merry Christmas/ Happy Holidays...
