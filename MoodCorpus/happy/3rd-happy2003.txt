The Quest for Stretchy Shiny Pants and forking
Yesterday, me, Jordana and Manny went on a quest to get me and Jordana stretchy, shiny pants for transing.  We went to Modells and I got the stretchy shiny pants.  Then we went to Wendys and back to Jordana's house.  She wanted to practice a bit bc that night she was going to be Columbia.  I played as many parts as I could bc it's fun to.  Then Manny and me went back to campus and I showed him the funniness that is the Retarded Animal Babies Cartoons.  A lot of my friends from here came to Rocky which made me happy.  In the cast room in the movie theater (nicknamed the fishbowl), Jordana brought Dani cake for the dinner scene bc she was Janet.  First she tickled me and then she poked me with a plastic fork.  I, of course, laughed.  Her and Rob started poking me with plastic forks.  I've been forked.  As pay back, I tickled her when she was near me.  Transies are supposed to molest Brad and Janet anyway.  I also grabbed Sean's ass and he said, "If your friends with my brother, you are not allowed to grab my ass."  I got to do There's a Light for the first time and did a very good job of transing if  I do say so myself.  GEORGE WAS RIFF RAFF!!  He is so adorable!  I loved his performance and I hope he does it again.  After the show, a bunch of us went to Six Brothers Diner.  When we finally got back to campus, I was tired.  Dead tired.  And the elevators are broken.  I got piggy back rides from Manny and Marco from the sixth/main floor to the twelveth floor.  I'm going to have to bring my old backpack up here bc I cant use my school bag anymore.  And the one time I go to use a plastic bag again, it breaks.  Oh well.

Wow, this is my shortest entry in a while.  

I don't have Rocky until January 7, the holiday show, which I can't go to bc I'm going to be on a boat.  I'm going on a cruise.  My next show is my vote in day on January 14th.  

Kay.  That's all for now.
