End of term wrap-up
Today was the last day of class here at the University of Doom. Tomorrow is the kick-off of the best part of the semester: Finals Week. This year we aren't given two studies as usual, it would cause the term to run too long or something. As it is, we get off three days before Christmas. In any case, today was the day of biogeography. We had our final "quiz" and to be honest, I barely stuided for it. The last quiz was on evolution and trust me when I say I've had that theory drilled into my head. In any case, the only part I liked was the article by National Geographics: Was Darwin Wrong? The best part of the article was where the writer said that the theory of evolution was like the theory of gravity. It cracked me up because even though the author tried to present both sides of the argument, you could tell he didn't see much merit in the other side that thought God created everything.

Layne invited me over to study. We watched Will & Grace, then I came home and worked on my mood theme for this journal. Lots of studying? Ha. Eitherway, yesterday I had my spanish oral final. It went better than expected. I thought for sure I'd blunder my way through, but it was rather nicely. The day before that (Monday) we had the listening final. That did not go well. It was like listening to my teacher, but increased by two hundred percent and then adding a heavy accent.

It has snowed at least a couple inches over the last twenty four hours. Julia and I went outside and played in the snow on the UDS lawn. It was hella fun. We built a fort called The Ruins of the Agora...namely cause we got bored and started writing stuff in the snow. I'll take a picture tomorrow when it's light and post it. 

That about wraps it up. I have to finish my manuscript for non-fiction. ^.^
