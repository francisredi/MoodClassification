Merry Christmas, Yule or whatever.
Well, I'm home in PEI and waiting for a phone call from a friend of mine, and after the last few days I have been reminded of just how much of home I've missed. Running into old friends and actually getting to spend time with them for once, as opposed to the stupidly quick 'hey how'ya doin' visits' that usually end up happening when I come down have opened my eyes to a few things. All of my old grudges seem to have faded and gone away with some of my old friends down here. Which is good. You do not want to keep hate in your soul for a long time. So to those of you who I have seen, have not seen yet or probably won't see for one reason or another, I wish you all a Merry Christmas!

I also have been thinking about my friends from Halifax as well, my roommates and a few others, and I find I miss them too, even though I've only been away for a short while at this point and coming back to Halifax anyway. I hope you guys are all having a happy holiday season! And hey, we still have to have Kung Fu Movie Night when I get back!!!!

To my friends from the wonderful world of the online world, who I've met and talked to over the years. Many of you, especially if you are on my friends list at all, are more than just some people I chat with. I have always considered all of you close, true friends as well. I hope you are all well, and even though I may not be the best at keeping in touch, I wish you all a Merry Christmas.

Anyway, I'm just cleaning up the computer here and finally getting rid of some of the problems's they've been having,so I thought I'd kill time and post an entry. Merry Christmas to you all!

Oh, and by the way, if you havn't seen it yet, go to see King Kong! It is soooo worth the ticket price, and it has to be the best movie starring a large gorilla I have ever seen!
