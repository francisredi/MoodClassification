The weekend
We got up bright and early, despite fervently wishing we didn't have to, to drive to Essex to pick up two new degus from a breeder there who sells them. We were almost at her village when we realised we hadn't brought her address with us and hence we didn't know which house number. Cue lots of texting round those of our mates we thought might be up, and also Ian. Dave Rimmer got back to us fastest though and so won our undying gratitude by logging into Alan's email and getting the address. 

They're both female, and are called Clover and Mayan. They're a lot braver than Guinness and Crouton were when we first got them, but we thought we'd give them time to get used to their new surroundings before we introduce Guiness to them. So tey're currently in seperate cages, with Guiness attempting to build an escape tunnel.


The party went pretty well, as far as I can tell. Certainly people seemed to be having fun, presents went down well, and most people got slightly hammered, me included. I learned the following things:
 - A sausage roll at 9am followed by nothing until a glass of wine at 6pm is not always recommended.
 - Keith likes sweets shaped like letters
 - Dave "laser eye" Lucke can find anything except his own car keys
 - Degus aren't scared of toy snakes
 - Barney is mental enough to drive home to Nottingham after a party in West Sussex.
 - Wearing a greenish shirt is a clear sign of lycanthropy

It was fun. But I've got a mountain of washing up to do now.
