i didnt send you to go-kart camp!
so my mom tried to kill me by leaving the stove on, the house was completely filled with gas and i realized it after having been home for about an hour, way to almost ruin christmas mom!

i got WWF sheets at the swap meet AND saw a gang fight there if someone came near my wwf sheets i would have had to jump in as well

i am seeing the aquabats on saturday and boy am i giddy as ever! i havent seen a full set of theirs in 8 years!

had travi band practice a couple nights ago, things are coming along quite nicely might i add, we are called chilly willy, and dave got his cast off which means we can start that band that im gonna sing for, i want to be called bearded lady, and start dirt dave & the tennessee knucklebusters practicing again as well

over the past few days i have purchased the following in the VHS category; Jingle all the way, I'll be home for christmas, aaron carter, are you afraid of the dark?, death wish 4 - the crackdown!, and HEAVYWEIGHTS! i will admit that i am pretty darn proud of ma-self. 

next time we go to wendys maresa, you dont need to compromise, PERSONALIZE GIRRL!
