Sleigh bells riiinnnggg are ya listenin?
I can't believe christmas is this weekend! I've been making christmas cookies since last night and they're awweesome. I still have to decorate some of them though. There are so many and I still have like, two batches to make haha. Baking christmasy things always puts me in the holiday spirit. Good stuff, I tells ya. Also have to send out my christmas cards today or tommorow. My overseas family will probably get them AFTER christmas but hey, I didn't have time to send them earlier! Work is swamped this time of year!
Also have to finish my gift shopping on wednesday. Ugh, it seems like it's so far away still! But christmas always sneaks up on me in this country. I don't have the snow around to remind me haha. I rarely ever get overly excited about this holiday but this year is the first christmas shaun and I get to spend TOEGTHER (last year we didn't see each other until a couple weeks afterward), and so I'm making a big deal out of it and making all this food to bring to his parents house for lunch/dinner that day haha. What can I say? I come from a family where everyone would bake or make 2378632654 things for every family holiday gathering, so I can't help but follow suit!

This year has seriously flown by, I can't wrap my head around the fact that it's almost january 2006. I seems like just yesterday I was packing to move to adelaide after I got back from the states. But in reality that was forever ago and now I have just over a couple months until elyse is here, just over a couple months until my grandparents are here, just over a year until my wedding and just over a year until I'm visiting america again! '06 is going to rule!
