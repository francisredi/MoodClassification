I'm doin a dance in my head right now
YEAHHHH!!! I am done. I took my last final taoday at 2:30 and now I am free to booze and smoke pot and do all the other things i've been missin lately. In fact as a little "yay I didn't drop out this semester" gift to myself, i stopped by Ross on the way home and picked up a fab set of martini glasses, then i popped into the buy food place for a botle of vodka and some lime juice. Now i'm home, with a cosmopolitian in my hand and a pizza in the oven, and a few hundred dollars to look forward to tonight. 

The only dark cloud in my day was that Erik did loose his defferal which means he is now a convicted felon. But on the upside he might get to have this all erased in 6 months if the judge happens to be in a good mood that day. Also, some old man slammed on his breaks and tried to make me hit his car ( i didn't) and when i drove past him he honked at me with his loud ass sedan horn and scared the crap out of me. I've been way jumpy lately for some reason and i almost swerved into oncoming traffic.

So, thank you to everyone who thought of me this semester and wished me well and dealt with my bitching. I raise my glass and toast you all! Salude! I hope everyone that i love is happy right now, especially my kristin and my maria whom i miss more than anyone else at the moment.
