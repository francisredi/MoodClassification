The Take
After a wonderful morning of bacon-and-eggs breakfast and coffee (plus the morning shows that all of Washington watches since Christmas happens to be on a Sunday), it was time for some family unity.

It was quite a musical Christmas for me.  I am the proud owner of speakers for my laptop (very useful as it plays movies very quietly).  The highlight of this year's fantastic gifts is a toss up between my clarinet (I'm thinking of southern names for her, Charlotte and Georgia are the current frontrunners but I'm open to suggestions) and a total blindside gift:  a Creative Zen Micro given by my Mom!  I've long been considering a digital audio player and this one is perfect!

My Dad loved "1776" as my sister did "Serenity."  It was a great Christmas as we didn't get enormously extravagant things for each other - it was nice and plain.  The exceptions were the videocamera my sister recieved and my Zen Micro.  All in all, we got many more books, movies, and food than anything else.  Snudgie got a nice new bed.  She seems to like it - she's zonked out in the corner.

Most practical:  a reusable rolling lint-remover!  Thanks Mom!  (Seriously)

Most amazing overall:  a periodic table of the elements tie!  Score!

Weirdest:  My sister got a bottle of liquor!  FROM MY MOM!  Not only that, it's a hallucinogen!  It's 70% alcohol by volume!  What is my Mom thinking?!  Supposedly she got it for her just for the bottle (it IS quite pretty).

My Dad is stuffing himself on pastel licorice that was given to us - I think he is going to finish the bag in one sitting.  The family is repairing somewhat before watching a Pink Panther movie together (my Mom's gift to Dad) and then heading out to Aunt Ellen's for dinner.

It's kind of grey and raining here in Washington, but it's quite cozy beside the fire with the family.

Merry Christmas to all.

Cheers,
Randall
