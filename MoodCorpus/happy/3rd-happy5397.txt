Day of Large Food
So my first full day here. I woke up at 0600, but made myself go back to sleep until I heard the rest of the family up and about. We celebrated a small belated Christmas. I got a nice little box with local shells on it from mom and dad. Mostly they gave each other clothes. Mom made banna-nut pancakes as big as the plate. Then we walked the three blocks to the beach. The surf is high right now here on the north shore so we just walked along and watched the waves. The common footwear here is 'slippers', aka flip flops. But it really is what everyone wears. 

We got back to the house long enough for me to talk to Curt for a few minutes then we had to take Mom to work. Traffic was bad but at least I got to see the scenery. We drove past Waimiea bay, Pipeline and Sunset Beach. We stopped at Pipeline, but the waves were bad today. Still I could at least get an idea of what a real hawaiian pipeline wave looks like. Dad said sometime next week maybe we can take a surf lesson together. Imagine me on a surfboard! Still, that would be really cool. Apparently they just had some big surf championships last week. We also stopped for a 'slice' of pizza that was as big as our plates.

The highlight of the day though was going out to Puena Point just after sunset and watching the International Space Station pass overhead. It was at a -1 magnitude so it was really bright. And for the first time I looked at Mars and it was actually red. There is so little light pollution out here. It took about 5 minutes for ISS to race overhead and disapear into the horizon. There were two other sattelites as bonus too. That was just amazing. Venus is really bright too (mag -4.4). We might go out and try to see Saturn in a little bit.

The only thing nicer would be if Curt were here. Ah well, we'll have to see what the next weeks hold.
