Wheeeee DMB!
Ok, finals are approaching so I don't have much time to spare writing in my journal, but I did have to note the fantastic experience that was DMB.&nbsp; I expect that &nbsp;will provide a detailed review, so I'll not do so, and will just note certain specifics.
FINALLY a show in Nebraska.&nbsp; The last time DMB played in Omaha I was a junior in high school and not really into them yet, so I didn't see them in 1996.&nbsp; Since I became wise to the ways of DMB I've traversed this great country to see them (Bonner Springs (2), Dallas, Ames, Chicago, Wisconsin) so it was nice to see them basically in my backyard - although it did take me nearly an hour to get to the Qwest Center from West Omaha.&nbsp; GAH!
Firstly, thanks to the graciousness of a very kind soul, we scored some 12th row Main Floor tickets.&nbsp; We hadn't had seats that good since our first show at Sandstone.&nbsp; I appreciated that the people around me seemed like genuine DMB fans and not just "OMIGOD I LOVE AMERICAN BABY!" fans.&nbsp; I realized that I'm no longer a youngin and standing for three hours and grooving at a concert is hard on my aging knees :-)&nbsp; I hadn't listened to any of the new album, mostly due to school consuming most of my life, but the new songs were alright.&nbsp; Big fan of Louisiana Bayou.&nbsp; It seemed like the volume could have been turned up for Leroi and Stephan - I'd have liked to hear Leroi's sax solos a little better.&nbsp; Boyd and Carter were amazing as usual of course and Dave seemed to be pretty talkative, though I can never understand what the hell he's saying :-)&nbsp; 
Overall it was a great show.&nbsp; I'd like to rewind parts of it in my brain to keep me sane throughout finals.&nbsp;
