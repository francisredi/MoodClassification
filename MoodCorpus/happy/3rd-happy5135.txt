Is It Crazy For You?
Today was a crazy day for shopping. Obivously, I should have thought about that before going. I mean, what was I thinking?! It's the day after Christmas, it's crazy to go out shopping. I went to the mall to spend my Christmas money which was $170 dollars. I went to EBGames store first and the store was so crowded and half of the sheleves was empty. I wanted to get Animal Crossing: WW but they were sold out. Luckily, I got a decent game called Suikoden III. After that, I went to American Eagle to spend my $30 gift card. I got myself a "I Am A Catch" shirt and a baseball shirt. I saw one of my old friends that I haven't seen in 10 years. We waved but didn't get to talk to each other because she was busy. After that, I went bargain-shopping in FYE but found none that was worth the price they put on these albums. I went to Borders to try my luck again and brought 7 albums costing me $120.

Those 7 albums were "Fumbling Towards Ecstasy" by Sarah McLachlan, "Sheryl Crow" by Sheryl Crow (duh!), "Aerial" by Kate Bush, "Confessions On A Dance Floor" by Madonna, "Have A Nice Day" by Bon Jovi, "The Best of Morrissey" by Morrissey, and "Hot Fuss" by The Killers. All those for $120 and I am sure it was worth the money to get them.

On with the christmas gifts. I got a lot of stuff since my father's side is a large family and my mother's side isn't but they like to spend a lot. I got two Johnny Cash albums and a cd set titled "Johnny Cash: The Legend", "Pearl" by Janis Joplin, "Extraordinary Machine" by Fiona Apple, a Johnny Cash shirt, Johnny Cash's autobiography, and others that may be of no interest to anybody here.

Oh, by the way. If you are wondering why I said "Is It Crazy For You" - Me, it's because I was listening to a recording of me singing a song I made for the talent show two years ago. I won third place with that song. That is probably the proudest moment of my life.
