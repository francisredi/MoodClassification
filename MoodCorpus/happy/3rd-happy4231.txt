HAPPY SOLSTICE!!!!
Yes, I said solstice. It's a prefered term, since I really don't care what you call the season so long as you have fun with it. So Happy Solstice and Merry Cristmas!!!! However, I will now proceed to bore you with my solstice inventory

So what did I get? ^_^ well, for starters, I'm typing this from my brand new silvery laptop!!!! Woo! very veryveryvery awesome! oh! and it's formatted so that I can finally put all my film tapes onto the comp and write them to DVDs! Yess! I can actually get copies of fun times to my friends! too cool. 

I also got, from Tabby, a very entertaining game for the GBA based on Spirit: Stallion of the Cimmaron! Much like the movie, the game is cute, if not equine-accurate. Coolest thing? the horses you get to save are semi-randomly picked from a list of them, all with pretty colors and names that I think I'm going to rename in my head @_@ I'm trying to get the appaloosa but shh! don't let the game know >.> It's simple to play, but I've been playing it over and over, I think not having to struggle through a game is a refreshing change actually ^_^ Thanks Tabby!

I also got (real quickly now) a whole bunch of really warm, and quite nice looking clothes! I'm estatic about this since I'm moving to Virginia in the mountains where it's uber-cold @_@. That's what half my list consists of actually.

I got two PS2 games, Lego Star Wars (o_O from David, Tiff's boyfriend) and the NMX game from my parents, which is very very cool, even if Sally sounds like she wants to be a fairy princess and Jack's new voice actor sounds like he's trying much too hard at times (qoute Jack "Am I trying much too hard?" ) They reused the songs, although they changed the lyrics since it's no longer about Christmas. I was very annoyed with that, but Jack and Sally's song sounds really nice, and Halloween Town was left the same. In fact, "Halloween Town" is the battle music! 

I got a PDA thing from a friend of my moms, which earns the award for best present given by a total stranger @_@. I swear, that lady would give you her house if she thought it would make you happy. She kept filling my glass of wine even when I said I didn't want anymore (which was after my first glass actually @_@)

Not done collecting gifts, but I'm happy either way ^_^ I also got a candle set (yay!)and a horse necklace (yay!) If I forgot anything (bleh @_@) I'll update this post and add it. 

Oh! and Luci! your present hasn't come in yet ;_; mostly 'cause it's the weekend. I'll get it to ya as soon as I can I promise, I *did* get you something besides the Shadow doll!
