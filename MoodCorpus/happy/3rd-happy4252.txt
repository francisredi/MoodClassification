Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!
You know, I was going to write a long, drawn out detail of this past year... But I have come to the conclusion that 2005 really kinda sucked a lot. It was a very trying year on my patience and I am glad that it is almost over! So rather than focus on how shitty this year was and how much I learned from all of the bad stuff (and I did learn a LOT), I am going to focus on how great the end of the year is shaping out for me! So I have to update now as I dont see myself having too much time to update in the next week.

- I have a new job that I see myself doing very well in and being very happy with what I do. And I would like to thank Chris and Jeff again for encouraging me to apply!
- John is coming home for good next week... So I wont have to go 3, 4 or sometimes 5 months before I am able to see him again. I simply have to wait a few days and I will have him here with me. I am so happy that I met him... I love him so much and an just ecstatic that he is coming home!
 
There is so much to look forward to next year and I just cant wait to get started. There is some drama going on because one of my friends decided that I am a "fake" friend... And I was a little upset about that... But I got over it... and I decided that even though its a day late and a dollar short for 2005, the year is ending in a bang! And I am not going to let one person screw that up for me.

So on that note-- MERRY CHRISTMAS TO EVERYONE! AND HAVE A KICK ASS NEW YEAR!! I LOVE YOU GUYS!
