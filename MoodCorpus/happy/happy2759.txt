It's a Hard Kock Life
Tonight Frank picked me up from my house and we walked through the park and up to 85th and west end to go to David's house in the blistering cold. We got there and so many people were there. I saw Arielle there! It was so exciting for me. The stuy girls (Anna, Ada, Lucy, Paloma, Martha, Roxie, Ellie)&nbsp;were there and the bronx science boys (Jordan, Josh, Danny, Ariel, Zack, Dashiell) were there and Kyle was there. Bronx science girls came (Erica Spiratos, Paris, and I think someone named Brielle). Then there were also Greg, ben Winston, Sam, Chris, and Jenna the girl I went to Marymount Drama Camp with. She's really nice. Oh and Matt Green was there! Weird I know. I smoked in the bathroom with Matt and Ben. Oh and some Stuy seniors were there like Emma, Mollie, Ben Howel, and a few of his friends that I don't know. David got us all out of the bathroom with a bat. He didn't want anyone smoking in the his house. He was high and not in a good mood tonight. Well I got really high and then Mari came with Anna, Maeve, Flavia, Nelly. I was just mingling and eveything and it was cool. I saw Kyle a few times and at one time he was on a bed with some girl from his school. 
Then everyone was leaving and I saw Kyle going out the door but I told him to stay. Then there was a huge mob going out of the door and I went into the living room. Kyle was back inside the house again and I guess he started talking to someone because he wasn't there when everyone was gone. Then the only people left were me, Arielle, Rach, Sam and David. Then Rachel tried going into the bathroom and found Frank in there. (He had thrown up earlier.) It was so funny. I checked the bathroom with Sam and Arielle and sure enough Frank was sitting on the toilet. So funny. This night was pretty good.
