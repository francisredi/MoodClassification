What this all is to me
Christmas is...

to me, a holiday that probably doesn't match much of anyone else's. This could be me celebrating the Solstice as much as anything else, except I LOVE the colored lights and the better quality Christmas carols :)  If I were raised Jewish, then perhaps it would be Hanuakkah, but it's not. But I was certainly not raised Christian either. Agnostic? Athiest? my idea of religion is my own. But Christmas?

To me, Christmas is made up of those I care for and the gifts I love to give.

That's it. Well, okay and lots and lots and lots of cookies. And some egg nog. And the smell of christmas trees.

Some rant about the mass commercialization of christmas. Color me blind, but I don't see it. Oh, there's more commercials out there than normal, but this is a consume-consume-consume society. It's no different this time of year than any other, except perhaps increased a notch. Doesn't matter to me. I try to block it out. I get gifts for people because I WANT to. Because sometimes I see something (like Beth's scrabble mug!) that has their name stamped all over it and I WANT to give it. I want to hear them laugh or smile or 'Oooo' in appreciation or glee or whatever it is. Or take silly photos playing with new gifts ;) (got 2 sets of those this year, SO cool!)

In a way, Christmas is thanksgiving. It's a 'thank you for being you'. Perfect, imperfect, amazing, flawed, everything together. Thank you for being you and having a part in my life in the past year --- and hopes for the best of the new year to come.

And so, the best sort of love to all this holiday season - no matter how you spend it, thank you and make the best of the new year.
