brrrr
I need to remember to bring blankets with me when I work at church on Saturdays. I keep forgetting and they don't heat the building on Saturdays cuz no one is here.... it gets really cold!
so LCT is over!! yay :-) the cast party was last night. Tech got invited so I decided to go to keep Chan company.. Duane tortured me by showing one of the DVD's from the show. I left early and went and helped Andrew pull up a bunch of lights back to the catwalk that were still down on the floor from LCT. Then we went down to Seattle and helped tear down an event AV pro was doing and then we went to the airport to meet Christine and Amanda. We got home SUPER late. I didn't get to bed till 3. So I got up around 10 and then went and dropped Chan off at work and then came to church. I finished a bunch of stuff for church tomorrow then I redecorated my cubbie. It's really cool now!! I took a bunch of christian artist posters and ripped the edges and hung them all over the wall and then I had a bunch of bad DVDs that I was going to throw away so I turned them backwards and hung them up. So it looks like I have CD's all over my wall. it's awesome! I've got about another half hour till Illuminate. Then after that I'm going to the Littell's till I have to pick up Chan from work. I get to work the Jump 5 concert on Monday! Not so excited about it being j5 but Duane is directing and I get to TD... so I'm excited about that! And I think It'll be good for me to work with Duane in a situation where we will both be able to have fun with what we are doing and it won't be stressful. Or at least I don't think it will be ;-) ya never know with all the pshyco road managers out there.

Anyways, I don't really know what else to say I'll be semi busy till Christmas but nothing too out of the ordinary :-)
have a good night!!
