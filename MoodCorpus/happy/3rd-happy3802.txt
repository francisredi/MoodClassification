MERRY CHRISTMAS!!
i haven't updated in forever.  i haven't really felt like i had much to write about. just the same old things happen ya know.
but i wanted to wish everyone a merry chirstmas and a happy new year because i will be in kentucky until jan. 1st.  i leave the day after christmas.  i am pretty excited and nervous cuz it will be weird because i don't know anyone but it should be good times.

last night i realized that i really do have the BEST friends in the world. and they are true friends. sure i haven't been really good about keeping in touch but that is just me i just don't like the phone and so i never call anyone. but you know you have TRUE friends whenever how ever much time you haven't seen each other when you hang out it is like you guys have been hanging out everyday.  i loved it. i hung out with cass jen and stac and we had a blast.  i think no matter what happens the four of us will always have a friendship together that is the greatest thing in the world because really nothing can change that not even time.  i am so glad that God blessed me with being able to grow up with those girls and making the best friends of my life.  maybe next time we won't leave such a large time gap of seeing each other.  i love them too much. 

i thank God for everything i am blessed with this year i have amazing friends and family.  sometimes i have doubts about everything but i have things good. and i am lucky.  

well this is all the update for now i need to get the house ready for everyone coming over today. love you all.  miss most of you.
