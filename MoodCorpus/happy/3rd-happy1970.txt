Pleasent Suprise.
I found out Organgeburg is a wireless city so I was able to get the internet up in TA's apartment.  I'm so happy because now I can use my computer here.
The trip up to SC was nice. It reminded me of being in the car with my mom before she got sick. I always liked long car rides because the landscape is so interesting and for the most part peaceful. It's the one time I'm for the most part silent.
Organgeburg reminds me of Thomson because of all the buildings and stuff. The end of Oz didn't have a lot of old buildings or a town square like Thomson's because it was a part of Metro-Atlanta but since Thomson and Orgnageburg aren't the metro's of any major city thy have a certain look to it.
Carmen is so cute. I love kids but at the same time I can't understand what she's saying sometimes(She's three with her own language.)but it's still fun to be around her.
I'm actually happy that I brought all my major stuff with me when I left JC's. I made sure I packed stuff after I used it and put all my bags next to the door. I didn't bring my lunch meat and cheese or bread (Which I never ate there.) because I wasn't sure if it would last on a two hour trip but I did bring my two packs of oatmeal.
I'm not in the Christmas spirit because a part of me realized one thing: It's bullshit to be an ass all year round and then good during Christmas. You should live with the ideals of Christmas all year round and not just becuase it's a day some white guy or whomever chose to celebrate Jesus' birth and give gifts. Be good to all men and not just because you feel the Christmas spirit but because most (I think child abusers are horrorible and certain crimes are just like Ugh, you are an ass and deserve to die. Well in the words of Pharrell "I never said I was an angel.") men deserve the goodness of mankind. 
Other than that I'm good.:)
