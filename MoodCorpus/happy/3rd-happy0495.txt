GO MOUNT UNION PURPLE RAIDERS!!!  HOOK 'EM HORNS!!
My Alma Mater, Mount Union College, plays at 11 today in the Division 3 College football playoffs for the 7th year in the last eight.  If they win, they will play in the Championships (called the Alonzo Stagg Bowl) for the National Division Three title, which they have won 7 of the last 8 years.  The coach is Larry Kehres, who was on campus when I was and was a stellar football player for Mount, then immediately went into coaching and worked his way up to Head Cocah.  He is the best Head Coach Mount Union has ever had and has raised the level of the program to incredible heights of success.  He is also a very good fellow and runs a very straight program.  Mount Union is a Methodist Conference School and is blessed with a gorgeous campus and (when I was there) a remarkably gifted, intelligent and caring faculty.  My memories of Professor Lyle Crist, Dr. Paul Chapman, Dr. Jerry Blount, Dr. James Rodman, Dr. John Saffel and Dr. Wesley Vesey are very precious to me.  GO MOUNT!!  We will watch the first hour in real time, then tape the rest and switch to the UT Mens' Basketball game at noon. [What can I tell ya, we bleed Burnt Orange!] :)  Claire is rushing over to join us, the cutie.  (Rushing as in hurrying to get here, not rushing as in football jargon, although if Mount doesn't gain as many yards rushing as she thinks apporpriate, she may do actual rushing as well!!)  :D

It was 39 degrees at 10am.  Seasonal for Christmas but the kittens are frankly disgruntled.  Larry says he is, too.  I am currently considering donning my long underwear that I bought for the Polar Bowl game in 1981. :)
