What a day!
Today was more like friday than hump day!! It snowed in the morning, just a light snowfall. But it was coming down at a consistant rate! By the time I finished cleaning one side of the car, the other already had a thin layer built up! People in the office were complaining about the snow for over an hour too. It was only a few centimeters of light snow. Heavy, wet snow would have been ALOT worse!

While I was working in the early morning, I had this nagging feeling I was missing something. Then I remembered!! I forgot to bring the tickets for Joanna!! I was supposed to meet her later to give them to her!! I instantly got anxious and upset. How could I forget?! I even reminded myself last nite, put them in your bag.. In a panic, I text'd Jo not to come but then I calmed down a bit to think of a plan of action. I decided to ask my dad to bring them to work for me and then meet Jo a bit later. It worked out! Met dad at 9:30, Jo at 10. Eric and I thought maybe Jo had time to chat but she was in a rush.

Barb C came in later and set up a some snacks at the front of the office. She brought in cake, cookies, assorted chocolates and rum cake! I had a slice of the rum cake and wow was it STRONG. I could smell rum and when I took a bite, the rum taste filled my mouth. It was good tho! Moist and heavy, with raisins and chocolate flavor. A few minutes after I felt a rush of blood to my head. It was like a drank a shot! That was some cake hahaha!

If there wasn't enough food yet, we also got a box of chocolates and a candy cane each, compliments of the company. I'll have to share the chocolates because some of them contain walnuts. Later Barb had cake and cookies for everyone at her farewell meeting. She was so humble and happy to be able to retire. I'm going to miss her sunny morning hellos.
