Thoughts on the Pelican and stuff that goes with...
There's how many weeks left until 12th Night?? I SO need to fly on beading my gown sleeves...

Yay! Himself got plaque belt, will look AWESOME with his new cioppa at 12th Night. Also got a couple medallions he ordered for us (extras, quite nice but simple). Plus, Drachenstein said our peerage collars were on the way as of yesterday... I SO can't wait to see them! Plus, Mark and Diane will bring my finished medallion (enamel done by Diane, custom silverwork by Mark) to me at 12th Night. Each piece we have will be treasured, and some will be passed on when the time comes. And you know, I am so dern excited about my Pel coat, too. Mom's making it just a simple later period black wool coat (will look spiff over Italians); I chose to forego a giant Pel marker on the back, and am having her do an embroidered Pel on the front left chest. Subtle. Himself's cloak will also have the Pel on the chest.

I'm very excited about family/ friends participating in our ceremony. We have Schwetzingen haus family members in the procession, we have the kidlets in it, we have dear Pel friends, I have my Laurel and my Pelican both in it, a good friend to herald it and another good friend to sing us in. Thank you all SO MUCH for being a part of this with us. It's going to be such an amazing weekend. Can't wait. I'm looking more forward to 12th Night than Christmas, I think. LOL.
