What a great weekend... so far
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I love visiting my family. I left Friday afternoon to go visit my Mom's side of the family. They live out by Lake Huron (about 2.5 hours drive). First thing we had to do was go pick up a present for my cousin Yvonne. I got her tea and she appeared to like it. We (my Mom and I) then went to the airport to pick up my cousin Bill, who had flown in from Winnipeg at noon that day. He was supposed to meet us in departures, but instead he was in arrivals, so it took awhile and a call on the airport intercom to find him. I did happen upon Sofia from school while I was looking for Bill. She was waiting to board her flight home to Brazil. Once we&nbsp;found Bill we got going pretty good. We stopped in Kitchener for dinner, and then after a bit on the highway the weather got really bad. By the time we arrived the weather was just horrible. I stayed at the farm with Bill's family. They had moved since the last time I had visited. My uncle John is now a poultry farmer instead of a dairy farmer, so I got to see lots of chickens instead of evil cows. In the morning Bill and I collected eggs, which was actually quite fun. They come up on a system of conveyor belts and we put them into carton-type things as fast as we could.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We normally have our family get-togethers at the farm, but since they moved there isn't enough room any more. So, this year we had it at a curling club. We got a couple of curling games going. It very fun. Most of us either hadn't played in a long time or had never played (we even got my brother to play!). Afterwards we exchanged gifts and then had a big delicious dinner. My Mom's stuffing was a big hit as usual. After dinner we put together a $5 poker game. My brother had the chip lead from pretty much the first hand until there was only three of us left. Then I took the lead from him and eventually won. I was quite proud of myself. On the way home we listened to my new Trews cd, which is very very good. I'm getting their other cd for Christmas, so I'm very good as far as music is concerned.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tommorrow, I study for my last exam this term, and then take the actual bloody thing at 7 pm. Afterwards I head straight out to Josh's house for his birthday/christmas/chanukkah party. Freedom from school should sink in by about Tuesday morning. Plans for the rest of the week include Christmas shopping and hanging out with as many people as I can.
