And I won't leave
Aloha, merry Christmas, all that jazz.

I'm at my mother's and all is going fairly well. She got me some clothes that I don't know about because I can't match clothes like most girls can, but she said she'll help me. My dad got me a sweatshirt, it was very nice of him. This Christmas was pretty sad at my dads house because my brother was the only one of the three of us who could afford to get nice gifts for us. It was great nonetheless because I think just hanging out with my dad and brother is something that I've missed a lot.
I wish money didn't exist. Bartering, that's what we should do.
Now my mom is making her waffles and I smell bacon too. Her boyfriend got me DaVinci Code, so I'll have something to read over break at least. That and V FOR VENDETTA!!! I'm on page 90 or something, and I really like it so far. I want to know what happened in room V!! So thank you Joe Vella for loaning that to me.

Something happening tonight at jv's? Sounds that way, someone call me or something.

As for me going to Chicago, I don't really feel like that's going to happen anymore. I've been thinking about it and I don't know if I ever want to be close to him again.

Hey Joe's online!

Merry Christmas everyone, and please try to enjoy your families and all their flaws, because that's what it's all about. Make the most of your time with them, you never know what could happen and you gotta love them even when you hate them.
