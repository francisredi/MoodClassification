A Good Christmas Laugh
My mom showed me this really hilarious Christmas newspaper clip. Here it is! I think it's absolutely hilarious, it reminds me of my family in Louisiana: 
Dear Annie: I've heard people complain about the overblown Christmas newsletters they receive.&nbsp; You know what I'm talking about - the husband got his third promotion, the son was offered a full scholarship to Harvard, the daughter was voted homecoming queen, the 9-year-old plays three musical instruments, the oldest daughter married an ambassador, the first grandchipd is a genius who already speaks three languages, and Grandma is embarrassed because she is so often mistaken for her daughter's older sister.&nbsp; So here's my Christmas Letter Revenge.&nbsp; I hope you will print it. --Had Enough of That
Dear Had Enough:&nbsp; Thanks for a good chuckle&nbsp; Here it is:
Dear Everybody:&nbsp; Once again, the happy holidays are upon us.&nbsp; We have so many things to appreciate.&nbsp; Bob got a promotion to french fry specialist at the fast-food joint, so we were able to purchase two more buckets at the flea market.&nbsp; We now have enough for all the holes in the leaking roof.&nbsp; We've actually collected so much water we can flush the toilets every day.&nbsp; The Feds found this year's marijuana crop before we could harvest it all, but we should make it through the winter with the profits from the still.&nbsp; Jimmy got out on good behavior just in time for Christmas and the birth of his fifth child.&nbsp; Fortunately, all four mothers have stopped fighting over him.&nbsp; Junior ran off again, and it gets harder and harder to get the sheriff to look for him.&nbsp; Just because he's 35 doesn't mean he can take care of himself.&nbsp; I hope the holidays find you whole and happy.&nbsp; I don't understand why the family reunion announcements again didn't reach us until after the event. - Bertha Mae, Bob, Jimmy, Junior and all the Grandkids.&nbsp; 
HAHAHA!&nbsp; I love it.&nbsp; 
Oh... and NO MORE CLASSES!!!!&nbsp; I'm so happy.&nbsp; Finals are over, praise the Lord.&nbsp; I've got some celebrating to do...
