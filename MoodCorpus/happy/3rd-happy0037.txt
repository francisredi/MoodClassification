ho ho ho mofos
Good morning all, just thought I would drop a quick line this moring before heading out on my christmas vacation of sorts. You gotta love the military it is so much like high school it's crazy, we get 2 weeks off for the holidays, and while I should be taking leave to go home and see the rents I am going to just chill again this yr. Dave is flying out on Sunday which is going to be fucking awesome, Emily doesn't believe me that my brother is like my best friend, boy is she gonna be in for a treat, sharing the house with the two of us MUAHAHAHAHAHA. Anyway, what has been happening in the life of Kyle lately? I went up and scoped out my new command in Maine, talk about beautiful, it is amazing up there and I can't wait to transfer up there, still no resolution as to whether or not Emily will be able to move up there with me, because Chief Rappa hasn't found out if I will even be able to live out in town or in the barracks. Emily and I have had our ups and downs lately, mostly ups but no relationship is perfect. On that note I have duty on XMAS day but alas I will be cooking up a feast on christmas eve for Dave, Emily and Joanna, we even have a tree with presents and stockings, the whole works, it's crazy. I am trying to play the scrooge as much as I can but we all know that I am just a big softy and can't wait to do the presents thing, it should be a lot of fun. Anyway I am at work and should get back to bullshitting with the guys before we bail out of here for the holidays...merry christmas to all and to all a goodnight.
