last day at work until next year!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
oh my god, i have all next week off.  i'm so excited.  i'm leaving early today.  there's only like 6 of us here.  i hate public holidays though coz the gym isn't open.  i'll have to go working, i mean walking.  but i'm going to go and get some personal training when it opens back up next wednesday.  hmmm, maybe "V" is a trainer.  but i wouldn't have him anyway coz i'd just laugh the whole time coz i'd be wondering if he's gay the whole time even though he's married, has an 18 month old kid and seems to always be chatting up chicks!!! go fugure.

we'll i gotta go.  i'm so happy about not having to work next week that i can hardly type!!!

peace out......

P.S i actually shouldn't be too excited about having next week off coz i don't qualify for rec leave yet so i had to take flexi's in advance, which means i have to make up the time after!! doh!  well i have over 11 hours already accumulated so i really only have to make up just over 11 hours.....only 11 at least, could be worse!!  it's only a day and a half.  i'll have to come in and start at 8.  oh yeah, and it also means i can't take a flexi after australia day!! oh my god.  But my supervisor did say that he's usually pretty flexible, so if i needed to take another one, it would just be more hours i'd have to make up!!!

anyway, i shouldn't have written that coz now i'm not so excited about having next week off!!
