Random Shit
K so i'm done most of the tests, I just have 1 major test (science biology) on thursday, but I'm not worried. Oh and today was kick ass!!!!! Kelly is funny stoned, and so is Susy. It was definaltely an honour that I could smoke Susy on her first joint since summer! Other than that, nothing much is new, Kyle called me to apologize for the shit he said to me (y'all should no, there's no sense in me repeating it) so lots ofthings with us is cleared up. 
OH KELLY YOU BITCH!!!!LOL! How could you say I'm an emo muffin?!!!!!! LOSER! Just because you are emo doesn't mean I am!! Awwww I luff you for it though. BUT I"M NOT EMO! You're the emo one in our lil group... got it? I don't think I'll give you your secret santa gift anymore (by the way I have you, but u already clued in once everyone else told you who they had). 
JJ it sooo awesome to see you and catch up! And I'm happy you liked your gift. But I'm sorry for being a bit "spacy and clueless" and I'm sorry if I complained like the whole time...... 
Anyway, I have to conclude this by saying KELLY IS A STUPID BITCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AND SHE'S THE EMO ONE! i'm the Alice Cooper fanatic! oh.... I'm in such a great mood!
Oh, 1 more thing, I'm happy my sis angie has found a new guy, who is much bigger than her ex, and would never lay a hand on her (or so he claims). Well see what happens.. bye bye for now!
