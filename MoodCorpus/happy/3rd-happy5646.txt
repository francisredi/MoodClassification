Christmastime was here, by golly
So here I am, back at work, after a very nice Christmas weekend.  Festivities started with  presenting me with an astounding and wonderful gift: a beautifully painted genuine Fender Stratocaster electric guitar, fulfilling my dream of owning a real Stratocaster, as opposed to the couple of Stratocaster knock-offs I've had over the years that just didn't sound right (and hence were traded in).  Our upstairs neighbors may not be happy, but I am.

Then  and I made the trek out to Western Mass to see my family.  I hadn't been out there since my injury over the summer, and it was great to see my very small but close-knit family again.  We stayed at my mom and stepfather's house in Amherst, with my crazy (crazy in an awesome way, that is) aunt visiting as well.  We also managed to drive up to my dad and stepmother's place in the middle of nowhere up in the hilltowns.  Gifts were exchanged, dinners were eaten, I found out that drinking a pint of fairly potent beer after not having alcohol for six months will hit you pretty hard, and a good time was had by all.

Oh, and we got to see the French version of March of the Penguins, which is quite different from the American version.  The French version is narrated by the penguins themselves (voiced by actors), has a number of original French-style pop songs, and is generally quite different from the American version.  Recommended.

On Monday, we reluctantly said goodbye and headed back to the city.  Next up on the agenda is having 's family over for a belated Christmas celebration next weekend!  Now to figure out how to fit seven people into our apartment...
