I'm dreaming of a white christmas
I'm dreaming of a white christmas, as it's not happening here this year. Blame the Chinook that's blown its way across the mountains. That said, chinooks make for some very striking skies (both colours and clouds). I guess that's something.

Nevertheless, all is well. I always find it a bit strange to be in Alberta, as even though my family now lives here, I never have (my dad's job moved after I left home). I'm from the east, and even though I lived in central Canada for a few years, the west is always an interesting place to be. The history here is so recent (the province was only 100 years old this year) and it still has a frontier spirit (of sorts). The politics here mostly err towards the small-c conservative (however that said, the Green Party polls well out here - go figure!), but I find the people are really friendly and welcoming, including the shop assistants! It's always a bit of an adventure for me and I do find new things to explore. For example (among other things), I've been vintage clothes shopping, got lost trying to find a hospital (the Calgary grid system saved me though!), rode the c-train (the city's light rail transit system), tromped around Heritage Park (which was all done up for Christmas!) and rambled around the foothills with the dogs. It's been nice.

Today, I have some last minute things to pick up at the shops, must wrap my presents, and finish some baking (so far I've made shortbread, mince pies, mincemeat bars and stollen). I may even get some knitting in later on - my mum's going to show me a few tricks.

I hope that whatever everyone's doing the next few days (whether or not you celebrate Christmas) you have a wonderful holiday!! xx
