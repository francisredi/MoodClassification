My intresting day on Thursday
okay so my day started off early by getting up at 6am and going to the gym and working out for two hours, man I loved it, but I forgot to bring my work clothes which was a bummer, but I decided to swing by after class to change. So I go to school find out that I have an A in my Poli Sci class which Im not suprised cuz I love that class. Then I met up with my group members for a quick run through of it. Then I found out one of my group memebers could give me the hook up at D&B cuz they work there which is nice so tomorrow all the girls are going out to D&B :). Also in class while we were giving a presentation, while julanna was talking ryan was trying to get me to laugh and it was sooo hard not to. And when Ryan was talking LJ was making funny faces at me which was horrible cuz I couldnt stop smiling. but I think we did a good job and then after we went Ryan and I couldnt stop talking we even got yelled at to shut up so the other group could present, and when they did theres was on humor and each time we watched a clip of a tv show or skit he would make these extra comments and I swear for the hour and what ever time we have in that class I couldnt keep a straight face, and then afterwards LJ told me that he would take me for a ride on his bike and I couldnt pass that up so I did that today. And Ryan walked me out to my car after class which I thought was soo cute, I raced home changed and got to work and I enjoyed working cuz "THE SHARK" wasnt there and when it slowed down all we did was goof around. It seemed that I was laughing most of my day and it was great I couldnt of been more happier. Well I am going to go to bed now cuz Im going to the gym tomorrow and honestly I can see my body toning up especially since I go almost everyday :)
