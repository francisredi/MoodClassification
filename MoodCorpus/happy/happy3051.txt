Why, 'cause this guy beat up Mal? That ain't so hard.
I've decided to start sharing a few episodes of Two Guys and a Girl via my LJ.   has got seasons 2-4 and has been sending them to me so I figured, hell, might as well share them with the world.  I figure fans of Nathan Fillion's will be interested to see the episodes and, hell, seeing them will help um, readers enjoy my fic more! See, I'm cunning that way. Fear me! *flex*  Anyway, there's nothing I'm ashamed about in promoting this show. It's quite hilarious.

Nathan's character, Johnny, doesn't show up until season two.  He was supposed to be just a minor reoccuring character but by season three he was regular of the show.  However, as a result, in his first few episodes he's got a much smaller role and is a little different than how he is later in the show.  (He starts out as a typical handsome and nice layman, and later becomes this adorable and sweet lovable guy . . . hahaha.) Anyway, I decided to upload his first three episodes (he wasn't in all of season two consecutively).  They're up via YSI so if they die, please let me know and I'll reupload them for you guys. :) 

Please enjoy and let me know if you're downloading, just so I know how far this is reaching!  Power to the sitcom! Ha!

In totally unrelated news, I rewatched the scene from Serenity that my quote comes from.  Man.  That scene is just so fabulous.  It's just tense and poignant and shows that Jayne knows exactly what he's doing when he says what he says.  Someone needs to provide me with make-up sex between them, directly related to this scene.  Lalalalaa. GO AWAY PLOT BUNNIES.  Hound someone else, someone NOT ME.
