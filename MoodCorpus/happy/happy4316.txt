Frequenting the Park at Dawn
So at 05H30 I headed off to Memorial Park to hide. Alas, I made the mistake of having Alucien on while I hid in the tree and didn't notice until too late when Vash appeared beneath me.

Since I've given the time I left, I've only just got back. The time is now 08H46. Although I wasn't fretting, I was wandering how I would explain me getting back in so early in the morning, in my black jacket, covered in dirt. (And get your mind out of the gutter! Nothing dodgy happened!) Excuses ranged from not being able to sleep and walking it off, to going to the shop but realising I'd forgotten my wallet and dirt, what dirt?

Luck was on my side as everyone sans Dylana were in their rooms, probably still asleep. Thank Goodness! I mean, sure I'm 18 and all, but sneaking off before dawn with a guy much older than me (and no-one knows about Vash to begin with) just calls for questions.

:)

All I can say is that we have similar sized hands, except his fingers are bigger than mine. They're also much warmer than my cold-coated ones were. And my left leg is really not thanking me for my numerous descents down the dew-coated, wet slide. Hm.

Life is bright, indeed. Except for Voice and its visions of snogging and jumping. Egads! But now, I must rejuvenate myself as my sugar high is definitely wearing down now...
