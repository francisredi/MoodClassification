weekend finally
what a long week. insanely long dress rehearsals, work, the holiday concert getting postponed to monday, skipping class to go to band (and getting a cut slip from gym, haha), etc.however, last night was fun. after school i went to jess's house and she, maya, and i went to friday's for dinner and then drove to west windsor to meet her governor's school friends. they were all really nice and really smart. there were thirty people there and four of them were going to harvard. a little scary. haha. after a few hours we went back to jess's house and stayed awake long enough to watch love actually (awesome movie to watch this time of year-actually, any time of year but this one especially), then fell asleep. and whoa, a bigggg congratulations to everyone who got into college this week. yay!some of my favorite moments from this week: -going to all three band classes on thursday-when christie and i were lying on the band room floor and she said "let's roll on the floor! go left first!" and i felt like&nbsp;a five-year-old but in such a good way. haha. -what i learned at acme on wednesday night: there are 8 oz in a cup. in 18 days i can buy not only cigarettes and lottery tickets, but krazy glue. not eating for 11 hours is bad.-homeroom. it just rocks. lol. 
and now for the annual christmas shopping trip with stacy and ramya! yay!
