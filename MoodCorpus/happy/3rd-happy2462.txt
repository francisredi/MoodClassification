Busy busy busy! 3 days!
Holy shit man. My house has been pure chaos since I came home. I have been helping my parents this whole weekend. We wanna be pure done the basement and also have the house spotless (u know my mom)&nbsp;when Diogo gets here so that his room can be ready. Today I wrapped all the presents (which was ALOT) (and usually my dad does it). Like, my hands hurt. I was dying. Wow i really sucked ass but I learned. You could tell which one's were the first couple that I wrapped cause they look like complete SHIT lmfao. Man. Then the last ones are sooo hot. Wow practice makes perfect! So tommorow we are doing the guest bedroom and it's gonna look sooo cute. I love it already haha. And we are also doing the new comp room ,waoooww guys! Sorry if&nbsp;I dont have the internet for a couple hours namurhahaha.
Today was friggen classic. My brother has this huge Portugal flag and he wanted to put it on the ceiling of his room. Classic times of my life. It took is like 7 tries, literally. We kept getting it upside down or inside out, cause its friggen huge right, it's so hard to see. Then my mom is crying she's laughing so hard from my room cause she was clearing all the shit they had in there. K did i tell u? I come home on Thursday and my room has boxes, presents, shit everywhere! Like i couldnt see my bed or my floor. So i had to sleep with my brother or the couch, lmao. It was classic. Anyways it's almost done. So yeah my brother's room looks pimpppppp.
What else? Man I don't even know. I didn't go out this weekend but it was sooo classic needless to say. My family has me in tears. Like, I love them so much, toooo funny. Such a great time. Especially when we are on a tight schedule. Well, I gotta go! Love yas!
