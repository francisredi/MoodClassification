the real thing.
Gosh. You know how you feel when you work really hard and get some opportunity you really want or do something really well, and it's just really exciting and you're proud and happy and the world is all good??

Well, I haven't had that feeling in a while, personally. But I felt like that vicariously through today. Lots o' people I know were in a wonderful play tonight. Rachie directed, Jenn starred in it, and Jenny was the stage manager (shafer represent like whoa!). And I was happy and proud that I know such wonderful, talented people! :)

And then Greg got offered a co-op for Honda, which he doesn't know if it's entirely feasible yet, but it's still an opportunity. (hahaha. the irony is that he 1) prefers american cars and 2) he detests the honda element). In find this funny. But, I'm really happy for him, cuz he works really hard and is brilliant, and he totally deserves an awesome opportunity, and I'm excited and proud. :)

Anyone remember when i told everyone that my little sister was prettier than their little sister? Well, it's like that. My almost-boyfriend is more brilliant and amazing than yours, so there :P My friends are more talented and exciting than yours, so there :P
Actually, I guess we can compromise cuz I'm sure y'all have amazing younger sisters/men/friends. Maybe they can be equally as wonderful as mine. :)
