First of December
Gosh, it's December already.  I really can't wait till Christmas.  I have one more week of classes afther this week then finals.  I have 5 finals during finals week. I think that's the most ever.  That's what happens when you have 20 hours I guess.  I am done on December 15, which is exciting.  Then I have one day off and then I start working, which I am actually excited about because I absolutely love working, well during the week anyways.  I don't absolutely love getting up early and dealing with the stress of it that comes with the holidays, but I will get to see all my friends at work now. I am also extremely excited because I got John tickets to the Duke-Clemson game on Jan. 14 and this is probably the most exciting thing I will ever go to to to date.  I mean, Duke is the number one team in the country.  Oh and the prospect of seeing J.J. Reddick even from the cheap seats is enough to get any girl excited.  Heh. 

Really I have a lot of projects to do before finals, but nothing I can't handle.  I have one page left of my sonata to memorize but I am being a procrastinator as usual and not doing it.  Oh and 2 weeks ago we went to see HP and the Goblet of Fire and it was THE best HP movie to date.  GOF is my favorite book anyway it and was just awesome.  And happily the music was good too.  I bought the soundtrack last night and it's fabulous.  I hope all of you are going well during this busy finals and Christmas season.
