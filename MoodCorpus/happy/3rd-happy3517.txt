All I want for Christmas...
Well, I've got my new and improved ladybits! Yeah! Surgery wasn't that bad, they knocked me out and I woke up in recovery. I peed and went home. With good drugs. The only downside was that no one told me I couldn't breastfeed if I had general anesthesia, so baby had to have formula for 24 hours. Oh well. I feel so much better than when baby was born. I feel like I did 6 weeks after she was born. So basically the OB really fucked up when he sewed me up the first time. I just can't believe I can sit on the toilet with no pain! Too much information, I know, but I'm chuffed. And only 4 weeks until funky dirty lovin', YES!

Bought Christmas presents for the husband, can't tell yoose guys yet because I think he reads this....he said he bought my present in Fall River, but what the hell is in Fall River? The outlets? Did he buy me discount curtains? Or maybe socks? I don't know! I love Christmas! We bought baby this soft keyboard thingie she can kick to make music or we can lay her on it to let her play it with her hands. It lights up and plays music. She'll love it, she's a wicked kicker. I ask her to dance for me and she kicks and kicks and punches the air. Oh, and found out today she likes, no loves, hip-hop and r&b music. Neither the husband nor I really listen to that kind of music, but she loves it?! Weird!

Well enough for now, love you beetches!
And I love my new ladybits!
