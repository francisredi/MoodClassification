Making my heart feel better
Aunt G. is awful, and I was up late because I was so upset about what happened last night.&nbsp; This morning, only a few hours after I'd actually managed to get to sleep, my phone rang.&nbsp; I didn't want to get out of bed, but I was curious to see who'd called me, so I went to check my caller ID and see who'd called, and once I saw the number, I knew that this was the way of the powers-that-be making me feel better.
It was my bestest friend in the whole wide world.&nbsp; We'd been out of touch for months, as life goes sometimes for us, but I called her back and hearing her voice truly made my heart more whole.&nbsp; We caught up, and she told me about her new job, new boyfriend who loves her very much and even gave her a promise ring!&nbsp; (We always joked that she'd get married before me, even though I always had boyfriends or just men, and one of our inside jokes is that when I talk about a new guy, she starts singing the chorus of "Maneater" by Hall and Oates.&nbsp; Makes us laugh every time, has since high school!).&nbsp; I caught her up on family, and job doings, and we discussed how excited we are that her cousin is finally pregnant after years of trying.
Even though I know things deep down in my heart, sometimes, like everyone does, I need a reminder.&nbsp; She called at just the right time, she's always known how to do that.&nbsp; I'm glad.&nbsp; 
And I feel a lot more settled inside.
