My life is Happy again :-)
I am pretty much all better, school is getting under control, and this weekend looks like it is going to be lovingly busy!!! Friday (or tomorrow) I have pretty much triples to get done, which i will accomplish so that i can have wonderful, peaceful weekend void of unfinished-school guilt :-) Friday night is practice when i get to see everybody and play volleyball 100% again which will make me very happy!
 Saturday, i am hearing rumors of a basketball tournament with teams i know. I am so there :-) I love basketball!! not to mention my team is playing. I used to call them my boys, and considering i still know everyone on the team (pretty much) i guess i still can, so i'm going to watch my boys play. Something i'm happy about because this year the volleyball games are played at the exact same time as the basketball which means i won't see pretty much all their games this year. so yeah that's why the tournament excites me.
 Then saturday night i am finally going to be in the Homer church walk :-) I can't wait it will be tons of fun (thanks Lace!) 
 Sunday is a movie with Lauren :-D which will be tons of fun, still some bugs to work out because the stupid NCG theatre doesn't play Pride and Prejudice, but it will still be fun. Then Sunday night Homer Church Walk again, maybe depending on how late the movie goes :-)
 All this adds up to one awesomely fun weekend! Yay to not being sick!!! :-D
