Big grin
These kids are great - I don't know what it is today, but I'm jsut happy to be around them.  Of late, I've been very put off by the clingy behavior and rapidly growing irritated when a kid plunks down in my lap every time I sit still.  Might be the fact that they napped until almost 5 today or that they're just in good moods or that I'm going on break from work for a week plus, but whatever it is, I like it.

Wise words from my lady-wife last night about my Christmas expectations.  They probably will be too wired to really settle into it - there will be fights and time-outs.  They're only 4 and 2 after all, and P-nut is going to be overwhelmed from the get-go.  Still, I think it'll be fun and I'm looking very much forward to it.  I'll jsut amend my idealistic vision to more in line with "A Christmas Story" versus some Dickensonian fable...:)  Ah well - the joys of kids.

Tomorrow, brief time at work - just long enough to check mail and get my PT in, then a stop by Publix on the way home.  Then I finally get to take time off to do something with my family, which I hope goes well.  We'll see - either way, it's better than being at work.  And hey, my wife is happy with me again, so that's probably a huge factor in my own good mood.  I didn't realize how all-pervading nor how long-standing that anger was until I actually HEARD her say it.  Now I'm just sort of stunned that she hadn't smothered me with a pillow before now.  Thank goodness for overriding love.
