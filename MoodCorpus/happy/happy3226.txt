Oh boy! I should be studyin' but oops... 
So over winter break it's usually a time to see old friends, relax, and enjoy yourself... correct? Well, I will mos. def' enjoy myself but jeepers am I busy! 
I get home either 16th or 17th.
The 18th is my mom's side of the family christmas celebration. 
I work ten days of the next two weeks - including christmas eve! Then I also have to shadow teach meaning I have to go in and be with a teacher (my mom ^.^) for five days).

The best part comes in Jan....
I work one day. Then I go on a ROAD TRIP! Derek, Eric, Kip and I are going on a massive road trip for 9 or so days! We start either on the first or second (haven't decided yet). If we leave on the first we'll go up to Dave Giffords house for a day before going on the team trip to Maplelag. Then from there we're driving up to watch the highschoolers race at Mesabi (possibly staying with our old teams or in the car), then we are going up to Kips cabin for a night before we head up to Telemark.  We're meeting the rest of our relay at Kips cabin then going to the 24hr ski relay race, then back to Kips cabin for the remainder of the weekend!!! 

How this will work... no idea. But, Derek said that we have use of his minivan. Life is good.  Even if this grand plan doesn't work, it's going to be one awesome break!

MUCH LOVE TO EVERYONE! ITS ALMOST BREAK TIME!!!
