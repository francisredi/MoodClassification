On 'The Christmas Invasion'
It reminded me of Independence Day, only the British were the heroes... well them and that really handsome man in the pyjamas! XD

On the whole, I'm sold on the David Tennant era! It was an absolutely fantastic way to kick it off! Again I have to praise the budget, it looks like the best thing that this country has produced in years and the Sycorax were awesome, so fingers crossed they'll be back at some point! ^_^



Yay for Torchwood but double yay for the return of UNIT from the classic series! XD

I NEED to see that series preview again! There was so much that just looked so great! The return of Sarah Jane, the return of K9, the return of the Cybermen and all of the new enemies look incredible! ^_^ If anyone comes across a download for it before I do or before the torrents are up, send it my way! ^_^

If I have one complaint, the Doctor was out of it for too long. I mean, yay for David Tennant and Billie Piper is still the most improved actress in the universe AND I know that its part and parcel of regeneration (but then I *HATED* Castrovalva when I saw it way back when) but it's still annoying when the protagonist is pretty much a non-factor for most of the episode ^_^;;



In the end though, it was more good than bad! Everything looked brilliant, everyone acted brilliantly and the the new series should be nothing short of un-freaking-believable!

And now I have to wait for the Spring to watch it.

Now *I* need a TARDIS! XD

Take care,
