xmas has started.
&nbsp;
 Here I am on a thursday afternoon and I am so not at work, we were not ment to finish work til tomorrow but my bosses didnt take in account the fact that our&nbsp;supplier had already finish for the holidays, so about yesterday lunch time we came to a stand still. so after lunch my boss came around with a pile of forms and said we could either tke 2 days unpaid leave or come in a paint the floors. I have never taken a form the quick ever. we have sent the last week of so saying there was no way we were going to get everything done on xmas eve so most didnt mind the fact we are losing 2 days pay. what we dont have we dont spend.
went out around my friends last night and it was 2 groups from church were meeting up, we did a secret santa, I got my friend a chocolate cook book , which wasnt what I wanted to get her but but she seemed to totally loved it, I got a tape player, I dont have a stereo player anymore and our church records the meetings so if you miss one you can still hear it. and I am always bitching I cant get them so someone out there was listening. it was a fun night too, I dont really know the people in the other group, interesting group, I wouldnt like to be&nbsp; around them too much but for one night it was fun.
And tonight a few of us are going down the pub, it will be just girlies so should be fun, and Im out to dinner too&nbsp; so nice relaxful night I am looking forward to. 
Oh and I managed to do something with my mood thream it is very basic as I did the one via here but it seems to be working, as some point I will try and sort out a better one but me and it do not get on so am glad I managed to get something up.
