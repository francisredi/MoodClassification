five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes / how do you measure, measure a year?
johnny came over last night.  he treated us to a bunch of alcohol, and we all watched how the grinch stole christmas and then horton hears a who!, which was a bonus feature on the VHS version i bought.  we all agreed that whoever directed horton hears a who! was on acid, which is saying a lot, because we were all very intoxicated.

you know, it was the first time i've gotten drunk since halloween.  only took three smirnoff twisted black cherries.  sad.

after that, johnny and i played teenage mutant ninja turtles: turtles in time on my super nintendo.  it was a lot of fun.

well, today, i cleaned my room.  i even cleaned out my closet.  i brought my bike upstairs, because there's no way i'm leaving it outside for a month while i'm gone.  i'm so paranoid, i'm even gonna lock it to the fireplace grate, just to be on the safe side.  i'll be taking all my computer stuff home with me, because God knows i can't be seperated from my computer for very long.

anyway, i've already set a pile aside of stuff i'm taking home with me.  so i'm partially packed.

after erin's exam, we went over kat and kate's and watched white christmas with kat, allie, and emily.  it was good times, and we all sang along to all the songs.  (except for erin, who had never seen it before).

tomorrow, erin and i are gonna go see rent, and then i'm gonna study a lot.  hooray for exams.  hah!  joking.
