Christmas :D
Yay! Christmas rocked! My "big" gift is my parents helping me get my car fixed cause the brakes are going bad. However, my mom still gave me some stuff. Heres what I got:

Snoopy & Woodstock Watch (ITS SO CUTE!)
Aquarium for my hermit crab (and I may get a few more now that I have a nice big space for them)
Snoopy christmas ornament that I can have for my new apartment!
Snoopy socks
Monkey slippers, complete with legs and arms haha, CUTE!
Jack Russell puppy purse, I got the wallet a while back ago but the purse was kind of expensive so my mom got it :) 

I got 50 bucks from my grandma, and money from my mom's side of the family too. Yay! So now I'm good to go, I will definitely have money for books and everything, cause now that I'm getting paid $9.25 an hour at Kroger, and pulling 22-32 hours I'll be loaded up by the time RA training rolls around again. I am pretty optimistic, I feel a lot better about going back to Walters. I'm going to try really hard this year to be a good RA, and also make time to hang out with my friends and relax a little bit so I'm not as stressed out as last semester. I know I can pull of the grades, so no need for stress :) 

Also, Amanda and I went to look at apartments again and I think we're pretty set on wanting to live in the Paddock Apartments complex. $555 a month for a 2 Bedroom Apt. that is 1080 sq. ft. and has all utilities paid (OMFG YES!). The people are soo friendly and there is only a $100 security deposit, pets are allowed if we ever want one and Amanda is close to school and if I transfer to a Kroger in Lex. there is 2 Krogers right down the road!! :) Very excited about this, it's getting so close! It's finally starting to feel real :)
