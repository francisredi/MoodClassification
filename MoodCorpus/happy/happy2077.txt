whores.
i hate whores, like most people would. but i especially hate the ones that will go after a guy ONLY because he has a girlfriend. she could know him since 7th grade, be friends with him, but not find ANY interest until he gets a girlfriend. and right after that happens, she starts calling him because shes "bored" and all that shit and leaving messages on his machine. its such bullshit, likes its a game to them, the thrill of the catch right? and now that she realized that she has no chance of THIS BOYFRIEND leaving his girlfriend, she moved onto some other innocent girl. yea sure i'm glad to have her out of my hair but ever since she found out that naturally i can't stand her, she LOVES to say hi to him and stuff only when i'm around. but i am truly blessed, because he doesn't like it. and thats why i love him SOOO much, because he sees what shes doing. and i'm glad she got shot down, because her conceeded self sees she can't have everything she wants, and shes not as cool as she thinks she is. 

in other news, erik took me on a fantastic date last night! its was soooo amazingly good. we went for sushi and went to the falls and were guna see a movie but it was sold out so we walked around and looked at stores and stuff and got a free crepe, and one we bought. lol they messed up on someone's crepe by forgetting to take out the lettuce and tomatoes and she's like "anyone want a free crepe?" so we flew over there and got it. it was awesome. and then we left and everything rawked. <3
