been working-
just started a big paint job in brooklyn, and it is not near a subway so we have been driving to the job, which is kinda fun... and kinda not. i don't enjoy this work and hope not to have to do it anymore someday, but i pay myself well, set my own hours and schedule, and the reward of seeing it finished in the end is nice. and, well, without this work, i would be a literal starving artist. at least now i can make some money and then use it to make some art.

speaking of art...

i am working on the pre-production stuff for my short film- The Socks.
shooting a film is a lot like making a jigsaw puzzle: you paint the picture/write the story - then cut it up into pieces/divide it up based on locations, time of day, and interior or exterior -  then shoot the film in non-sequential order - and then piece it back together in the editing... wha la, you have a jigsaw puzzle/movie!

i also recently got my notification that i got a grant to produce some new  photography works and then show them in the spring at the alice austin house museum. 
i've decided to combine both the new pieces and some old pieces to make it a retrospective kind of show. i've been working in the medium for 20yrs. now so i have many subjects and contents to pull from.
i'm very excited, it's been years since i've had my own show, and it will give me a chance to look back and see my life objectively.

things with sean are very good. i'm the luckiest man alive, i think.
