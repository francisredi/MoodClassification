Festivus
Tomorrow is Festivus.  Well, at least the generally accepted Festivus celebration date.  I didn't know this until I read the Wikipedia article on Festivus.  The date is funny to me because just last night I was explaining to John and Zack that my two favorite holidays are Thanksgiving-eve and Christmas-eve-eve.  They didn't really ask why but, the reasons these days are my favorite is because they aren't real holidays.  They're just fun -- like Festivus.

Anyway, Festivus...er...Christmas-eve-eve....er....Friday is quick approaching and I'd like to celebrate.  I know that I'm departing from the traditional Festivus celebration but, I just like to go out to a mostly empty bar with some friends.  This is the tradition that my roommates and I have been engaging in for the last couple of years and it's a lot of fun.  Empty bars are easy to find in Lawrence over the holiday because the bar-to-person ratio is extremely high without most of the students in town.  If you'd like to celebrate Friday (Frestivus or whatever), drop me a line, leave me a message, a comment -- just get in touch.

On a somewhat related note, if you look at the External Links section of the Wikipedia article on Festivus you'll notice a like to a Lawrence Journal-World article on Festivus.  I just thought that it was interesting that a LJW article was linked to a Wikipedia article and that you might like to know.
