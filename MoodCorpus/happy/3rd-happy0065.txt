Ape Beat Chest.  Ape Love Woman.  Ape Fall Off Building.  The End.
King Kong was great but you must see it in the theatres.  I may never watch it again (it's one of THOSE movies) but it was awesome and wall shaking and (loose comparison coming here) it was the length of movie that Harry Potter should have been because I actually FELT for the characters in the film.  Naomi Watts was beautiful and really was all they said she was.  It was an awesome Thursday afternoon event.  

But that's not the story.

The story was when we sat down in the back row of the movie a woman came over and asked us to watch her (looked about 5 years old) daughter while she ran out to the concession stand.  We said sure.  Then we looked over.  Honest to Oz, it was a mini version of  sitting there, all engaged in the previews but not in a wide-eyed child way but more of a "Hmmm....They remade "The Posiedon Adventure?"  I hope it's not all fake and stuff" look on her face.  She sat through the whole 3 hour movie with nary a word and clapped here and there.  I created a whole story in my mind that she was some sort of theatrical genius (sort of a Mozart of movies) and that her mom does the only thing she can do which is to take her to every single one.  :-D

Anyway, we were fully enthused.

Later, at BWW, a man asked us to watch his seat at the bar and his 3/4 full beer.

We decided we must look trustworthy if people kept asking us to watch things that were so important to them.  :-)
