you were the best platform from which to jump beyond myself
When I was younger I used to watch Disney movies and read fairy tales. I was a shy child so that was how I spent most of my free time while my classmates were off playing at each others houses. I always wanted to be the heroine, the one who was saved by the prince in the nick of time but could take care of herself at the same time if she needed to. For most of my life since then I've tried to be the self-sufficient, independent woman, because I didn't want to depend on people to take care of me. And most of the time, I did a fairly decent job of it, but a part of me was still the little girl who wanted to live out a fairy tale.

Now that I am, I don't know quite how to handle it. He tells me I'm beautiful whenever he gets the chance and makes me feel like I'm being worshiped, as egotistical or weird as that sounds. It's not that I don't appriciate it, but I don't know if I can live up to those expectations. I feel like I should be trying to make him laugh and smile and be cute for him and at the same time I don't think that I've ever felt this comfortable around anyone else. I feel like a more enhanced version of myself when I'm with him, like I'm feeling things more intensely. Like my heart is moving too fast for my brain to keep up with, and I end up getting tongue-tied and repeating what he's said to me  back to him because I don't know how to word how I feel about him any better than the way he did.

The holidays are coming up even faster than I realized and I still have no idea what to get anyone. I already knew I was a bad procrastinator, but this is a little ridiculous.
