she fuckin hates me...lalalalaa...
i am a nervous wreck.  i dont know if he was kidding or not, but i really hope he was.  Matt called me tonight while i was at loris house. i pick up and hes like "have you seen bryant? i was supposed to hang out with him and i dont know where he is and he isnt picking up his cellphone." so i absolutly freak out and i call bryant, he didnt answer me, i call matt back and tell him that and tell him to keep calling bryant. so i call bryant back a little while later, he picked up.  he was an sbsolute wreck, on god knows what.  i was litterally scared out of my mind, every thought that i could possibly think was racing through my mind. so i call matt back after i talk to bryant and matts like, "but i talked to him a half hour ago..."  but you know how quickly that ish kicks in. i was so scared.  i asked matt to call him back, maybe go try and find him or something and call me back. that was like an hour and a half ago, and i am absolutly freaking, i am praying tmo god that bryant is okay. if he isnt i really dont know what i would do. i love that boy, i love him more than life, if he were hurt or anything, i know i would be a wreck and somehow feel rediculously guilty for it.  i know its not my fault but i just love him so goddamn much. i cant help it. oh god, please let him be alright, please!!!!

later. with updates.
