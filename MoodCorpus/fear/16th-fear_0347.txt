I have returned with the most emo journal entry ever
It's been a long time since I've been on here, but it's stupid to apologize. I've never been spectacular at keeping journals. right now I feel like someone has thrown my emotions and my logic into a blender and pressed the crushed ice button. I'm really afraid I'm just going to shut off and stop trying, which will ruin my chances in a lot of respects. I thank God for the friends I do have, because they've helped me to keep my sanity, and have put up with my bullshit for longer than they've every had to, I think. I'm finding it increasingly hard to step back and see the bigger picture, which I used to be able to do. inadequacy has been a reoccurring theme lately, and I can barely look my teachers in the eye for fear of them seeing the mediocre person that I am. I wish with all my being that I didn't really feel this way. when I read this I can't help but cringe at what a cliche I've become, but sometimes I just can't help it.
