after the doc...
ok so I went to the doc. and he began by saying wow scoliosis is pretty bad, your spine disappears! then tells me the things I know... knocked knees and flat feet. yup I said, then to tell me the lump is a herniated disk caused a fluid sack witch pinched a nerve...so on Apr.4 th. I go for a real time image x-ray procedure the needle will inject illuminating fluid to see it, and allow them to create a pocket around the damaged nerves... sounds cool! They also told me because of my tendency to dislocate my shoulders I will have to have surgery to permanently relocate them! eventually, one thing at a time, I guess all these years of extreme flexibility have taken a heavy tole on my bod, so the procedure on the 4 th. has a fifty/fifty chance of working if not we try something else!  I guess I am nervous but not too bad at the moment this doc. seems to know his stuff.mean while no pain meds. and I suffer!
