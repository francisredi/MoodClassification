OMFG FIRE!!!!!
Yeah, so you know what's fun? Sitting in your room, in your pjs and hanging out round midnight, then hearing someone banging on the door to beat gunfire. Just as you're wondering what you could have done to warrant such rude and violent noise, you hear a voice shout, "Is anyone in there?". And when you answer yes, they say, "Get out of the building right now - THERE'S A FIRE ON THE SIXTH FLOOR!"

Just so you know, I'm on the first floor, so Kelsey and I were nice and far away from it. The students were good, all sounding the alarm and letting each other know (this was way before the fire trucks came, so we really are a good caring group of people). And we all waited in the aprking lot, and then the sports center, while the good firemen did their jobs. People were standed outside in various states of dress - some had no shoes, others were in bathrobes. Kelsey was wearing her backless slippers. I was in my pjs, coat and boots. We got to go back pretty fast since we don't live on the sixth floor.

But whoa. I just wanna know who left their fucking casserole on.

Completely OT: I think I wanna get a paid account. Because lj mood themes suck. I want my own.
