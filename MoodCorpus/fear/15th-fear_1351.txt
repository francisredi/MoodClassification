newwie..
I'm a newwie to this site. I find myself signing up for a bunch of stuff that I don't really need to half. Ior instance livejournal. I have an xanga so I dunno why I made an LJ account but seems pretty gosh darn cool. :P I got confused at first but it's growing on me. 

I feel so nervouse right now for some reason. It feels like something big's gonna happen.. I feel all shaky and just really really nervous.. Lolz M-vic actually got me the dogtag I asked for. I was keeding though I wasn't expecting it. I'm crossing the street and I just see him giving me something and I take it and I'm wondering wth it is he gave me. Then I remember turn around but he's gone. Woah. Mr.Shawty cheer up doode ^-^ Gotzta put a smile on. :) So.. happenings.. English class: watched X-Men. French class: watched Beauty and the Beast Disney version. Art class: Calligraphy name thingy. Religion class: watched Fantasia then fell asleep. Boring day =\ But I liked watching X-Men :P Nyways soo yah... =\??
