oscars and lost
i've a list in mind. consists of four words: oscars, lost, portfolio and jobs. but my plan for tomorrow was disrupted because i got a phone call from one of those schools i've applied to, and i have an interview tomorrow at 1pm. gah. 

i need to free my wednesday then for makati. have lots to do in makati.

anyway, back to my four words. the four words i'm going to concentrate on today. oscars, (i just saw keanu earlier! and jake! i wonder if i missed matt damon and johnny depp or they are not going?) i want jake to win. i'm hoping jake will win. for lost, that'll be later at ten pm. my sis and i have been waiting forever for the season 2 premiere, finally tonight we'll be watching it.

portfolio, i hope to finish all the written part after oscars. (assuming i wouldn't fall asleep this afternoon) and lastly, applying for corporate jobs online. 

i just want to have a job. no more bumming around for me. (and from my previous experience - when i was a newly grad - this will be filled with disappointments)

but every cell of my being is wishing, wishing, wishing...praying.
