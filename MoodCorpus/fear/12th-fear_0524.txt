State of the pain
Well, I've learned some things.  I could go to Germany under the care of a medical doctor who's at a med school in PA, and get into a Ketamine coma for 5 days, and maybe I'll wake up pain free.  Yeah, baby, Special K all the way.
 
Turns out, they've found the first physical cause to the CRPS-I that I have, aka RSD.  There is small fiber nerve degeneration amongst people with CRPS-I.  Took them long enough, this was first noted in the 19th century.
 
I had it good, pain free from the last nerve block a month ago until a week and a half ago.  Now, the pain is pushing through.  It's equal on both arms and the back of my hands and my shoulder blade area.  However, my shoulder joints have stopped hurting so bad with movement, though I'm still going to the orthopedic.  The pain isn't constant, so my brain has a break from it, which means that emotionally I'm feeling much better, despite the burning being much harsher.  It's far, far easier to withstand bunches of pain, I've found, than constant pain.
 
So, I'm seeing my pain specialist today and we'll see what he says.  When the pain hits, it's quite often a 10 on the pain scale, with a 10 being the worst it can be.  It tends to wash over very quickly, except for last night, when it lasted from about 6 pm to 1 am. Oh, and very quickly is a couple of hours for me.
