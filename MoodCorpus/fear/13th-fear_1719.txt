Appointment T minus 2
Another pretty quiet day; which is a good thing as I had a predictably sleepless night having slept too long yesterday afternoon.

Me and mum got together to try some new cooking receipes as some mutual occupational therapy; which was great because I hadn't had the motivation to start myself, but enjoyed it once we were going.

The two receipes were a lime and pine-nut bread for lunch (which is pretty much a cake, and deliciously tart and zesty) and chicken laquered in five spices and star anise which is roasting for tonight. Hopefully it will end up as tasty as it smells.

Mostly of course I'm still waiting. Waiting for the GP's tomorrow to discuss a worrying development of the Diclofenac I'm taking for the kidney pain ('cause not being able to take that is going to be a bit of a bitch in the near future) and then Tuesday for the hospital appointment itself.

As I've said before, some of the treatment possibilities sound less then fun; but my deepest fear is that they will want to delay more before trying anything. I want to get better; I don't want to have to keep on living in the shadow of this fear. I'll endure any test, face any treatment, if I can only know I'm making some progress.

I don't know whether that makes me brave; or just more scared of what I'm already going through.
