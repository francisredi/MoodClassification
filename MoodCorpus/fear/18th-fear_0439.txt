Stressed out
I am on the edge . I dont know what to do or how much more I can take.If I did not have enough stress in my life the incident Friday night has really pushed close to the edge.I was already was unhappy at my job,dealing with the changing of locations, learning new tasks little to no training,Getting Robbed was not what I needed.On Top of One employee quitting at the end of the week another going in for out patient cancer surgery...
Now , I am considering looking for a new job, but it is always so hard for me to find a job.I dont know what to do and I am lost.
I am also concerned about the new shows added to the schedual,I am not sure I can make it to the theater on time especially if the movie is starting at 11 pm on friday,I was only expecting it to be the 2 weekends listed now its every other week. Saturday as it stands NOW wont be a problem, Friday will be a close call if i can make it at all.
Leanna and her problems with her muscles is worrying me also,I massage her constantly,I try to take care of her.
I am at my witts end I cant take anymore.I have felt sick ever since friday my stomach is upset,My hands start trembling .No matter what I do I will hurt or disappoint someone if not myself others who I care about.
I AM LOST
