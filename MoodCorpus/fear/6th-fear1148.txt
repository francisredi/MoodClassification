TT^TT   *sniffle*
what is up with people these days? I wake up a few minutes ago and since i couldn't get back to sleep, i thought i'd kill time checking my e-mails. i decide to listen to some mp3 music i got from nintendo's site, and then some idiot chucks what i thought was a brick at our front room window, the room i happened to be in!
i did see someone walking off aswell. i went to get my dad and he went outside with the torch, and i followed with my katana sword (it may be a replica but it's still deadly). It turns out it was just an egg, but we were the only house that got it. so not only am i really shaken up, i'm also angry and paranoid aswell. i mean, i don't remember pissing anyone off lately, i don't exactly go anywhere to piss anyone off. dad thinks it might've been because with live in the middle house of a row of 3, or that it's because our house was the only one with lights on at the time. other than me, why would people be out at 3-4am in the morning? other than to go to work. but people don't exactly egg houses on the way to work either do they?

i'm still shaken up. i burst into tears and was blubbering, not to mention shit scared. i've decided to keep my katana on my lap incase they come back. i honestly thought that someone was going to break in and hurt me or something. and i can't shake this feeling that someone or something is still watching me, and that it might happen again. i'm just peeved that my dad isn't going to report it to the police. i told him that if anything like that happens a 2nd time between now and next week, i'm going to call the police, even if i'm in tears at the time. i'd daren't even put my headphones on incase i don't hear them coming. I'm also scared to go back to bed now incase someone tries to break in, but i'm also scared to stay downstairs too.
what should i do? TT^TT *sniff*
