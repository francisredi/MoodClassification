Post from the other diary (To The Wanderer)
Hello sir,
I don't even really remember what I said, but you told me to put it down for the record so here we go...
I need your help. I need you to teach me. I need you to help me open up all the places that I've been being protected from. I need my music back, I need my words back. I need that passion, that fire, that is you.
If it's possible, please be gentle. I am not stupid, and I am not weak. But I am afraid.
Afraid of you, and all you represent. All you are, all you could give.
All I have is honesty, and a stubborn will.
Please don't manipulate me. I've told you off before, and I will again, but I seriously think that's a waste of time. And there has been enough time wasted already.
I am a child, far longer then I maybe should've been. Untrained.
But I am trainable. And if given an honest chance, I will make you proud.
Thank you sir. I drink to you.
