Dear Boy,

How am I supposed to tell you what you do to me when I can't even put it into words. The only way to say it is to say you take my breath away every time I see you. My heart races every time you smile, and when you talk everything else seems to fade away. I don't know why I keep feelings to myself, and for so long. Two and a half years is a long time to be head over heals for someone and not say anything, but I'm afraid of scaring you away. I don't see why you would want me when you could do so much better. We don't talk much - mostly because I'm almost too shy to talk to you - but I'm afraid of losing that friendship that we have. I just want to be the one you dream about. I want to be the one that makes you laugh and smile. I want to make you happier than you ever though you could be, because that's what you deserve. I can't understand why girls in the past treated you like they did. I guess they just couldn't see what I see. I've seen the way you look at your girlfriends and I've seen the way you treat them. How anyone could ever leave you is beyond me. It's hard to find someone that's never broken a heart, or at least not on purpose. I never thought I would find someone like that, let alone someone that's such an amazing person in so many different ways. I guess I just wish I could get over worrying about what you would say if I told you, or what you would do. I wish my voice didn't get stuck in my throat every time I talk to you. I just need some way to break the ice.

Sincerely,
Jes
