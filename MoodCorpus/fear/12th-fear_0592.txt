if you cant hear me screaming from there you arent listening hard enough
i lost my draftings.

you know, the ones i have been working on for a month.  they are gone.  i lost them somewhere in between my house and school.  they were strapped into the side pouch of my backpack, and i was so busy navigating through crowds with a huge model, that i didnt notice when they fell out.  it is brutally windy here today and i was trying so hard not to have my model fly away ...

ive retraced my steps, ive asked everyone at both mtero stops, i even looked in every trash can from school to my apartment.

ugh, i am so beyond upset righ tnow i cant even tell you.   im going to have to re-draft everything from memory, in like a week.  they were due today, so i am sure that on top of me feeling like SHIT about it, i am also going to go down a letter grade or two.

ive contacted my professor, but still.

ugh ugh ugh ugh UGH.

i hate fucking washington dc.
