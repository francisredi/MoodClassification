I am just so filled with fear
I can't believe it! Five fucking days I trained at this place and then they tell that they don't have any shifts for me!  My friend John is so judemental.  I think our friendship is going to change.  I am starting to see someone that I really like.  I don't have a job and don't have rent.  I am so filled with fear that I can't deal with it!  
  I am so scared and continue to believe in a higher power that I am starting to have doubts about.  I hate it when I start doubting God, I get scared, like I am going to go backwards into the pits of despair.
But I am so scared!  I want everything to be ok now! I can't sleep because I keep thinking about the boy.
  I am afraid that I might hurt him or vice versa.  I use to date him when I was sixteen and all tweaked out on glass.  I'm scared that this might be fantasy and not real.  Maybe we are infatuated with each other because we were each others first.  I'm scared!  
  I push people away because of self-hatred and fear and I know if I have faith everything will be ok but how do you have faith when everything is wrong?  I hope people read this and give me some feedback and let me know that I am not alone.
