why can i not become what i want to become... why can i not do something that makes me happy, day after day...ive turned into those stupid kids that i made fun of, the ones that just mope around all day and dont talk to anyone. i think that i am scared. i am scared to become a failure, scared that if i actually have a goal and work as hard as i can to achieve it, that it wont come true. i think its really funny, in a fuckin ironic bullshit since, that everytime i tell someone that im in a band, and i like what we r doing, everything just falls apart. it sux so bad that we cant even stay together to play one fuckin show. its a nice day outside, at least im not freezing my ass off like usual. we have band practice tonight, just me kyle and blake, so we will probably just jam around, which i hope will be fun, cuz we havent done that for like 3 weeks. im out of money again. still dont have a job... due to the lack of a social securitry card.  i dont really want to work at mcd's either but it pays 5.50 then 6 after 2 weeks, so hopefully after a month something better will come up. ever since mid december my life has just been shit... cant stay happy for more than a day, usually not even that long, im not saying my life is bad, just sayin im not enjoyin it. the most fuckin ignorant things piss me off, i hate that about myself, i hate that everytime something doesnt go my way i hurt someone else. i fuckin hate my roommate with a passion and hope i never see him again after this school year. he just bothers the fuck out of me. we sit in the same fucking room and say nothing to eachother, while he watches divorce court or something queer like that, god i hope i find a house to live in this summer, maybe my life will follow the same pattern, and with every break from school something dramatic happens... hopefully
