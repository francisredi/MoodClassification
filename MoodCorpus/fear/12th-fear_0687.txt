Just about everything you're told to avoid during a hurricane, my neighbors and I went ahead and did yesterday. As crazy of a choice it was, what with power lines taking fall as well as trees, we drove to the nearby pier and stood on it with a couple of other guys interested in the storm like us. The winds were between 55 and 60mph and the rain felt like needles on the sides of our faces as we dared to look at the mess in the sky. Most people find the sight of a hurricane so depressing, but I think the water looks more beautiful than it does on a calm day. Especially when the winds pick up. Following all of that, we headed back to the house where we went swimming. Only for a bit though. 
Power outage from nine o' clock to four. Which is the time I woke up today. My parents were in long, loud debate over opening the restaurant or not. The final result? Opening. My brother came home early telling me that an electrical wire almost set fire to the restaurant causing evacuation in the middle of everyone's breakfast. My father and I have driven around the area looking at what destruction Frances has caused. American flags dirtied and laying out on the lawns, leaves everywhere, branches and trees. It's all there. Yes, my father was supposed to leave this morning, but because of Frances he's been re-scheduled to leave Sunday. As devastating as people find the destruction caused by the hurricane, I find my father's delay much more.
