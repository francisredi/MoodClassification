i wish i knew, but i dont. panic panic panic

i made easter cards--LOTS of them. i lost a lot of my addresses, so make sure to send me yours if you want one. 

my cold hands are interfering with my violin. that is NOT cool (no pun intended)

do mean girls end up with the nice guys? do they become nice girls? or do  the nice guys just put up with it their whole lives?

i hope the "mean girl" thing is like the "bad-boy" phase girls go through (at least I went through it!). . .
i'll never go back to that phase. as much as i used to hope to, i couldnt change a person. let's see: spend my life with the challenge of being appreciated or grow with someone who treats me like a person should be? Gosh, that's a hard one ;)

My little sister (Kahlie) is coming home Tuesday. She's really one of my best friends; like i've said, i'm craving an intimate relationship. Those 5 days she's home will be pure bliss for me :) Bonus: she gets to be here for my local pageant *sweet!*

friends come and go, but family remains. if you havent met my family, well, you should come over for dinner. 

i have so much on my mind and so much to say. . .funny how that works.
