long time no update
So i have this geography test to take at 7 30 AM (less than 6 horus away) so i've been studying all day. Reason I'm taking it at 7 30 as opposed to 4 30 PM is I'm filling in for someone that dropped out of the Rosen college belly dance gig. I was informed of this last friday and didn't learn my solo til monday, i've got it pretty much down. I got my costume altered and a skirt made, the bra and belt used to be patricia's, hopefully it'll look ok on me, I'm kinda nervous, i've never done a solo before, nor have i been belly dancing for any amount of time to be considered good, but hey, i just gota deal with it. Plus i have to dance with a veil which i've NEVER done before, AND zills, which i've only played with. What fun! So tommorow i gota take my test then i guess hit up the flea market for some costume jewerly and then walmart for some more make up, i guess eye shadow and lipstick? hell if i know what to buy i barely wear make up as it is.  oh the nervousness

i dont plan on sleeping tonight but i'll proabably take a little nap until 4 or so. then wake up again and more study til 5 30 when brock calls and talk to him til he leaves for school.

i went to starbucks today and loaded up on caffine then came back home, picked up shellie and went out to the gas station for more (cheaper) caffine. My stomach seems to be disagreeing with it right now, it'll deal, no tummie, no food for you til after the show. ok maybe a celery stick and an orange but that's it!!

welp back to the studying
