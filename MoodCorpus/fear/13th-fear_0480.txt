Losing my Wisdom
yeah, this is probably going to make a lot of people laugh, but I am really scared because I am going to have my wisdom teeth taken out this Friday!!  I put it off as long as I could.  Jeremy is poo-pooing my fears because he had a really easy time, but I am scared to death still.  My mother is no help because she keeps telling me all these horror stories and I want to throw up every time she talks about blood-soaked gauze.  Sounds silly I know, but I would rather have two eye surgeries or deliver a baby again, then have this small procedure done. I am scared to death.  It is silly because I have gone through so many operations...I don't know why this scares me so much.  I am more nervous about this then I am about the transplant surgery!!

On an unrelated topic I am really pissed off at a person I used to be close friends with, even used to date at one point in time.  During my vision loss Jeremy told me that I should get some books on tape, and I agreed.  I had a heck of a time though finding the info and there were a lot of places who did it, and I wanted one that I knew would be good.  This person and I haven't talked in six months but I figured that he of all people would understand an eye thing and would kindly give over the info.  No such luck I guess.  I emailed his wife because I could not find his email address.  She was polite enough to email me back and let me know that she had forwarded on the request and that she was sorry to hear about the vision loss.  At least someone has manners in that marriage!!  I knew she was a great person.  Anyway, it pisses me off because he is probably so full of himself that he thinks I was using that as an excuse to talk to him again or something.  Uh, no...just wanted the info.  That would be a pretty F.U. excuse.  What a jerk...
