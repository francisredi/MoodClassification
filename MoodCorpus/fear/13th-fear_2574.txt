Harder to breathe
So John told me last night that I should take a day to myself. I need to just pamper myself and not regret it. 

I decided he was right. I really do need a mental health day, so to speak. 

Sometime next week, I am going to turn off my phone, ignore my computer, and just relax. I never relax. I never have time to myself. I'm constantly going to work, going to school, doing schoolwork, hanging out with Kevin, hanging out with my friends, helping my friends with their problems, helping Kevin with his problems, and speculating about my problems but never getting an opportunity to solve them because I am always full speed ahead. 

Maybe if I just relax, I'll get some clarity. Maybe if I just act selfish for one day I can have a much more positive outlook on the way my life is going right now. That sounds silly, but honestly I don't really focus on my problems that much. I am constantly trying to help other people out. Which is great, don't get me wrong, but I am always scared to talk to other people about my problems because I'm afraid that they won't care. Which is stupid, but that's just what I do.

So hopefully this idea will work out. 

Hopefully. Because it's getting harder and harder to develop good coping mechanisms. ::sighs::
