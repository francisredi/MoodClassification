Dreams and Dreamy men
The actor who plays Sawyer on LOST was named 'TVs hottest hunk.'  I'm sure that's no surprise to Katy.  http://www.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/TV/01/26/tvhunks.ap/index.html

I came across the description to a very disturbing fic last night.  It was a BUFFY/Chronicles of Riddick crossover, with Riddick/Xander slash.  I simply gaped in horror.  The mind boggles.  

I think that episode caused my disturbing Buffy dream last night.  Faith came back and put a spell on Angel, forcing him to marry her just to piss Buffy off.  Faith was wearing a dress made out of cobwebs.  Buffy tried to stop them, but Faith's (nonexistent) father showed up and held her off.  Then there was a wedding feast and everyone ate fried chicken, which turned out to be fried demons.  Buffy was trying to save Angel, but he was being a bit poncy/peace-loving and not cooperating.  His face was also distorting for some reason under the onus of the spell.  It was creepy.  I finally woke up to my alarm, and decided for the first time in weeks not to hit the snooze button.


Even though I've been told by that Prof. that I'm invited to Indiana, I haven't recieved the actual invitation yet.  It is making me antsy.
