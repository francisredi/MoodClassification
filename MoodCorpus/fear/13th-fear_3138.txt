UTI from hell, urologist
I have the UTI from hell. I have had it for over 3 weeks. I have been on 2 rounds of antibiotics. It will not go away. My internist said that it was the worst UTI that he has ever seen (from the concentration in the urine analysis). I seem to get UTIs at least every 3 months. He has no idea as to why I am getting them. I have had numerous urine cultures, U/As, etc. He is referring me to a urologist. We have a great urology group that has 25-30 docs in it. I am nervous. I will find out on Monday what the name of the doc is. I also want to know if I have to go now or if I can wait until I have the next UTI to go. My internist said that he is very interested in what this doctor has to say so I am guessing that I will have to go now. I seriously can't go until I lose weight b/c they are never going to believe that I am "anorexic". They will never believe my past history. Ahhhh!! I am going to call the place and ask what they do on the first visit. They are NOT sticking anything in me (trauma stuff). I don't know if they will want to culture the urinary tract or ureters or bladder, etc. They can't do that - too much trauma stuff - I will dissociate. I am panicking. Has anyone ever been to a urologist? What happens? I have to lose weight - fast. I just have to figure out how to do it with Jim watching so damn closely. The Depo also won't allow me to lose weight as easily as I could if I didn't have it in my system (that's coming from the doc). Thank goodness it will be out of my system in 6 weeks - but that is a long freakin' time!!! I will NEVER take another shot again! Sorry for all of the rambling. So many things are going on right now. I need to journal more, but am too depressed to do it. Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Take care! Angie
