Anxiety Sucks.
I have my hardest test in t minus 47 minutes.  I don't think I have been so scared of a test before in my life.  I recieved my iPod on Monday.  It fills me with relaxing music to keep my heart rate down to a livable beat.  My hands are shaking as I write this.
I can dominate a Cournot and Stackelberg equilibrium.
I'm getting better with mixed strategies and subgame perfect equilibrium.
Ooh, and I'm good at figuring out strictly and weakly dominant/dominated actions.
I will suffer from vNM preferences and applying their probabilities.
I cannot speak in symbolic logic.
Oh Game Theory, how did you get so hard!?

It's chilly here in Pittsburgh.  We got lotsa snow last night.
I was at the library until 1 or so.  While waiting for the bus, we noticed that one on the bus path had gotten into an accident, so no other busses were able to pass.  Chris and I walked home in the snow.  We got home at 1:57.  I lost the bet.  By the time we were in front of our apartment building, a bus drove past.  Was it better to wait for 20 minutes or so and take the bus or walk home for 20 minutes or so?

I don't feel so hot.  I'm gonna learn me vNM preferences.  I'm cold.
