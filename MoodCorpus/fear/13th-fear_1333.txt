I have decided that I dont want to grow up, Im pretty good just being 15. I dont want to have to move out, go to college, get a job, and pay my own way through things. Im pretty good with my mommy and daddy paying for stuff. I figured out the other night that Im fucking scared of going to college. I dont want to go, Im scared. I just want to stay in high school with all my friends and not go anywhere. I dont want to have to get a job, I dont want to have pay bills and I dont want to have to move out and be on my own. I mean, moving out would mean alot of good things too. Doing whatever the hell I want, when I want, with whom ever I want. But then, there's cons too. Paying for everything, cleaning everything, worrying about everything. College is less than a year and a half a way. And essentially, Im still the little girl that I was way back in elementary school.

Everything in my conversations with my parents revolves around college and how hard it is to get in now a days. What I need to do to get in to my top pick college is pretty much all I think now. I try to push in the back of my mind. Everyday Im surrounded by it. At school and at home. It seems like everybody is living in the future when we should be living in the moment. Sure, I want to go to college, but not now and not in a year and a half.
