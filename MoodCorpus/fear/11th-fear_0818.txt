The moment of truth
Well the time has finnaly come. I fear this day and what it will bring i know this cause i have that empty feeling i get when something is going to happen. Its wierd but my body can somehow tell if something is going to happen to me! i have no intentions of leaving anything out in the open i plan to kill every doubt every fear every little pest of a emotion that hinders me and laura from getting along like we should. I'm just afriad i might say something wrong and hurt her feelings,yet if i do i hope its for the best,but i have no intentions of placing her in any pain i just want to relieve it from her and from me. this visit is a time for make up not make out! LOL! ;)!  I hope every thing gets settled and is  tossed into the black abyss never to be seen again. OH Ash this just crossed my mind. In english we have been talking about courtly love well i thought about it and came to the conclusion that you and me are kinda like that! just were short some of the things that make it up but over all we are kinda in that position! LOL! haha! i love you ash! lol! well i need to prepare myself for tonight so later guys!
