Hospital
I'll make this short because i've only just got back from my Mum's and i'm due to go back to the doctors in half an hour.4am this morning I was woken up with pains like I was in labour. Knowing that I am not pregnant I tried going to the toilet, walking around etc to get rid of the pain before my girlfriend decided we better take me to the hospital.6-30am - I'd seen the doctor and he wasn't sure what it was. He was sure it WASN'T appendicitis or a gall attack (I had mine removed in 2000) and he was pretty sure it wasn't a kidney stone because although there was a small amount of blood in my urine it wasn't enough to suggest that. He dosed me up with Morpheine and Maxalon (to stop me feeling like I wanted to hurl) and then told me to go home. I went to my Mum's because my girlfriend had to work and I wasn't supposed to be left alone.So it's now 4.30pm and the Morpheine has well and truly worn off. I wasn't going to see the doc again today but the pain is getting worse and luckily for me he had a cancellation or I would have had to see the emergency doctor who didn't see me this morning.So I might be quiet for 24/48 hours while they try and get rid of this pain for me.
