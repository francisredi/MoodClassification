I have a dream...that scared me shitless
Okay, maybe the Bill Nye thing got to my head. Or maybe it was all Johnny's fault. But last night I had a dream that I NEVER want to have EVER again and it made me realize how hard it's gonna be to grow and everyone around you dies.
    It started out like A LOT of my disturbing dreams. I wake up in bed and my T.V.'s on and turned to the news. The news is reporting that Dev (yes, Dev!!!) has died. I felt a really cold emptiness in my heart and I felt like I was going to die (of sadness and grief). I remember telling you, (you being Erika), and you kinda said, "Oh no." It reminded me of the time when I woke up and Dad was watching my T.V. in my room and getting the news that George Harrison had died (so yes, you were concerned).
    I remember when I was at school I kept it to myself and when it was lunch time (which was fairly quick [you know how dreams are just flashes off scenes{much like a movie}]) I was standing outside of these big orange steps and I saw myself crying and falling on to those steps, burying my head in my hands.
    Now I am even more terrified of death than ever. Not as much as Mikey, maybe, but a lot. And now for the conclusion of my REAL day, today:
    SOME BITCH STOLE MY PENCIL POUCH! So now I have lost: three Demarco dollars(which are extra credit pints to add to tests), my ID card, my calculator, 3 of Dad's EXPO pens(plz don't tell him!), Tati's "Jesus Loves You" book that she gave me, and all of my school supplies.
    WHAT SON OF A BITCH WOULD DO THAT?!
    Well I suppose I kind of deserve it since yesterday I left Alyssa's 40 dollar jacket ont he floor and someone stole it and she's gonna get grounded, BUT STILL!
    I am so pissed you don't even know! jkhfjkfkjnsdjkgnsdjkg.
