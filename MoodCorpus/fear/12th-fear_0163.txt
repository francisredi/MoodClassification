ashy  wednesday
My mom dragged me to church with her tonight (she wants me to go to all of the lent services with her) so i dragged squeaky with me. We pretty much just laughed the whole time. Then we had this brilliant idea that we should go see if the hole in the cemetary fence is still there before we go with the guys later. We entered the dark obiss by the light of our cell phones, crawled through the thorny branches in the woods, fell in the mudd and got a little lost. We did however find our hole. Like 3 seconds after getting into the cemetary she let out this horrible scream & said that she heard something russle. Then i was all creeped out, so we decided to sit down on this grave and call some people. We were both paranoid & no one would come meet us there, so we wandered around & got ourselves lost. Then we were talking to her bf and we both heard the russling, it kept getting closer, we both screamed and ran... we ran the whole f*cking way home.
