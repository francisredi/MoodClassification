Nightmare
I was tired today because I was up way too late (as usual), but also because when I DID sleep I had a horrible nightmare that wouldn't go away.

In it, my parents both died but didn't know that they were dead. My dad went about his business getting ready to go to work and such (even though he was a ghost and no one but me saw him), and my mom went about doing what she always does in the morning to get him ready and take care of the house. I knew they were dead but they didn't...and my mom's ghost talked to me. I don't know where my sister was, but Ian was nowhere to be found at all and I was all alone. It was especially painful because it was sudden, not from illness or anything, just a car wreck or some other accident and they were gone and they weren't aware. 

I was troubled for most of the day. I told Erica about it and she said that she'd had a dream EXACTLY like it, but that was several years ago. She seemed creeped out that I had the same dream now.
