i had this really fucking scary dream last night.

i was in vietnam helping out kids during the war by handing out food, and then vietcong snipers came into my town, and started shooting peoplem, and my mom and i went to this house in a "safe zone" and we were told to watch this video. the video was a vietcong terrorist video of snipers killing civilians, and it was up close of their face as they get shot. and the one guy in the movie turned fast and he was still blinking as he got machine gunned in the face..and the movie showed a few more people and then this woman smiling and laughing, and a truck pulled up and gunned her in the eyes...and i told my mom i coudn't watch it anymore and she forced me to watch more of killing little kids..and i ran outside the safe zone and out next to a railing overlooking a river, and i jumped over it and i saw a whirlpool spinning and i freaked out and as i fell in the water i moved my body over to hold onto the railing beams

then i woke up.

and right now my whole jaw & cheeks hurt, and i have this cramp in my wrists.
i can't sleep anymore.

i have work in a few hours.
