Ignored
I hate being ignored. I don't want the past to be repeated, yet it is my biggest fear. I hate that I grow attached to people and then get hurt when they get taken away from me. I feel like for some reeason no matter how much I love my friends, something takes them away from me, whether it is a gf/bf or a move or drama or just so many thing interfere with my happiness. And what makes me happiest in the world is my friends. And I feel stupid crying over this, something so stupid as having a guy who happens to be one of your very good friends ignore you, especially when so many other people have worse things going on. But I guess why it hurts so much is because I have been hurt like this before and my greatest fear is losing this friend. I sometimes doubt how much he cares about me. I guess I am just being jealous but he like many of my other friends means a great deal to me and I don't want to lose him. This semester alone many of my friendships have weakened. I can't stand to lose another friend, especially one that I have grown close to and I guess has made a BIG difference or has had a BIG impact on my life. Maybe I'm scared for nothing. Hopefully things will only change for the better.
