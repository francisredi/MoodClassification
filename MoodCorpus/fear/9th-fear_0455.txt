Things Fall Apart...
Hey you guys I'm scared. I'm soo scared that i might be breaking up again with the guy i love. I don't want this to happen. I REALLY don't want this to happen, but it just might and happen soon. You see Larry nor i have a car, so it is very hard for us to see each other making the time we spend together little and far between. I hate it, he hates it and it is the space is hurting us both like hell. I just don't know what to do. I don't want to ever let him go but if this thing is killing us to hang on, what else do i do? I hope i am able to keep hope alive, keep fighting and knowing that this is meant to be and that i will faithfully be by his side. I pray that this trial will be over soon and that our relationship will grow stronger than ever, but what if it won't. Don't get me wrong i'm not saying that our relationship is just gonna be thrown out the window because i'm telling you that my love for him never will. He is my Knight in shining armor that scooped me up and out of a painful situation and told me everything would be alright. He saved me and it is because of him that i am the strong woman i am now. Every brokenhearted woman needs a Larry. No one can replace him, so why do i feel i might have to try? Not again. I refuse to cry for a lost love. I'm tired of playing this foolish game. Again i say that if it doesn't work out with Larry, I'm will not continue to search for love in this world. I'm am gonna be one cold hearted bitch.
