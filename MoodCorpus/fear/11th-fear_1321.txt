so i was just thinking about my future, as young people do, and several things came to mind. so i've been thinking of what i'd like to do when i grow up for a while now. psychologist, film director, cartoonist, web designer, english teacher, writer, some kind of linguist, zoologist, chemist, science teacher, kindergarden teacher, something to do with music, or a person that mysteriously recieves boatloads of money one day and becomes an eccentric billionaire who travels the world and buys ridiculous things like a life size replica of a t-rex and a robot or something like that. i've narrowed it down to psychology and english though. i'm pretty sure those are the two things i'm pretty much totally interested in. i'm just scared that english and psychology are only things i like to do, and i'll never be any good at transforming them into any sort of career. frikkityfrak i love both. i think i'm going to explore my options with psych more, it's quite a broad subject. i just need to figure out if i can do more than just learn it. i love learning psych. but i can i do? balahalajldsjjdvsj i'm weird.

omg lisa's bday is coming up!!!! i need to buy her a giiifffft!

i wonder if i'll have anything to do after work...

i hope steve isn't mad at me. >.< you know everytime i get mad at someone i always worry if they're mad at me back. and i'm not even mad. i get like mad and upset for like seconds at a time. you could kill my dog and as long as you gave me a hug and an apology afterwards i'd be fine with it. honestly, i'm sick.

i'm at work, alone, afraid the southern guy'll come back and the people upstairs are making loud noises =( but the tattoo guys promised theyd protect me!!!!
