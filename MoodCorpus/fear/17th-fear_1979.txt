good luck? bad luck? i guess we'll see....
tommorrow I have an interview in Newburgh (not that far off from where i live) and in Poughkeepsie (farther off)...did a test drive to find said places and found that Poughkeepsie is mighty mighty confusing and not a place i'd want to get lost in, being as inexperienced at driving as i am (pete also says that he'd get lost there himself) so, i' think i'll call there and either cancel the appointment or see if i can get it moved to a day where i can get pete to go with me (it's for Walgreen's so id u nno if it's even worth my time anyways). The one in Newburgh is a little "easier" to get to from my place, muchly straightforward and we only got a little lost finding the place (it was on an offroad from the main one and we didn't see any street sign for it...must be missing...)&nbsp; So, I will drive to Newburgh tommorrow for an interview and i don't know which part makes me more nervous...the interview or getting there (other drivers can be so unforgiving on big roads and i'm worried i'll actually get into a 'turning only' lane and screw up somehow)....I wanted to call some ppl and say hi tonight, but I think after the harrowing experience of me driving all over the area for the test drive...i just need some time to relax.....oi
