The calm before the storm
It has been decided that we are going to kick Jenn out. Plain and simple, we just can't stand her anymore, and we won't. She has begun to jeopardize things around this house; her relationship with Sean, and even the relationship I have with Craig. When he can't come home from work anymore and not have me in a bad mood, I know it's time to do something about this. 

However, Jenn, when she has been up and about, it has not been when Craig is around. However, if she thinks that hiding in Sean's room is going to protect her from getting kicked out, then she's dead wrong. Eventually she will have to see us, and it's not going to be pretty then. I'm so frustrated with what she's been doing, that I am past the point of caring how it affects Sean. He still doesn't have a job, so I'm doubtful that he'll be here far into the next month. We refuse to put him up like we did Brendon, and if it means we have to pawn him off onto another friend, we'll do it. We simply can't afford it anymore.


Went to St. Bunstable's today, in North Seattle. Samuel came out for the rapier tournament, and took it. It was a fun event, very small, about 15 people, lol. But it was nice, it was personable, and it was a change from the big events. I've been used to those recently, and it was a nice break. 

However, as nice as today was, Jenn will be getting off work soon, and that means that Craig may very well let loose on her...

Like I said, it's the calm before the storm...I can only imagine what the storm will be like.
