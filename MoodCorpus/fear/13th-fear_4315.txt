getting cold feet...
Well, I discussed with my Grad school advisor the path I am going to choose for research today.  I also got the low down on my acceptance.  To be honest, my GPA is not the hottest courtesy of my time spent in Anthropology land.  So, I must have a 3.0 by the end of the first year.  I guess that is not unreasonable and I can do it.  I guess I am just a little nervous and I really should not psyche myself out so soon.  It is just that there was one prof who was against me.  It is like he doesn't think anyone can do anything.  I just want to prove him wrong so badly.  At the same time, I am nervous and wonder if I can do it.  I have such poor faith in myself and I know that I am capable of doing it but yet I don't.  I am afraid of success and part of that stems from my interactions with my family.  If I am successful then I feel as if they will resent me.  Some of them already do because of the path I have taken.  Some of the people at home that I use to associate with act the same way.  I should not care but I do because part of me feels guilty about their resentment.  I feel as if I am doing something wrong.  The only problem is, I am conflicted with feeling ecstatic about studying geology and earning the title of "doctor" someday...

Sometimes success is complex when it should not be...
