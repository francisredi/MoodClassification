UUUUAAAAAHHHH!
Oh my God, I am scared shit less! Will start my internship in 9.5 hours and I feel sick. I hate coming into a new environment, not knowing anybody, not knowing what I'll have to do, what they expect from me... Looking up the curriculum vitae of my professor didn't help, he is totally into acute phase proteins. If he asks me a questions about those I am dead.
No, relax. When did I ever start something new and didn't manage to feel quite comfortable within a week or two? Never, of course. 
I guess, I am just not the most adventures guy. New challenges make me nervous, they don't give me an extra kick or something. Then why didn't I study something I knew I could do??? No, I had to try medicine and in less than ten hours I will have to pretend that I know what I am doing. 
Well, I can't run, can I? So, take deep breath, smile and hope for the best. But i guess I'll light a candle at my family's grave nonetheless. I've found that the stubbornness that is a distinct characteristic in all our family members is something like an extra-drive. That and the pride. Sometimes I think only these two things kept me going in medicine for so long now.

More happy news: Have managed to go to the gym twice a week and I am enjoying it. And I got an SMS from Hans (he owns a pub in Schwandorf) and he sort of asked me out.
