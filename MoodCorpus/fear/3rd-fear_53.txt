Trying not to panic
About 2 or 3 times an hour I get lots of pain, but not really like the contractions I remember.  My whole torso just hurts and I have to stop and breathe a bit.  I was thinking maybe I'm constipated since I haven't gone in like 4 days, but then I haven't consumed a normal meal in 4 days.  I've been peeing a little bit when I have to go and it's been very dark.

I KNOW I'm dehydrated, I haven't been able to drink water in days and I really trying to today.  Each time I've peed it's been very dark and it just catches me each time because I haven't seen anything red tinted down there in a long time.  Well, I just went and my pantyliner was tinted (I'm wearing one today for fear that I might leak a little if I need to puke or anything) and I was unable to tell if I'm spotting or just have deep deep orange pee.  Before I was fairly certain, and this time I'm not.  :(  I'm going to really push the water for the next 2 hours and if it doesn't change I'm going to the hospital.  When I called my nurse yesterday she said that if I don't start feeling better and stop puking soon I will have to go get an IV for fluids, and I'm really thinking I need that.  And you all know I'm scared shitless of needles and IVs.  I've been dizzy and lethargic all day and now my throat is a little scratchy and my nose is slightly runny, but my nausea and all that is about 80% gone.  I'm at work today and I'm thinking maybe coming in was a mistake.  But this whole week has gone unpaid since I'm out of vacation time and I can't keep getting partial paychecks.  

Deep breath.  I'm going to be fine.  The last thing I need is a panic attack.  :(  

Oh and Brayden is starting to catch a cold.  Fuck.
