Theres a very unsettling vibe in the house.

I havent been feeling very well the past couple of days(in a mental sort of way), and it felt different from my normal anxieties, so not only was it sad but unfamiliar too. I tried to medicate it with a good game(Wind Waker) which has been working pretty well for the most part.


But now its a more obvious reason. Everyone seems to be getting sick, starting with Willy. The day before yesterday he started throwing up and having bad pains in his lower stomache area. Mom was afraid it might be appendicitus(sp?). Him and my mom are at the hospital now. But considering April is now sick its probably a virus. But I hope he is alright either way.

Im really afraid of getting sick. I mean I never like to get sick but just especially this sort of virus, I really really dont want to throw up. And of course Ive been feeling a little nautious, I dont know if its the fear or if Im getting it too or what.


So mom and Willy arent here, April is sick and throwing up too(sorry April :( ) and dad is already in bed, despite usually being downstairs playing bass or piano or something. I asked him "are you already going to bed?" and he said he just didnt want to get sick and he was feeling nautious too. :( scary stuff. 

I really really dont want to throw up.
If I thought I was feeling unsettled before I definatly am now.
