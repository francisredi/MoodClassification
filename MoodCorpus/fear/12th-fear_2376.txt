I need to go to the Student Health & Wellness Center today after class because for a couple days now I've been having a dull yet uncomfortable ache in the right side of my pelvic area. I'm trying to think when the last time I had my period was. I know I had one the week before Christmas, and I'm vaguely remembering that I had one the 3rd or 4th week of January. At any rate its been over a month, not that that means anything because I've never had a consistently regular cycle. However with my history of having twice had surgery to remove a cyst or tumor from my right ovary, I'm concerned. I think I might actually break down and cry if this ends up being the same thing. Not only am I just starting to get my life back on track as far as school goes, surgery sucks. Atleast a two week recovery period, probably longer because i'm horribly out of shape right now, then I cannot lift anything over 10 lbs. or do any kind of exercise besides light walking for 6-8 weeks afterwards. On top of just being extremely disruptive to my life, if this ends up being what is highly possible that it is, since this would be the third time some kind of mass has developed on my right ovary, it would be removed this time. 

Gahhh... please just let it be some kind of premenstrual cramp thing!!!
