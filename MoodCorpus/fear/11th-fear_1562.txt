Oh my god...
Ok so today hasn't been a good day cuz I was suppossed to go to Late Nite and eat Fazolis (FREE) and then tomorrow go to church but getting my car after the oil change was done didn't work out and so I'm stuck here. They don't open til 10 tomorrow and I have no way to get there, take care of it, pick up Aaron, and get to church. So my excitment that I'd had about going is dashed cuz I can't get there.

But, that's the least of my problems. I THOUGHT my date to appear in court was on Monday at 4:50. Because at the bottom of my ticket it says "I promise to appear as follows or be subject to arrest and/or license suspension." It says Feb. 27, 2006 at 4:50. K well I misplaced the letter that I was handed with it. Here's what IT says (I found it tonight): "The date at the bottom of your ticket under "Court Appearance" is an Arraignment Date only. IT IS NOT YOUR TRIAL DATE. If you wish to plead Not Guilty, you must contact the court to arrange a Trial date." Then it goes on to talk about if you want to pay the fine. Then next sentence REALLY worries me..."If your ticket is not paid within 30 days after issuance, or a court date arranged prior to that date, YOUR LICENSE WILL BE SUSPENDED, AND YOU WILL BE SUBJECT TO A 25.00 LATE FEE." 

The ticket itself was 127.00 and I can't admit guilty cuz that makes the insurance go up and I can't afford that! Hence the reason I asked for a 1/2 day of work on Monday so that I could go since it said court appearance. But now I'm thinking my license may seriously be suspended and the only way to fix it is to pay. I mean, does the sentece read separately that the court date must be arranged prior to the date (on my ticket)? Cuz if not, I've got serious issues and no one to bail me out. I really am going to vomit all over myself.

**If anyone has any idea about legal jargon, I NEED SERIOUS HELP! Please help!!!
