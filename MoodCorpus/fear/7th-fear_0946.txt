I have never been so scared!
I don't know where to begin, but I have just got to let all of this out.  I have never experienced anything like what I experienced tonight.  I was cooking supper and I finished and had to go get my daughter up from her nap, so I can put her in her high chair.  I had already told my husband like 3 times really politely that supper was ready.  So I walked over to the computer, where he was downloading music and told him to get off the computer and go help me fix his plate. He all of a sudden jumped up and got in my face yelling and spitting, so i spit back at him and he grabbed me up by my throat and was choking me and then he realized what he had done and tried to act
like he was playing.  He just like snapped.  It scared me so bad.  To make matters worse, I was talking on the phone with his mom the whole time.  It is scary to think what would have happend if I hadn't been.  I called my parents and asked them to come over, I really did not know what else to do.  So they did and they talked to us.  They wanted to take me back home for the night, but I decided not to go.  I guess I want to try and work out my problems.  I hope that I made the right decision.  Physically, I am ok.  Mentally... not so much.  It is not good when you are scared of your own husband.  He really has a problem... I hope he will get help soon.
