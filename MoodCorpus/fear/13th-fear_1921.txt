How the fuck...?
How the fuck do people afford to live on their own?
How can you afford rent, groceries, cable, phone, internet, car, and gas?
I'm sure I could sort of afford maybe half of this if I didnt have debt from university but MAN!
Everything is so goddamn expensive!

I'm a far cry away from attaining any of the above.

Its been close to a year since I graduated and I have accomplished the following things:
-I have begun my career as a dance instructor
-I have paid $370 off on my Royal Credit Line
-By friday I will have paid off all of my debt to Brock Dance
(Decreasing my total debt between loans, credit cards & Brock dance by a mere $1400)
-By tomorrow HOPEFULLY I will have obtained my g1 driver's license

In terms of finances I haven't paid off a whole lot.

I am officially stating my summer goal as being TO PAY OFF my $2500 CREDIT CARD DEBT.
With my credit card payments complete my only monthly fixed expenses would be my cellphone & loan payment

Seriously though....I am becoming really impatient and I need to make things happen faster.
