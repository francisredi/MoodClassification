in my hamster wheel 
Well, its really hard to get back into the whole "going to school" mode when you've had such a relaxing break. Opera is completely kicking my butt and I practiced over break, but you could never tell it from the way things actually go in opera. I feel overwhelmed and stressed already. Also, most of you already know I had to go back to Julia. I was really looking forward to breaking free from her and now I just feel stressed again. I really do want things to go better, but I don't know if they can. I think we both just clash because of our personalities. I'm really trying hard and I know I'll get through, I survived last semester. I should be relieved about opera because its a smaller role than last year, but I just feel pressure. On top of that, I just feel burnt out with school. I love seeing my friends and learning, but I'm tired of all the expectations and pressure...mostly coming from myself (if THAT makes any sense!) I'm really hoping and praying things are gonna get better because all this stuff isn't really important in the long run. I let myself get so wrapped up "in the now" that I forget that its fleeting and will soon be over. I fixate too much on situations and things I can't change...I need help or I'm going to drive myself CRAZY. I wish I didn't care so much...
