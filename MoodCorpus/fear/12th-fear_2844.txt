OK I didn't think I was afraid of spiders but apparently I have a case of arachnaphobia. I saw a tiny little ass spider on my wall and I screamed, left the room, and proceeded to freak out. I went back in my room, saw it again, screamed, threw a kleenex box at it, it fell off my wall and into the garbage but was still alive so I grabbed my aerosol hairspray and blasted it to its doom. Well, I hope it's dead. I haven't peered back in the garbage since then. AHHHHHHHHH I have to take the garbage out now...gross

I hope there aren't more of those fuckers. My God, they are terrifying. I don't know why they just are. I'm such a girl.

Oh yeah and I'm back in Ithaca. And still awake cuz it's only 1:30 in Cali. Don't matter cuz I got nuthin to do on Sunday and I'm planning on sleeping the day away. Fantastic.

I'm still shaking...lol this is ridiculous
