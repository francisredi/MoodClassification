This post is in response to what  wrote in reply to my last post.

I have a bad tendency to use hyperbole for humourous effect. It gets me into a lot of trouble, because people take me literally and then back off from the scary, crazy lady. (Ack, I did it there again! It's like my Tourette's Syndrome!)

That said, if I'm being completely honest and literal, I still find it really . . . exciting and amazing that I have friends who want to hang out with me and do things with me. For many years, I didn't have that. When people tried to befriend me, I'd panic and shoot them down, because I was so afraid of being hurt by them. However, I wasn't self-aware enough to realise what I was doing, and I assumed that they were rejecting me, because I wasn't worthy of being anyone's friend. It took a couple months of therapy (ack) to acknowledge my behaviour patterns. It's just recently that I've tried to have a social life again, and, much to my shock, it is actually working. O_o 

Yeah, I'm very lame. Now, I have shukokai class. Osu~ Tatakae~ ^_^
