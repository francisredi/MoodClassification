Bang bang you're dead
So that's twice in my life now I've phoned 911.

I was in the washroom when I heard a noise outside the window. I went out into the kitchen and looked out the window - there was  a young guy in a hoodie and ballcap running from the neighbours' property and ducking down behind their truck. It looked like he was pulling the plates off of it and their minivan, so I grabbed Debbie's phone and dialled 911 to report it. But it became more urgent when I saw him pull out a gun and point it across the street. Another guy in a hoodie showed up with another, larger gun. I was seriously rattled. The emergency dispatcher was very calming, and the police were there in just a few minutes and had the guys down on the ground. They were probably pellet guns but after that incident on the tracks a few months ago I can't be too sure. And at the very least they were on private property in the middle of the night (from the bathroom it sounded like they were on the gravel along the side of our house, not just the neighbours' place.)

I was going to go to sleep. Now I'm all shaking. But thank god I decided to check what was up. The dispatcher said they'd phone me back at my number if they had any questions or details.
