I never thought that it would be this hard. That letting go of something that never existed could hurt so much. But every day I find it harder and harder and I just wish that I had actual friends because I'd think a lot less about you and being in your arms.

And then I am in your arms and in your thoughts but now, its almost too late. Every time we touch I get this feeling, that its all fake, that it is just to pay for your mistakes. I don't want to be just another mistake in your book. You can't go to rehab for me. I can't save you from yourself. I can't even save me from you. 


There's so much pain and its so one sided. If I could tell either of you how i feel maybe life would be different. If I didn't want what I couldn't have life would be easier, but would it be worth it? Is it worth it now? Maybe I shall no longer go on after this weekend. There is only so much pain one can take, and maybe this is the limit. Maybe, just maybe, I will wake up from this nightmare and you will just be a passing thought. When I'll actually just wake up, and still be in just as much pain.
