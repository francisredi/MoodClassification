Oh My God, Just SHUT UP!
If I hear the words 'Wayne', 'Rooney' or 'metatarsal' again this week, in any particular order, I am going to scream.&nbsp; If you care that much, just be grateful he didn't break his fucking neck, and move on.

Yeah, I'm not having a good day today.&nbsp; I am trying to prepare for my interview tomorrow, and putting together my Record of Achievement, I have discovered that I've lost my A-Level certificates.&nbsp; My fucking A-Level certificates!&nbsp; It may just be me, but they seem like quite an important thing to have.&nbsp; Now, fair does, I have had 5 years to put them in the damn folder and failed to do so, so some or all of the responsibilty for this may lay with me, but I'm not in the mood.&nbsp; I'm just screwed.&nbsp; I have my statement of results from AQA, but that only has German, History and Media Studies on it, no English, so not only does it make it look like I only got 2 A's and a C, it makes me look like I regard Media Studies as an actual academic subject, as opposed to a complete waste of time.&nbsp; Coupled with the fact that it has 'This is not a certificate' stamped across the bottom, I'm starting to think this doesn't look good for me.&nbsp; Weirdly, I'm actually more annoyed about the loss of my&nbsp;'Outstanding Achievement in English Literature and Language Combined' certificate from the A-Level awards.&nbsp; It wasn't an exam, they just gave it to me - it was the one thing that I was proud of.&nbsp; Something has gone seriously wrong with my 'filing of important stuff' sytem.&nbsp; Not to mention the fact that I was supposed to bring all the stuff I've had published, nay, just published work, like it's a prerequisite for getting on the course, and I don't know where mine is.&nbsp; I never kept the stories from the books and magazines, and I've only managed to salvage one tiny article, without my name on it from my stint at the Yellow Advertiser - as far as I recall, I was in a bad mood one day and decided to throw all my articles out.&nbsp; After not keeping them very well and having them scattered in random draws to start with.&nbsp; Fuck, I am so screwed.&nbsp; I have to explain gaping holes in my qualification records, employment history, and published work.&nbsp; Screwed, screwed, screwed.&nbsp; I bloody hope I can charm my way through this thing tomorrow.&nbsp; Am so very, very nervous.&nbsp; If you're reading this before 3pm on Wednesday, please - pray for me.
