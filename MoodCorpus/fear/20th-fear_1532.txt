Hurr-i-pains
Oh yeah.

I bought a shitload of shit to prepare for potential evacuations this morning.  Candles, flashlights, gallon jugs of water, wet napkins, phone cards, a road atlas, a cat carrier for Theo, etc.  I'm picturing my evacuating vehicle with mild amusement - a backseat full of three cats, a computer swaddled in blankets in the trunk, a file folder full of all the important documents I wished I had last year in the front seat.

The first storm of the season has been named - Arnold, I think? - it's headed toward Florida.  I'm a little bit freaked.  The issue isn't this particular storm, it's the sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach that I felt upon seeing that angry red boil on a weather map.  I'm surprised at how much my attitude has changed since last year.  I would have laughed (in fact, I think I did) had anyone suggested that I buy actual *supplies* for even the process of evacuating.  

I'm somewhat nervous about everything.  I know the statistical probability of something similar to Hurricane Katrina happening is incredibly slim, but...I simply don't feel like I can go through this again.
