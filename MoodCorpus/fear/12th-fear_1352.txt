lost and destroyed...
though i am sure all of this is what was planned by her, i can't help but worry about brittany. god, just saying her first name is foriegn to me. i love her dearly and can't even talk to her because she said she doesn't even want to here my voice right now. i'm so scared! i spent three years to build up a trust with them and i lost it in less than two days! what did i do to deserve this punishment? all i wanted to do was help them get through this...
i now think i know why this is all happenening... me and waya thought of this: the dad's name was gene, correct... well just try to envision it through mama hawks eyes'... gene with brittany sound kinda painful if ya ask me. i think she's shunning me from brittany because she can't bear to thinkl about gene anymore, but of course that's why i had them create psykes. and is so, is she maybe forcing brittany to do this by telling her she wont ever see her brother again unless she leaves me... if so, i know that feeling because my dad used my mom as the same kind of leverage... but i still don't know for sure and i'm just waiting for those few answers that only brittany can provide me... eternity is long--i have the patience...
