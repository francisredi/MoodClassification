The Move
Well, we have to be out tomorrow and I'm supposed to be doing homework.  I wonder if it's too late to see if I can't get these postponed or put on hold until this is over.  I don't have the heart to read up on marketing strategies or any of that stuff.

I'm scared, I'm honestly scared.  In my mind, we've wasted so much time trying to shop for appliances and there just isn't enough packed.  We got a late start this morning, since mom apparently has this fear of frost.  >_>  We only got one real load of junk taken over before we went to pick up some sand to tame the mud outside our doors, get Luna, and get this pathetic little load.  Then we spent forever talking with Maryann before we finally managed to get away.

*sighs*  The movers are going to eat us alive and mom has it in her head that she can get them to let us stay here overnight tomorrow.  (Hello!  Tomorrow is our LAST DAY!)

What's more is that my entire damned domain is down.  Dr2/Mesopia/Netbunch decided it was time for another name change and "sold" the company to yet another host.  So, my domain is down with little more than a cheesy announcement declaring the "sale" to serve as warning.  ("No downtime" my ass.)

So, it's more LiveJournal drama for me to post.  (Hey, it's cheaper than the therapy I'll probably need by the time this is all over)

Poor Jodi, her mom had a stroke yesterday and she's had maybe 2 hours of sleep in a 24 hour period. Her mom can't even talk anymore, well... she can, but it comes out garbled.  The rest of her functions seem normal, though Jodi says she's rather impulsive at the moment.  My Great-grandma Roosa (we call her "non") was too after her stroke, come to think of it.  Apparently Mrs. Haveman has been having mini-strokes for a while.  At least she didn't have the major one Non did.  *sighs*  It broke my heart to see my friends so upset.  It really did.  I started crying when Jodi did, though I tried hard not to.
