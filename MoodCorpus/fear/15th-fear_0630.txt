first time for everything.
Well this is my first time using live journal.  I made an account because Myspace and facebook just weren't enough.  I think that I just need more ways to get myself away from school.  I feel like it's consuming me, like I'll never be able to escape.  I just keep hoping that someday all the work I have done will pay off.  My biggest fear is that after all this schooling and work and support from my parents I will never succeed.  I just need to be more confident and know that whatever happens is god's will.
        Pretty soon my life will be very different.  I will have a step mother, two step brothers, and a whole new side of the family.  I love all of them.  My older stepbrother to be David is going into the navy not soon after the wedding.  I am so nervous for him.  I cried in church once just thinking about praying for him once he left.  He's so closed, I don't know if he even likes me very much, or whether he'll miss me.  I will miss him so much, I'm afraid to even tell him how much I will miss him.  He is the step brother that I feel the most comfortable with, and yet he is leaving so soon.  I hope that when he leaves, he will understand how much I, and the rest of his family love him.  If anything were to happen to him while he was in the navy, I'm not sure what I would do.
        I've felt so lonely lately.  I miss how I felt when I was going out with someone.  That feeling that no matter how gross you look or feel, someone always thinks that you're beautiful, and will tell you so.  I don't want to be in a relationship just to be in one, I think I just need someone right now.  I need someone who I can tell my hopes and fears.
