I feel so awful
I was told just before X-mas that I need surgery. I need a hysterectomy and my bladder needs to be repared, I am constantly peeing my pants. It has now been 3 months and still no surgery, the insurance is fighting whether I really need these procedures. I have been cramping really bad since I was 16 years old and it has only gotten worse. I have been in a depression since the first denial and have gained like 20 pounds in these 3 months which only makes the depression that much worse. And the bladder problem is getting worse too. I can just be sitting down doing nothing and I'll start to leak. I am so embarrassed that my love life with my husband is suffering. I just don't know what to do any more. Oh and now I have another lump under my arm that is growing fast and it hurts really bad. I have an appointment on Wed to have it removed. About a month ago I had a cyst like that removed from my butt and I know it is going to hurt even more under my arm. So that is how my life has been for the last while I am in pain most of the time and I pee my pants.
