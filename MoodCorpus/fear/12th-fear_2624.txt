11
My grandma keeps having diabetic episodes

yesterday missy found her on the floor and had to call 911. she said she was so scared that she almost went into labor.

then, after i tried to forget about it last night 

it happened again this morning when i got home. 

mom is there now

She only needs 1 shot of insulin and she's perfectly fine -- but this is the second time 911 had to be called in 2 days.

as far as i know, she's being kept overnight and is fine right now. like she has an infection or something that is causing her blood pressure to drop and her sugar to drop. but its a little worrying that it keeps happening when people might not be in the house >_<

my dad says to put her in a nursing home. but we can't afford to send me a college, or eric to college, so how are we going to afford 700000 for her to live in a nursing home with shady ass people and teenagers taking care of her? i don't want that to happen.

i'm probably going to skip my classes on wednesday and thursday to stay at home before the boston trip. 

but anyway. i'll be home all day. if anyone gets bored or wants to call me to talk. i need someone to help me forget about things right now...
