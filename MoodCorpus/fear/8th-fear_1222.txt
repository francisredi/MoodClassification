Dream
I am extremely tired and extremely bored not to mention more than alot disturbed and upset right now. 

I had the worst dream ever last night. u_u;; Which I've cut for those of you who don't care.

 

I had a dream last night that my mom tried to kill herself. I got a call from an unknown person. The voice was rather deep, almost demonic like. 

"Your mother will be dead soon" It said. 

So I hung up, called an ambulance and rushed home. When I got there she looked absolutely insane and was in her bra so I could see all of these deep self inflicted cuts all over her body. She wasn't acting at all like herself and I was just praying the ambulance would get there soon. After about ten minutes of her speaking crazy and me trying to fix her on my own I wonder outloud where the ambulance is. And then she tells me in this scary type of voice that it had already been there and she had sent them away. My mom went on to tell me what a failure I was so in essence, I had done this to her. Horrified I call again and I guess I started crying in my sleep and it woke me up. 

So yeah...that was it. >_>;; 

I'm still shaken up. 

I need things to take my mind off of that. Any takers?
