One more time...
I have an interview with the Dept of Transportation in the morning and I'm scared. Not just nervous but absolutely to the pit of my soul scared. Scared of what you ask? I'm scared of this being another dead end. It seems like every job lead I have ends up a dead end. That company that sent me my cell phone? I haven't started working them yet but they saw it fit to spend $438 to send me a phone! I don't get it. A temp agancey called me last week saying that they had  a client wanting to hire someone for a position within the week and all I had to do was come in and take a test to make sure I was qualified for the job. Okay, I took the test, passed, called them evryday to check up on the status of that position and here it is a week later and still nothing. 
I don't want to go through another year of unemployment! This can't possibly be it for me but I have this feeling that if I don't get this job.... No. I can't think like that. I have to press on no matter what. I have no choice. Either I keep going and live or give up and die!
Say a little prayer for me would you?
