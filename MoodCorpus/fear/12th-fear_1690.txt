I pooped clumps of blood AGAIN. this time, I scooped up a sample, put it in a baggie, and brought it to the doctor's.
the awesome nurse told me that I was smart for doing so :)

they said that my poop was abnormal, so they did a rectal exam by sticking a gloved finger up my ass then wiping the gloved finger on this little piece of paperr thingie. it didn't hurt, but when I made a face, the nurse giggled.

afterwards, I was sent off to the lab. they took three vials of blood from a vein in my right elbow. 

also, they did a x-ray of my abdomen. I was allowed to keep my nipple piercings in. they only took one shot and when I looked at the x-ray, I could see streaks of black stuff on my upper right side. no idea if it was food or something icky.

I was sent home with instructions to drink clear liquids and eat toast, applesauce, bananas, and rice and to stay away from dairy products. they also told me to go to the emergency room if I pooped blood again.

being the cooperative patient I am, I bought a huge bottle of water and ate some applesauce (which was chunky and I already dislike applesauce so I was kinda gagging as I ate).

mike's like "OMG YOU HAVE CANCER!" gee, thanks for making me feel better.

at home, I tried to poop... and little bits of fecal matter surrounded by bright red blobby streaks of blood came out. it all was painless.

so I'm stuck at the emergency room now and yeah, I'm getting more scared.
