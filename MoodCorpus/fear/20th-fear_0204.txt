Slightly drunk
I have to go to the dentist tomorrow for my first root canal ever.  From everything I have heard of them, I am dreading the procedure.  While I recognize that the procedure is necessary to end the low-grade toothache I've had for several weeks now, I am quite frankly scared.

Please understand -- I am nearly phobic when it comes to dentists.  To be fair, this particular practice seems to have built a clientele around the idea of (as one co-worker who also uses them) catering to whiners.  They bend over backward to ensure that you are comfortable, that you have the latest and greatest amenities available throughout your visit, that there is never a reason to fear their bedside [or in a dentist, should that be "chairside"?] manner.  

But I feel this evening as though I will be facing the executioner's axe in the morning.  So I bought a bunch of extravagant foodstuffs, and I have a big bottle of wine left over from a recent visit to my dearest friends in the world, and I'm bingeing tonight.

Anybody wanna take this root canal for me?  Anybody?
