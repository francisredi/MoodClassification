Just Getting Started
Well, this is my first entry and I'm sure I'll be making a mess of things until I figure things out. 

I'm not a happy camper at the moment, my big gelding Tyr coliced this morning. We had to walk him forever. He finally started to feel better and now I'm sitting here worrying about him. 

My husband's mare (Tyr's daughter Trixie) tangled with one of the T-posts in our pasture on thursday and we had to get the vet out to sew her up. She had to get 10 stitches in her shoulder, and she's injured her knee so badly we're afraid she'll be lame for the rest of her life. We also have to keep my mare, Vic in the same vicinity as Trixie otherwise she gets really upset and might do more damage to herself fussing. We have to go out every night to clean her shoulder and re apply the topical dressing. This is complicated since my husband can't stand the sight of the wound, so he just holds Trixie while I clean it out. Thank god its not infected yet. And I get to be the one to take out the stitches. I am so not looking forward to that...

Finally, my beloved dog Lady had surgery on tuesday. She had cancer on her spleen. Doc said it was the largest spleen he'd removed from a dog her size. She was 79 lbs and her spleen weighed 9 lbs. If we hadn't taken it out, she would have died. We don't know if she'll be alive 3 months or years. We just have to take each day as it comes, and hope doc got all the cancer out. She was doing really well until yesterday. We had a bad night. Lady's a german shepard and she has a breed related problem, her spine is partially fused and last night she got really weak in her hindquarters on top of recovery from the surgery. I was so worried I spent the night on the couch, just to be close to her. She's doing a bit better now. I got her to eat something, drink a bit and actually went out into the backyard to potty. Its so hard because she never lets on when she's in pain. She's a tough girl.
