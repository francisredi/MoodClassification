Doctors Appointment
I went to the doctor today. I was nervous and wanted to cry when the lady asked for my medicare card. Ive been prescribed to another pill but I need to stay on this one for another 2 weeks, until my cycle is over. Then Im to go in for an ultrasound to make sure my ovaries are ok and to try to figure out why I get so much period pain. There isn't much he could do for my depression except change the type of pill I was taking. He said the pill is more likely to cause moodyness in women rather than depression but it is possible with a history of depression. So he thinks the pill has brought out the depression of what Ive had before. Only time will tell whether takeing me off the pill will help at all, since I refuse to go on medication.

Ive never gone to my family doctor about my mental issues, in the past Ive gone to doctors I didnt know because I was afraid of people finding out, so I went in secracy. After I filled Greg (my family doctor) in on my past mental health, saying that Ive refused medication before, he said that he finds the medication doesn't help with artisitic people and rather wears them down so that going on the meds while I was at uni would have helped my depression but most likely wouldn't have helped with keeping my passion for music alive. That really comforted me.
