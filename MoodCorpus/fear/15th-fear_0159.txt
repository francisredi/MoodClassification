BUG SAGA: THE NEXT GENERATION

For those of you who remember, I used to post about the bugs who invaded my room in Ohio.  You can check the memories for all of that stuff.  Anyway, today the second part of the saga began, with the visit of a fast nasty jumping spider the size of a fucking quarter in the My Little Pony Dream Castle that I have on my dresser.  I had to slowly take out the ponies and makeup and carry the castle gently to the porch, where the spider was shooed away with a straw.  It was the kind of arachnid beast that makes you shudder and shriek like a little girl every time it shifts position, because of the speed with which it moves.  I swear, the chelicerates have secretly invented teleportation.

There were points before, but since I have moved, I feel it is pertinent to start with a blank slate.  This invasion was particularly insidious, because it threatened my precious ponies, and therefore the spider team gains a bonus.  And so, the score is:

BUGS - 2
