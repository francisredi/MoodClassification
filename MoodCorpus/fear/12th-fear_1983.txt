I'm scared. My spanish Oral is in 6 days. I have no clue for my EE. History=hell. English=hell. I hate journals. Karb needs to die. Photo is hell because of her and solely because of her. I love art and math. I loved photo too but that was before it became bull shit. Im scare about my grades. i dont know if there is anything that I can do to bring up my grades before the end of the term. I have a B in math and I can get that to an A no problem if I just make up a test which is on my agenda for tomorrow. History is pretty much a lost cause. I had so much late work and a couple of missing assignments. I am thinking I can pull of a D and perhaps a C. I don't know. Lets see...English I have a D...Photo I have an F, spanish I have a C, and art I have an A. I'm so freaking scared. All of this stress is killing me. I just want to curl up into a ball and cry. Oh wait...I did that already. I'm so freaking out about my oral. not the oral itself, the conversation after it. Ugh...I am going to do history homework.
