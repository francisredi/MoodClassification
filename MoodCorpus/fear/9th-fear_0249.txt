sooooo.
this semester sucks. i just hate it. everyone seems to be hating it. its just so much different than last semester, the vibe is much...more gloomy. it's boring. it's lonely. the only thing to look forward to is only 3 more months until another long ass summer break.
i'm taking a break from studying bio right now. got my first test tomorrow. sooooooooooo many notes to know. but i think i'll do well on it, as long as it's strictly based on the notes like he said it would be. he's a really cool professor, i def. lucked out. lab on the other hand, that's another story. i dont know what the hell is ever going on in there. my professor just kind of sits there and doesnt explain anything, she's only there if you have a question. and im like umm yeah i got a question, what the hell is going on?
all of my other classes are ehhh. i havent really been assigned any work yet. wednesday however, is my first day of observations at caldwell elementary school in springfield. i'm quite anxious to see how that's gonna go. it's gonna be tough to just sit there for 6 hours though.
as for everything else going on in my life. i'm not happy. i've become like the emo girl in the group now and i hate it. i know i have to keep just trecking along, but it's so hard. my friends are really keeping me together.
sigh.
