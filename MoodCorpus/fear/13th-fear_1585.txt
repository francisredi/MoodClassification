Have you ever been so afraid of someone else that you can do nothing but cower in the smallest, darkest corner you can find and cry? Have you ever felt so weak, so insignificant that you don't reach out to people because you are afraid that they'll reject you and leave you with your pain?

I'm scared, so terribly frightened and shaken up. I'm so lonely that I hurt and I can't breath. I want to get away from this place but I'm too scared to go out into the main part of the apartment, and my room doesn't have a window large enough to escape through. 

Dad is scaring me. He is out in the main room, waiting. 

"You're mine! Don't you understand that!? You are MINE! And NO ONE will change that!"

His exact words. This is not the first time that he has said this to me. 

I should have known that it was strange that he let me skip school but wouldn't let me leave during the day. 

I feel sick to my stomach.

I want to call for help, but I've alienated the only people I can call, either by hurting them or severing my ties with them. They don't want anything to do with me. 

Help me. Someone. Please.
