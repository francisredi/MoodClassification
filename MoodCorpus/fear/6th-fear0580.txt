Throwin' Down
Those of you who don't read Michael's journal as well as mine are blissfully unaware of a certain war that I have been escalating with my big mouth (fingers?).  This has been going on for a couple days now, and some colorful words have been exchanged, to say the least.  This has been mostly between Michael's closest friend's fiance and me, with Michael tactfully saying some stuff in the beginning, and then not-so-tactfully adding his two cents later.  Now his friend has called him, and he's afraid his friend wants to punch him.  If he should punch anyone it's me.

Even though I feel justified in everything I said, I feel guilty that I actually said it.  I should have been the better person.  I should have stopped rising to her bait and sat on my hands.  But, those of you who know me know that I can't keep my mouth shut or my fingers still.  When I have something to say, I say it.  In some arenas this has earned me respect.  My folklore friends have lovingly bestowed me with the nickname "The Bulldog" for coming to the defense of one of them at a conference.  And even though I used some colorful language there, I did it in such a way that I seemed to win over even the stodgiest of the scholars in the room.

This time, though, I have probably gone too far.  And Michael will probably pay the price.  I feel so bad, and I don't know how to fix it.  I can't un-say any of it.  I can't apologize to her since I don't feel sorry about what I said to her.  All I feel sorry for is possibly rupturing Michael's friendship.  But that's enough for me to feel really bad.

So now we sit, waiting for his friend to call back.  Now I think I'll sit on my hands.
