What Have I done!
Tuesday Morning and getting ready to move into my new apartment today.  I really really really hope its not a shit hole. Also will be meeting some of the new teachers please God please please let them not be freaks! If it is and the school (which I get to see on Thursday) is a shit hole I think I might have to pack my bags and leave. Sorry for the dramatic start but last night Helen had a break down and started crying in the middle of Kao san street - something to do with running out of money, having no boyfriend and the unlikely hood of finding one in BKK and being overwhelmed with being here.  Which leads me to think What the Hell have I done! Oh and also found out she is an alcoholic and had a bit of a drug problem - oh great!

Anyway, on the upside, no bills to pay, great food, cheap movies, not waitressing, great shopping, Thai soapies (lots of bitch slapping) and own apartment.  Getting to rediscover what I love about Thailand but also remembering the things I hate like:  traffic, terrible customer service, superficial thais, BKK smell, tripping over holes in the sidewalk, squat toilets and seeing old fat foreign men with young skinny thai girls aaaghhh!

Gotta get going and lug 40 kilos worth of luggage out of storage (the smell makes me want to dry wrtech by the way) into a taxi and out to Sathorn.  Thank God I'm out of Kao San Backpacker central!
