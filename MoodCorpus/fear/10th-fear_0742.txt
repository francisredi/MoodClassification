There are reasons other than lack of romance for my hatred of Valentine's Day
They're always awful days for me. I dunno why.

Apparently dad's not doing all that well. I worry about him something awful. He's about 60 or so, and he says he's already outlived most every man on his side of the family, and he smokes bunches and drinks, both for years and years now. So I worry. He says his back hurts, brother says it hurts him to move around sometimes and he has to go home a lot when they're working together because he just hurts too much from it and that he has some problems breathing every once in a while.

So I worry, and I'm scared. I know it sounds stupid, as a lot of people ahve to deal with more and have loss much sooner in their lives, but...I'm only 18. I don't want to loose my Daddy yet. Especially when I take after him so much, when I'm finally at an age where I can learn the most from him, when I never really got to spend that much time with him growing up...when I don't get to see him much and only want to see and spend time with him.

I'm scared. I love him and I'm scared.
