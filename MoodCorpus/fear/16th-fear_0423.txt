Woke up about an hour ago and am completely nervous about taking my test.  I went online and looked up all the automatic failures for the test.  I should be fine.  Just that Paul told me before that I was making some rolling stops (automatic failure!).  I'm a little worried about the speed one as well.  Cause sometimes I do go too fast and I'm worried about that.

I'm afraid that Paul might not even be AROUND when I take my test if his car is still getting fixed.  Likewise, if it does get fixed and I end up not needing Dan & Petya's help, I'll feel badly about asking them to come.  I'm sure they would be excited to see me get my license, but I'm also pretty sure they won't have had any sleep since getting off work at 7 this morning.  Not if they're coming here at 10:30.  They're gonna be all SLEEPY.

I feel bad about everything now don't I?

Just everyone hope, pray, send good will that I won't be a ball of nerves for this test and can relax a little (but not too much, because the nerves will keep me on my toes about the rules).

I should probably eat something, but am so nervous!
