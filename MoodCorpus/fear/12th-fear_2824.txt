I am really really freaked right now.

I was listening to my "Another Brick In The Wall (KORN version)" and had just logged back into to yahoo messenger from when it kicked me out. I just put my headphones on and was listening to the song. When I hear a weird and scary yell and then my name. I mean I got this weird feeling behind me and I threw my headphnes off and wipt around really fast. Nothing was there, Not a damn thing. The only thing that could be heard was my Rammstein techno remix intro, no voices what-so-ever. I am scared to go to my room now because they house is really dark and kinda scary. I kow that  is baby-ish, but I am really scared. It has me crying for heaven's sake. I want to get through the house so bad right now, but I am so scared. I wish mom or dad would come through the house right  now to go to the bathroom so I can have a light and feel safe. Seriously, I am crying really bad right now, I want my mom and I want to get to me room and go to bed.&nbsp;My safety toy is in my room right now. Yes I have a safety toy. Babs Bunny is in the my room sitting with my stuff on my bed. I keep hearing things now. I know it is the hamster but it is scarying me.Fuck! I thought I saw a face in the kitchen window just then, but nothing could reach that window. FUCK I AM REALLY FUCKING FREAKED RIGHT NOW!!16 more days till KINGDOM HEARTS 2
