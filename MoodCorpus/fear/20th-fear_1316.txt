Mutant Rodent
My cat has a habit of waking me up in the middle of the night by howling desperately at me until I turn on the light. I have discovered that this howl means she has caught something and wants me to praise her for the dead animal she has placed on my chest. It is rather annoying but I must praise her...the way you praise a two-year-old for taking a crap by himself.

At three this morning, I was awakened once again by this horrible, non-stop meowing. I turned on the light and there at my feet was a mouse. I went to throw it away and it fucking moved. It was not dead. My cat just injured the poor bastard to the point of certain, painful death. I felt so bad for it. I didn't want it to suffer...so I flushed it down the toilet. Good job, Becky. Now I have this fear that it didn't die. It has turned into a mutant rat. I am afraid to go to the toilet. I am afraid that a giant, pissed off mutant rodent will jump up my ass and kill me slowly.
