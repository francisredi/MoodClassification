The lift horror /_\
Yesterday, I took a lift to leave a building, which is very busy and has many computer shops in it. It was about five, and people was everywhere on every floor. Strange that there was nobody in the lift at that time. The lift was very usual and not a big one, and it had large mirrors on the three sides. 

I've taken many sorts of the lifts, but this was my first time to be in the lift like that. The mirrors reflected each side in it, and which looked like the space had expanded endlessly or something in design magazines. I know it sounded quite normal but at that time I had a weird feeling. That reminded me a Korean horror film, where a woman was killed by her reflection on the mirror in a lift, and I was horrified. (>_<) The reflection of 'expanded' space seemed very unpredictable, something might appear far away and come to attack me in any time. The time from 11 floor to the ground passed so slow....Finally, the lift stoped and the door opened. I walk out of the lift immediately! 

I know I was scared by my imagination. :(
