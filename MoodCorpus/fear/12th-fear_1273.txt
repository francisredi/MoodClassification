Time is close
Well only a couple more days now. Then i get to get cut open and have all the evil released. haha..yeah right. ima always be evil. anywho. Getting kind of nervous. I hate hospitals, i hate doctors. They told me i was in perfect health other than what has to be done..so why can't life just leave me alone. see i do fine without having to ever visit those places. eh. oh well, ima hoping this is the last time i ever have to go to the hospital for anything like this. In other new. I might be getting a new companion. A pit bull named ribsey. He is soooooooooooooooooooooooo adorably cute that i just can't resist and have to adopt him. So i might go tomorrow and get him. We'll see, at least he could keep me company while i recoop from my surgery. Justin wished me well on my recovery and of course Nikki doesn't want me to go. lol, but i tell her i have to. hehe. So anyway, probably won't be able to sleep much the next couple days. Ima be stressed and nervous. but oh well. other than family, tony, jason, justin and nikki, no one else really seems to care. of course i guess thats fine, i wasn't really expecting anyone else to care. lol they'll probably hope i don't wake up and be able to say "yay, we got rid of craig once and for all" i know that would make all you happy. hahaha. but aint gonna happen. Justin and i have plans, and i have to go out and visit nikki this summer so there. ok, well ima go for now. Kind of tired and just feeling blah. i'll probably write something after the surgery if im up to it.
