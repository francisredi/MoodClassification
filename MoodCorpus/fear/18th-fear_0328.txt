It's been ages since I've posted anything. But, I'm going to be up for a while... so what the heck. I had a phone interview earlier today... very interesting. I don't honestly remember a single word I said. So, most likely, I sounded like a complete moron. I'm competing with 2 other people for the internship. I really want this, but, if it's not meant to be there isn't much I can do. (I may sound ok about all of this, but that couldn't be further from the truth. I'm nervous as heck and scared that I won't be good enough and blah blah blah I should stop putting myself down).

That last statement is something I've heard a lot of from Jay lately. I guess I just figure that if I prepare myself for the worst, it won't hurt so much if it doesn't go the way I want it to. Likewise with the possibility of Jay living with me for the summer. I guess if I tell myself that he'll say no, I won't be as sad about it. It'd be a 2 1/2 month long vacation for him from home, but is he really ready to spend that much time with me? Him moving in with me is a huge test of our relationship... it'll either make it or break it. I'd prefer that things work out for the best and that we'd be able to work through any conflict that arises, but eek!

I don't want to think about us not being together. Thinking about where the hell I'm going to work if Sanofi doesn't hire me is enough stress for one night. 

Did you know that stress and anxiety make you gain more weight quicker than eating nothing but banana splits? So, I'm figuring that tonight I will be gaining about 15 lbs. 

Regardless of what happens, I'll post tomorrow. So, keep your fingers crossed and PRAY!!!!!
