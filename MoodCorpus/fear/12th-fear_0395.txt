I have an anxiety disorder.&nbsp; Those of us with anxiety disorders function best with a large amount of structure in our lives.&nbsp; That means that effective communication is extremely important.&nbsp; I need to feel in control.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I feel out of control; hence the anxiety, I get agitated, upset, panic-y and what not.&nbsp; If I start to feel out of control of the situation (i.e. unable to get a hold of a person, mismanagement of money and so forth) I freak the fuck out.&nbsp; I get keyed up and I get more and more and more worked up until there is some resolution.&nbsp; Those who are close to me should know this.&nbsp; What has me upset is that I shouldn't have to be feeling this way tonight.&nbsp; It is called consideration.&nbsp; It is called understanding that this kind of crap sets off my mental&nbsp;triggers and therefore causes me to feel really miserable.&nbsp; It is inconsiderate.&nbsp;&nbsp;I took a Buspar not too long ago and I'm feeling a little better but the "out of control" feeling and the feeling of frustration associated with that is still lurking there but just muted.&nbsp; I'm getting angrier by the second but I'm doing alll I can to distract myself.&nbsp; I think I'm going to try to go to bed soon.&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, I'm just hurt, frustrated and just generally miserable.&nbsp; So much for trying to remain positive.
