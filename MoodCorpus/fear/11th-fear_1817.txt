I'm SO nervous!!!
First of all thanks to !!! You're so awesome! Thanks so much for uploading the album and posting it. :) You get 5 stars for that!!

I'm so nervous right now. Tomorrow morning is the big Tim & Faith presale and I'm freaking out about it. The Xcel Center hasn't posted a seating chart for the show, so I'm using Shania's seating chart as a guide. Hopefully they'll have one posted by tomorrow - I doubt it - losers. It also sucks because it's through ticketmaster - ticketmaster can be so evil sometimes. I did find a link that someone posted on Tim's fan club board of a more detailed look of the stage and it's crazy! I have NO idea what kind of seats I should go for. Or whether I should take the first seats I get or keep looking. ugh! 

I don't want to get floor seats and then find out it would have been better sitting in the lower section and vice versa. I guess just to be there will be great. I'm thinking of going for floor seats and trying to be as close to the stage and catwalks as possible - so what if I won't be able to see them at various times throughout the show - as long as I'm close when they're by us, I'm OK. PLUS I have my SUPER ZOOM camera. :) I like how it says "No audio/No Video recordings". Whatever! I'll take video if I feel like it. It's not like I'm gonna sell it or anything. And security doesn't scary me! I took some video during Big & Rich last year and the security guard was right next to me - HA! 

Oh, and I have an exam tomorrow too - so that makes me even more nervous. Once I get the presale over and the exam, it'll be smooth sailing for a day. Then I have another exam in a different class on Thursday! Stupid school!!
