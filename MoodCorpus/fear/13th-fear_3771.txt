Just thirteen hours longer...
Before I'll be getting this damn wisdom tooth taken out. It's been a real pain today, and I'm so ready to have it cut out of my head.

It occurred to me as I was pulling into Meijer to get a refill on my antibiotic prescription that maybe the standard dose I get for teeth cleanings isn't enough for a wisdom tooth extraction. It was too late to call my dentist, though, and I didn't have the number on me anyway. I went ahead and got the refill -- I'll ask the oral surgeon if the standard antibiotic dose is enough, and if it's not, I'll call my dentist and ask her to call in a prescription for a stronger/extra dose. I figure the oral surgeon is probably going to give me a prescription for a painkiller of some sort, so I'll be visiting Meijer tomorrow anyway. (Or more likely, Eric will.)

I will be so glad when this tooth is out. Right now, I doubt it will hurt much more after it's out than it does right now.
