Film Shoot, Day 2
Second day of filming.  I am a dissappointing actress.  I can't seem to make my face show the things I want it to.  I feel about to cry sometimes, and my face looks blank.  On top of that, I keep thinking of things I wish I could re do.  In that take, I should have tried this.  I should have heightened the intensity of that one.  I can't tell if the everyone is frustrated with me or not.  They seem calm, but they're also being professional.

I have so much work to do tonight, and my mind is running around in cirlces on a plane of blurry anxiety.  I can't feel breath like I want to.  I can't feel the air on my skin.  I'm afraid I'm slipping into a dead state where I will feel nothing until my life changes again.  I'm always waiting for life to begin, but then I look back over weeks and months and years and find that nothing has happened.  I don't want to waste any more time, but I can't begin my life until I decide which way to MOVE.
