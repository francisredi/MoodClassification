I keep dreaming about getting murdered.

Yesterday it was some weird ritualistic killing by Bielebog and Czernobog, in a world where almost everyone was dead already. But at least Bielebog was nice enough to take the fear away from me first. And all that Czernobog did was put his hands on me and stop my heart. It was very peaceful.

Not last night. No, I'm dragged out of somewhere by my hair, shot with an arrow, then I'm given the chance to survive by what looks like a bloody roman soldier. I beg and plead, and I am scared shitless, but there are people all around and they're kicking and hitting me, and it hurts so much. Then eventually the soldier pushes me over onto my back, and shoots me in the leg. He then proceeds to do this big monologue in Latin, while I'm howling in pain and terror. Luckily I then woke up. 

My dreams are starting to piss me off. If babies aren't getting raped, I'm getting murdered or attacked by sharks. I thought this Valerian stuff would help, but noooo. Bastards.
