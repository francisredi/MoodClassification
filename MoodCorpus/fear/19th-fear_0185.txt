Nervous about BM
i'm really really nervous about BM. I shouldn't be because this is my only vacation i will get this year. I need to enjoy it to the fullest and not be so freaken freaked out. But i am. I can't help it. they keep saying shit about cactus's pines getting in your feet, and ants, and scorpions and just a bunchy of negativity stuff. I liked the old grounds. I knew what to expect there. here i don't. I like surprises but not lately to much. Lately, i been more concrete on the way things are. I want to know what is coming. My levelity in myself has gotten more sturdy. I am doing much better, but this BM thing is really got me worked up. Everyone else seems to be so excited, i feel as if i am the only one stressed about the what could happen things, of which would ruin the fun times. 
Everyone is like: yay! its almost here! I'm like: oh god, its almost here. I'm broke and its almost here. I have lots i still have to get. Shit, its almost here. Get paid tomorrow, and i plan on getting everything i need with that paycheck, and well bills..are gonna have to get paid late. Sucks ass how finances have been going lately. I just am trying to express how much i am nervous and stressed about this! It just isn't going to be the same. Thats what i think makes me the most nervous. I knew what to expect last year. This year..well its all your on your own thing, and don't know what the hell to expect.
