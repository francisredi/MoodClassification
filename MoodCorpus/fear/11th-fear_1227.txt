all these career-pertinent decisions i have to make lately are stressing me out.  i am scared, in a very wimpy sort of way.  i'm so lucky to have all these opportunities, but at the same time i feel a little as if i'm jumping off a cliff into space.  i'm not sure i have had such a time period before where the decisions i make and the places i choose to go or the courses i choose to take could have such an impact on my future.  or perhaps i have had such a situation before but perhaps it only seems really relevant and important when you are right in the midst of it.  i feel like i've been waiting for most of my academic life for this next year and i'm nervous about setting off on this path now when i am faced with the actual "fork" in the road.  while i know that things are never written in stone, i am now at a point where i will be accountable and judged on my actions and my knowledge and character by strangers whose opinions could have a big influence on my success in my industry.  to some extent i already have been and that freaks me right out too. 

wow this is not helping this is just hyping me up.  i feel spoiled and whiny.. but i'm still scared regardless.  oh, and also excited.  


also.  i'm trying to discover a niche within my horsey world that i could handle and still have some life outside horses..  and potentially work for both clinics i want to.  i'm trying to decide how a "contract horse vet" would work out.. (no, to any of my less horsey friends that is NOT the same thing as a contract killer, or an assassin :P) that way i could possibly do some continuing education during the winters while caseload is lower.. so i wouldn't have to do an internship necessarily but i could work on getting my chiropractic certification and also go to some of the big referral clinics to keep my brain working and keep learning (cause i'm all about the learnin doncha know.. just less about the studyin)..
