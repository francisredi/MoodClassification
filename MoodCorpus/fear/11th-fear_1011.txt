I got so tires last night that I ended up passing out around 10pm (the earliest I've been to bed at in quite awhile) when I was supposed to play FFXI with my friend; I felt bad about that but even worse when I couldn't pull myself out of bed (over 8 hours of sleep and I was still tired).  I think that was the catalyst for wanting to start fights with the family (although not finding my dinner waiting for me to be eaten as breakfast didn't help things either).  I also guess that things in both the car department and school are starting to take its toll as well as I'm suffering failures  as well as finding myself more dependant on others than usual.  

Well, I was right, I bombed that test badly, and to add injury to insult, I bomb the project as well.  Oh well, life goes on...

As for getting a car, I may put that on hiatus until I can get this car examined for repairability - why buy another used car when I already have one in front of me (those things are too big to have lying around doing nothing).  Plus, with my luck finding one and my friend telling me of a true shop that she's been satisfied with, I might as well give it a shot - might be a sign...

Other than that I got a whole weekend of work to do, with three assignments and a 10-14 test to take on Wednesday.  No rest for the weary...
