Worried About Sunday Trip Into Johor Bahru
I am very worried.This Sunday, I am going in to Johor Bahru, Malaysia with my parents and some relatives.A total of 3 luxury cars will be crossing the Causeway.Reasons why I fear our trip:1) The immigration officers from Malaysia side usually demand Singaporeans to give "tips" from those riding in big cars.2) Many highway robbers are stationed all over Johor to rob from Singaporeans.3) Scared our cars are being scratched at the car parks at the shopping centres.I am more scared of 2) then anything else. On Monday, Shin Ming Daily News reported that a man was driving a Mercedes on the road when a group of Malaysian robbers were trying to outrun him in their car. One of the robbers even flashed a long parang knife through the window to scare him! Another pointed to his tyre, hoping that the Singaporean driver would stop his car and check his tyre.Gosh! Going to JB is like going into the tiger's den.
