OK, so I had a weird dream where there was like a blizzard outside, and everything turned pitch black. I was leading Brittany around, and we were in  like a hotel or something, and I was trying to look for Todd, strangely enough. (By the way, I still feel sorry for him) I went to like five different rooms before I found his. No, wait. Actually, I found his room, and THEN I found Brittany's room in the pitch black. Todd was depressed and just layed in bed, so I just went and got Brittany.. and the way Brittany was acting, was like the song "Can't Stop Now". I swear, that was one weird dream. There were like bars and stuff, and I could see that we were on top of something extremely high up! However, I wasn't really scared. It was weird. I felt like I was rushing to hurry up. In the beginning, they told us about the storm or whatever it was. 

Anyway, I feel sick. Really sick. I guess it's a nervous sick. And this is the last day I have long hair. Hahaha... Guess I'll write back some other time.. Mum will be coming in here soon...
