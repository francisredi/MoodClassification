Day Five
I went to a new meeting tonight and found myself amongst a group of about 50 people. This is by far the largest meeting I've been to so far, and it was surprising, if not a little intimidating. They ended up breaking into four smaller groups for the majority of the meeting, and a very kind lady came up and introduced herself to me and went with me to the meeting for new people. There was a man in there who was less than two weeks out of the hospital for almost overdosing on alcohol and dope. His hands were shaking so bad he couldn't hold his own coffee cup. 

The first three people who spoke all had relapsed at least once - two of them had almost 10 years of sobriety under their belts when they did. And rather than see it as a testament to AA that they were back working the steps, all I felt was discouraged by their stories. This is my first and hopefully only attempt at getting sober. I don't want to relapse. The fact that people can go for so long and be so seemingly "strong" in their sobriety, then crash and burn is terribly discouraging. I couldn't help thinking they were weak.

Now that I'm back at home I'm feeling overwhelmed by it all. This is so much to take in that I actually feel its weight. So many women have come up to me now in various meetings and been so kind and sweet and genuine towards me that I'm overwhelmed by their actions. After the things I've done to get to this point I feel I don't deserve it their kindness.

I'm starting to recognize faces now. There was a man in the meeting tonight who was also at the meeting I attended two days ago. There was another man who was in the meeting I attended my second day. It's all at once comforting to see familiar faces and incredibly uncomfortable to feel exposed by their stares. Tonight I feel tired and all I want to do is curl up in bed.

I have been sober for 5 days.
