arachnophobia
I just had possibly the worst experience in my time at college just now.  This massive spider was crawling across the ceiling, and I'm of course too frightened to attempt to kill it and my roommate didn't feel like moving to go kill it, so it crawled into this crack where a completely unnecessary metal rod crosses the room.  Now, if there's anything I like less than a spider in my room, it's a spider in my room that I do not know the exact location of at any given moment.  So I freak out, and go to do my homework in the computer lab, but it's all full and no one that I know who might let me use their computer is anywhere to be found.  So I go back to my room and decide to haul my computer up on my bed, which is on the other side of the room.  Before I can do this, though, my roommate and her friend (who would have perfectly willingly killed the spider had she been here minutes earlier) leave for their volleyball game.  Just seconds after the door closes, the spider comes out of hiding and starts moving rapidly alongside of the light.  I freak out and grab my sandal in an attempt to smash it, but after I hit the ceiling where it was at, the spider is found smushed neither on the ceiling nor said sandal.  So, in any case, I'm currently on top of my bed where hopefully the spider cannot attack and eat me.  So now I should actually start my homework so it gets done by Friday.
