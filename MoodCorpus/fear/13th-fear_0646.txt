I wish I could write about Dirty Ink or the way Hell has in fact frozen over-- today was my first experience with Hail in San Francisco and it scared the crap out of me! Hail is weird and I think it kind of freaks me out.

I don't know. I'm still worried that soon everything is going to blow up in my face. Something just doesn't feel right. I am getting that gut feeling that I get before something bad happens. I can't tell if this is paranoia or instinct. It gnaws at me and has all day. 

I have a sneaking suspicion of at least three possible bad scenarios that could happen before this weekend, when we are supposed to meet. What can I do if one of them happens?

I no longer have the energy to hurt myself nor the energy to rebuild myself if disaster strikes. I can't think of a distraction or second plan to get away from this before or after it happens. Then again, I couldn't have possibly dated so many women for all of these years without walking away scarred...I guess i'm seeing the effects of it now. I thought I could use them as fodder for mocking stories and rants, keep moving and dash them beneath me, but now I see that it has left me entirely incapable of trust and filled with fear. 

This just sucks and I want to move into this in confidence. I can't ignore that something doesn't feel right.
