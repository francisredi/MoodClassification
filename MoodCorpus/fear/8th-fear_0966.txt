Life and its little twists and turns
Well, now im back online i can finally off load to something instead of carrying it around with me all the time.

got a bit of a dilema at the moment: to mail or not to mail? that is the question that is doing my head in right now. I mean will i do more damage than good? should I just think sod it and just do it or should i listen to the little voice of fear and doubt and not bother. I mean there are alot of reasons why i shouldn't yet loads of reasons why i should.

If i send this mail what is my fear ? ok It will never get answered and i would have put my whatever out there to get hurt um if i dont im gonna live with a what if, also if i do what is it that im really in all honesty expecting to happen? Could it should it? Can i give what is needed ? Can i get all that is needed? God i am really starting to sound like a comittal phobic if i make anymore excuses inmy head why i shouldnt send it i think ill eventually talk myself into deleting the file and leaving it!!!!!!!!! 

Ok thing is if i send it whats the worse that could happen? He comes bounding back after tearing his life up and i find its not what i want after all? Or two he never replies as that is a possibility too or three he does and its what we both want and face a whole new load of problems after that oh bollocks i dont know what to do but what i do know is its driving me friggin nuts hahaha.

ya know what sod it

Im gonna send it as an attachment with the option of him opening it!? yes no oh poo hahahha

Oh i will because what is the point of me feeling it if i cant say it or share it with the person it concerns!!!! gonna do it now hahaha
