Okay, I know I'm going to get a slap over the head for this one..

The girls at school, who once upon a time never (to my knowledge) had issues with food. Now an epidemic obsession with food has broken out. Today I witnessed first hand, it was agreed that Nicole Richie's 45kg frame was beautiful; that vegetable soup and pumpkin is extremely fattening and that the now ideal weight is between 45 and 49kgs. And the sad thing about it? Initially I was shocked but now I'm starting to believe it! It's so weird, being concious that you're getting brainwashed into thinking a certain way. I'M NOW starting to feel fat and self-concious and now that i'm exercising (purely for stress relief)I'm taking more notice of imperfections. Exercise is suppose to release endorphins and make you have a positive outlook on your body, however the more I exercise and eat healthy...the more obsessed I get.
I've NEVER been one to fuss over my body and its imperfections. I've been comfortable in my body and am never bashful of it. TODAY the girls were picking out things i would of never thought of like their nose was off centre or one leg was slightly fatter than the other...and then they turn to me and ask was there ANYTHING that i would change about my body?? I guess my height...I wouldnt mind being a bit taller...
Then, like a pack of vultures i got savagely attacked. 

"YEAH and like oh-my-god! If your stomach was a bit flatter you would look so model like! AND maybe if your arms were a bit more like...toned! Oh-my-god bronwen you would be like so hot!"

Whoa shit was saying that i wanted to be a bit taller permission to emotionally attack my body!? I didn't think so! But now I've had time to think the day through as in most cases I do..BAH!
