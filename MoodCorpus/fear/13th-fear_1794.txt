Dating Schmating
I have a date tomorrow night. Yes, a real one. And to top that off, it's a blind date. Thanks to Summer and Eric. I thought it was going to be a double date, but Summer has to be cruel and make me do it alone. I just might kick her ass for that. She's been extra bitchy lately. Anyways, this guy works for Eric and he is 20. Apparently he is very excited about it, which makes me even more nervous. I'm meeting him at (of all places) Twistee Treat and then we're supposed to go to a movie. I didn't plan any of this. I don't even know why I agreed to it. 

I'm having second thoughts about staying here when my parents move. SO what if Summer says I would have no backbone if I did. (See what I mean? Cruel!) But the second she found out that I would really stay here and she'd move up there, she changed her tune. I calculated what it would cost to live down here and it's just too expensive for me to live alone. And realistically, it isn't smart for me to live alone without having the two people I trust the most nearby. After talking to my Grandma on the phone last night it hit me...I need to be near her. She's not going to be around forever, and I cannot imagine living so far from her or my parents. I still want to live on my own, but I'm not going to jump into anything. I need to think it through and make sure I am okay with it. Even if I have to live with my parents a little bit longer, at least the want is there and I want to be independent. For a long time I didn't think I would get to that point.
