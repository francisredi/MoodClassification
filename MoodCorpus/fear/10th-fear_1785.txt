The Coming Armageddon>Nuclear World War.
As i contemplate placing another ad on Manline, I placed another channelling on the Shirley Maclaine website, and wait impatiently for my blue globes. I have a three blu globes held at a store for me, I'll pick them up on the 23th, I'll probably buy two more of them. They are neat little globes that glow, i should say illuminate blue light, because they are electrically run. They will give my apartment a more Star Trek atmosphere. I plan to pay my webdesigner to add my new webpage, and to add a Merovingian Mythos link. ///// The new channelling wasn't easy, I can't channel them for long before feeling drained. However when I saw how fast the Bird Flu is now moving I could not help feel a calling from my friends to send a message. Behind the fast moving front of the new Flu, death of dozens of people mark the coming catastrophy. This Flu seems to be making it's ground first, before it unleashes it's more deadly strain. Therefore when the whole world has the Bird Flu, it will quickly move up the food chains, killing Owls, then us. The super-virus is first making it's world nest, from there it will grow upward. I'm certain this will be when the germ warwares will begin, terrorism of biological and chemical propertions large enough to set the Western World's responce with Nuclear weapons against several countries sponcering terrorism. A very clear and very terrible world war is all I can see on the horizon.
