anxious
My life has become an anti anxiety commercial. "do you feel nervious and anxious for most of your day. do you see yourself withdrawing from friends and family? are things that you used to enjoy just not as fun anymore? if so... try......"thats pretty much me. how did I get this way. I need help. how do you choose a psychiatrist? anxiety makes me  this person instead of  this person. I absolutley hate it and Im ready to be able to control it. I recognize that at this point, I need help to do that. I cannot tough my way through this. Apparently anxiety is harder than everything else I have delt with in life. My mom had cancer for a third of my life before she passed away 2 weeks before i graduated high school. My dad had cancer 3 months later and then at Xmas break that year my dr. found cervical cancer in me.&nbsp; aparently anxiety is harder that alll that. because i functioned thought allllll of that. and I can't function anymore!
