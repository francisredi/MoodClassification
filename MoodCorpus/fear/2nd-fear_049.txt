we don't know where we're going, but we'll get nowhere if we've forgotten where we've been.
college is exciting me so much that i almost want to go right this second, but at the same time i'm terrified of it.  i feel so safe right now with the people i know and the home i live in and i'm afraid that when i leave i'll lose it all.  my life right now seems to be a cacophony of dreams all sounding in different directions and i really don't know which to choose.  it's all so confusing.  i just don't want to lose what i know and love because of one decision that means so much.  i never thought i'd be scared of making the wrong choice; i've always been so adventurous and now i'm second-guessing myself too often.  i just wish things didn't seem so complicated.  

i might go to L.A. in january to see some folks about modelling.  that should be interesting.  apparently the woman who i have formed somewhat of a connection with knows elvis's granddaughter and does ads for chanel and stuff.  life is getting crazy hectic and i'm scared to death.

i'm terrified of what's to happen in the months to come.  things need to slow down.  i'm having trouble breathing.
