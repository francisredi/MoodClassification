He has a twin! Named Josh. Josh and Justin. *Laughs* SO CUTE! My attraction grows ever deeper with every shift I share with him. How inconvenient is that? I can hardly work without making side glances at him every now and then like a stupid girl with a crush (which I so obviously am). 

SERIOUSLY, though... I know nothing will come of this. I convince myself of that with every sweet compliment and endearing gesture he pays towards me--but I can't help thinking for one instant, "What if?" What if he has actual intentions? What if he really means to ask me out one day? He's had plenty of chances (I've seen to that), but nothing. Why's he biding his time, then, if he's really and truly interested?

The obvious answer is he isn't. I don't like that answer, but it's less painful to believe that if I turn out to be right in the end. *Sigh* I've been out of the dating loop for so long I just don't know how to handle myself in these kind of situations. I end up looking dorky and confused.

I begin my first serving shift tomorrow *gets nervous*. I know I'm not doing anything too difficult tomorrow; I'm actually just hosting to get my feet wet on the floor. But I'm still as nervous as hell. People have such high expectations of me.

I think... I'm ready.
