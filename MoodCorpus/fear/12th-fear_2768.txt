It's been a while.
I keep forgetting to check the friends page and post in here. Well, the friends it's understandable... All communities and no actual friends, so entries are pretty boring. Not that mine aren't, either, but you know.

I was thinking of what I could have done better in my last duel. Now, one thing was that I could have killed Reflect Bounder using Vampire Lord, but I didn't because I wanted to take less damage and deal more. Using my method, I was able to get in 2000 right off, but if I had used Vampire Lord then I would have only pulled off 1850 damage. I would have gotten both his and Vampire Lady's effect, though... and eventually I would have had my second Vampire Lady, which would have totaled 3400. Then again, though, if he had pulled out Gatling Dragon anyway then there might have been trouble... There's really no saying now.

I have to learn how to think better when it comes to this game. Think faster, think trickier. I should play against my friends more often, but... I'm afraid to. I hate being laughed at, and every time I lose it feels like they're doing just that. It's difficult since nearly everyone I play with has played for longer, and they start to 'advise' me on what to do. Sometimes they mean it to help, but sometimes they only mean it because that's how they would play and the results would still be the same...

Sigh. I guess I'll go up against this deck Rak made just to be a little less of a wuss.
