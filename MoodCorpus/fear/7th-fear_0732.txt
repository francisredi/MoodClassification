Hmmmmmm...... what to wear to meet the parents?  Si just keeps laughing at me when I ask him.  Oh dear.  I'm scared!  Packing is a pain in the arse.  On the other hand stuff with si is amazing at the moment so it should be a really good weekend.  He's gonna show me liverpool on saturday and take me to the Cavern Club in Matthew Street where the Beatles used to play, show me all the beatles stuff etc.  Then we're going home for a bit til dinner, then going to the pub where he worked over Christmas to try this type of beer he's been going on about ever since he worked there. Even if I don't like it i think i'll have to smile and nod on pain of death.

Jess and I cleaned the flat until it shined today and put a very pissed off message on the fridge along the lines of "if it ever gets this messy again we'll shove each and every one of you under a steam train".  I hope they got the message.  

Anyway i must go shower, finish packing etc.  Eeeeep!!!!!!!
