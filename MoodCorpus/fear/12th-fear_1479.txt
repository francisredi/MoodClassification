Invasion of the BUGS!!!!
Man the funniest thing just happened to me!! 
  Okay so i go to use the bathroom, and i am sitting on the toilet seat for like 5 mins (no i wasn't taking a dumb) i was thinking, about my relationship etc. So anyways after 5 mins i look up to reach for some toilet paper, and there is this huge bug on the side of the toilet paper cover! I jumped of the seat so fast, and screamed for my roomate. She came in and killed the bug. 
  Okay yes i am afraid of bugs. No i'm not afraid, i'm terrified! Plus that thing was huge, it was like 4 inches long and had these long antlers that just kept moving up and down. My skin is crawling right now, i'm still thinking about it. I need to take a shower but all i can think about is the dead bug that is lying in the bathroom garbage can. I just can't understand how it got inside because all the windows are closed. I wonder if there are any more lurking around. Man i'm going out of my mind!
   One of my biggest fears are bugs and that one was huge. But you know now that i think about it, if i had to go on a game show like fear factor, and htey threw 100 bugs all over my body. I think i would suck it up and take it, just because i'm getting $50,000 (yall know what i'm saying)lol. Cause when you have student loans to payoff, you find your self doing some crazy stuff.
