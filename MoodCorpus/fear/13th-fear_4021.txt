the dying dream
you dream of things that you want to see. you dream of things you want to happen. you dream of death of birth. you dream of reliving of retrial. you dream of a new beginning of the perfect ending. you dream of the future that you wish could happen. you dream of things you want so your life can be predictable. you want everything planned out. you want everything your way. you want your life to be perfect or less painful. you want to live your life to the fullest so you want to know when you are going to die. you woudln't dream of it any other way. then you have a dream. a dream that changes you, the way you live, and the way you act. you couldn't control this dream. you didnt plan out this dream. this dream was unpredictable. this dream was frightful. you try to wake yourself up, but your eyes wont open they stay shut and you keep witnessing your death. you try to calm yourself down, and start to think that it's just a nightmare all will be better when you awaken. then you start to feel something, you start to yell. you feel the pain that you are going through in your dream. you start to panic. you dont want to die, not in this way. you try to wake up and try to open your mouth and yell for help, but in your dream you are all alone. there's a way out of this dream, and you will find it if you dont die from panic before you figure everything out.
