Never got a call back after my biopsy on breast....
A few years ago I found a small lump in my right breast. That's when I made my firsy gyno appointment ever (2001 or 2002 can't remember). My doctor, at the time, said the lump was a benign tumor/cyst (can't remember exactly which he said). but he wanted me to get a second opinion. So I went to my regular doctor at the time (she's no longer my regular doctor and I only saw her twice)and she recommended I see this breast surgeon she knew, even though she thought the same thing my gyno had. I went to the breast surgeon and they recommended I get a biopsy. 

Anyway, I did end up getting some sort of biopsy on it. They numbed my breasts and then looked for the lump with an ultrasound. A few doctors came in and out to feel the lump. Then they took a needle which had a smaller needle inside. They injected the needle into where the lump was located and the smaller needle inside would jump out and "bite" pieces of the lump off.

To make a long story short, I never found out the results. I assume I would have been contacted if it were something serious. but I never heard. I can't even remember the name of the breast surgeon anymore. Should I be concerned? I've seen a new gyno since then and she hasn't seemed all that concerned about it. We discussed the fact I never fotThe lump is still in my right breast (about the size of a pea) and it hasn't changed since it was discovered.

Should I try to back track and find out what happened? Do you think it's possible for me to find my results out still this long after?

Thanks!
