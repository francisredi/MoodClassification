stress,stress,stress!
Today has been so sressful!!I have been working so hard on my English and Self Pac paces,because tomorrow I should take those tests,and Im trying hard to finish all I can today.But I felt really anxious today while I was working at school.I was sitting at my cubicle,and i was working just fine,and then suddently i feel like I had to take deep breaths,and i started feeling like i was trapped.I took some deep beaths,and it helped a little,but I was still really tense,and my back started hurting because I was so tense.

I still have a lot leaft to do..and I'm  gonna try to finish today at my home,but right now I just want to relax a little.And I also have to study for Spanish,because I have a test tomorrow,AND i have to read a chapter of Don Quijote.I think I'm gonna start doing all those things like at 7:30pm,because I really cant do that now.I can't wait for the Holy Week break,I want to be free from all this school work.But that also worries me,because I have to take a lot of tests before that break,because it's a whole week less of chance for taking tests and finishing more paces.I'm a little behind in algebra and english,and i want to hurry,so i dont have to worry so much when I'm in 11th grade.
