Im not afraid of what Id be gaining, im afraid of what I'd be losing. 
I've never been so scared. Yet, I know that in this im not alone. We're finding faith when we need it the most, making promises to God that if he grants us this ... we will be his forever. Im not even sure if i can put into words how scared i am, im more concerned to how he was acting, I cant handle this if hes scared and weak, yet to be completely honest I cant blame him. He said hed be fine if i told him i hated him, i could never say that, and after this i love him more. We're scared. Were young, we make mistakes, mistakes that we thought wouldnt happen to us. But truth is .. they have. WEre living of off optimisicity, on our knees praying that it will all be okay. Our conversations are kisses on the forehead and saying, it will all be okay ... every minute. He says he regrets, but only because of the malfunction. That made me cry, just hearing the word regret. He couldnt eat, that made me cry more. Should I have to be strong in this? I think im going to have to, but we're hoping for negative, because my options for positive arent to glorious.
