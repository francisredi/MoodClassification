And I'm anxious...
So, I'm anxious about a few things today.

First, my manager and district manager are having their monthly meeting. I hope they come to the colncusion that I should be promoted. If no, I have a lot of work ahead. I'm just sitting here and feeling antsy about the whole thing.

Second, I'm wondering what's going on with Mr. M. I'm never really sure where I sit with him except that he and I are enjoying our time together. And, yes, that's fine with me and I'm really liking it. I just don't know what he's looking for (deep down) and maybe that's a good thing. I can only be myself and take it slowly with him. I have to let go of my pre-concieved notions of dating and just relax and go with the flow. But I'm also really scared of falling this time. I'm scared because I'm not sure my heart can take it again right now and if I let myself start to fall in love then I will have a hell of a time trying to put it back together if it breaks. I have a feeling he's in the same place with regard to having his heart broken and I think that will make it easier... I hope.

So, I'm just a ball of anxiety. I need to get back to work.
