Something new
I want to mention that I'm scared. 
The fact now is that I had since gotten an increase of insulin tonight and now, I've seen a drastic improvement in my blood sugar levels today. From 20.6, to 15.1 and now, it's down to 8.6. That's amazing. An extra five units this evening has really done wonders.
But there may be something more to be concerned about. What if my sugars go lower then 4? Well, I'd be shaking, confused and getting blurred vision. What to do? Well, find something sugary. I'd have to do that fast so that the sugars can rise again and out of the danger level.
So why am I scared? It's never really happened to me with that danger level. I just need the assurance that when the first time it happens, I need to be ready and prepared to have something ready. These things can be frightening as that's what is scaring me. 
I'm sure I'll be fine but I'll only be fine if I know that I'd be ok after the first time.
I'll update you all on how things would go if/when that would happen to me.
