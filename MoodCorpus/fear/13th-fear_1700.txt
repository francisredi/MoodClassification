what a week. the details from my terrible lesson keep bouncing around in my head and i can not keep from focusing on them. i've practiced a little bit but i am afraid i am practicing wrong...so i've just been listening to my pieces lots and hoping that i am doing things right. i do not want to go to my lesson and have another one where i am just not up to par.
on another note st patricks day was interesting. it was predominantly composed of various party hopping with the main event being the bird's. that was a veeery fun party until the cops came and we just went back to the house. but, i drank. i had planned on it too. see with my irish heritage i figured it would be ok if i left my practicality at the door and did for one night. but i realized that i was making this choice out of my own logic and my own devices, not Gods.  my life is not my own, but i am not always aware of this and as a result i do not always act as such.  not even that i am not aware, but that i ignore that faction. that is terrible.
im going to church today and praying for some guidance.
