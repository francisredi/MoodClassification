If you did choose to read this, you're an awesome friend. Please don't think of me any differently.So I was freaking out today. Hardcore.&nbsp; I'm probably losing my job because of my surgery.&nbsp; I don't want the surgery.&nbsp; I never wanted the surgery.&nbsp; I didn't want my car accident, I didn't want to break every bone in my face, I didn't want to lose my teeth, I didn't want the psychological trauma and I didn't want to be ugly.Don't get me wrong.&nbsp; Don't pity me.&nbsp; Everything happens for a reason, I truly believe that.&nbsp; The accident made me a better person in many ways, I grew, developed and matured because of it.&nbsp; Most people who know me probably wouldn't think I'm self-consious at all.&nbsp; I'm pretty outgoing.&nbsp; I lie.&nbsp; I'm only human and I'm fully aware of the scars crossing my once pretty face.&nbsp; I can say I was pretty.&nbsp; I have the right.&nbsp; I used to model.&nbsp; After the accident I stopped getting calls.&nbsp; I'll never forget after the accident when someone said to me, "I'm glad your pretty little face got fucked up.&nbsp; I'm glad you're ugly." It's why I transferred to Quabbin.&nbsp; I needed to start over with people who didn't know me before, people who couldn't compare me to the girl I was.I'm scared - last summer I went in bravely and everyone remembers how I came out.&nbsp; The spacer fell out of my face.&nbsp; Bone is falling out of my face.&nbsp; They messed up,&nbsp; or maybe I did.&nbsp; Either way, the surgery failed.&nbsp; I don't want to chance it again and yet I have no choice.&nbsp; I have a car to keep on the road.&nbsp; I'm out of high school.&nbsp; A job is necessary, and I flat out can not work while I'm on medications, despite the way my physical appearance will be.&nbsp; It's too bad I have to lose my job, I don't think it's my fault.&nbsp; I never wanted it.I'm sorry if someone is still reading this.&nbsp; I just needed to get it out.
