Sylvia
I had mentioned before that I wouldn't be 14 again for all the tea in China and that I tolerate Sylvi's Goth tendancies because I remember how difficult growing up is. I also remember that when I would "Black Out" it was a bad thing... a wall between me and  anyone trying to get too close to me (and it still shows up from time to time). 

I went into her room 2 weeks ago and found that she's writing music (that's my girl) the songs were dark and gloomy... very disturbing... so I tried to spend more time with her one-on-one to see if should talk to me. No dice. I asked her if anything was bothering her (the move and missing her friends, of course) This weekend, I started reading again and found that she's suicidal. She had one of my show knives (that you can shave with, of course) and mentions that she looks at "that vein" and just wants to cut it and end the pain.

I have the knife. The pills are all flushed. (Just Tylenol and Advil but enough to make her sick if she tries to OD.) There are no guns in the house. She has an appointment with Doc on Wednesday for anti-depressants and she sees 3 counselors already so that part of the treatment has already begun.

 What scares me is that she never mentioned comitting suicide. It scares me because neither did I until I tried and failed. Jeff thinks that she's just looking for attention. HELLO?! If she was using it as a way to get back to Pottsville, she would have said she was going to kill herself IF I didn't take her back. I told him that unless he had a razorblade to his wrist or a handfull of pills in his hand, he will NOT understand what she's going through so he should butt out.

You can't understand the Abyss unless you've been there. I want to get her out of it.
