Okay....
Dolly called me yesterday and let me know she bought the tickets and will be arriving on the morning of the 10th.  She leaves on the morning of the 12th.  I then got the room reserved and the money for food ready.

Now I'm on pins and needles wondering just what chance, and how big or small it is, I have of convincing her to stay with our marriage.  My stomach has been all in knots over the whole thing.  There is so much we have to talk about and only a couple of days to do it in.

She gave up the chance to become a supervisor at her job in order to come down here.  That says a LOT right there.

I know she loves me, but does she love me enough to stay married to me, in spite of the stresses she's facing now?

I'm worried, scared, hopeful, despondent, anxious and stressed out all at once.  I never thought I'd be fighting to save our marriage this soon.  It doesn't help that she's being ambivalent about the whole thing.  I don't know what to think or do.

I hope that whatever I do wind up doing it helps save our marriage, not hurt it.
