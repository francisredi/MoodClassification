Waiting for the other shoe
Today's one of those days where I'm just going to spend the entire day waiting for something bad to happen.  I hate it when I get like this.  I'm doing my best to stay diligent and work hard and not slack off (unlike most days), but I just feel like there's something on the horizon.  Something bad.  Something I haven't done, something I haven't taken care of, something that's gonna jump up and bite me in the ass.  My boss has the feel of a caged lion today, like he's just stalking around and he's peaceful now, but just anything could probably set him off.

It's not his fault, honestly.  The thing that I fear the most, and I know how insane this is, is him asking about something that I haven't taken care of so that I look bad.  That's right, I'm not afraid that he'll fire me.  I'm not afraid that I've irreparably screwed something up.  I'm not afraid of him chucking me out the window or kicking me down the stairs.  I'm afraid of being scolded.  I'm afraid of looking bad.  My head is in constant tension between the perfectionism that I impose on myself and the absolute certainty that I can't pull it off.  That I can't possibly do anything right and that I'll be exposed as a useless fraud.

Jeez.  I'm glad I'm in therapy.  It was worse when I didn't actually know any of this was going on.
