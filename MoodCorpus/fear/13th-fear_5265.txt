Emerald City Comic Con and Seattle Visit
I'm anxious because I'm about to fly out to FL.&nbsp; But, on an up note...I went to Seattle for the Emerald City Comic Con. I got to see some artists I like and got to do some sight seeing. Thanks to Creepy Pippy, I found the Sci Fi Museum. I didn't even know it was there! Robert Tritthardt, creator of Writhe and Shine.&nbsp; Super nice guy!&nbsp; I forgot he now lives in Seattle.&nbsp; I should have expected him at the Con.I went to have my Lenore comics signed by Roman Dirge.&nbsp; You can check out his website, Spooky Land.&nbsp; Also as super nice guy...We went to the Space Needle.&nbsp; It's 520 feet high at the Observation Deck.Damon is afraid of heightsThe view of Seattle is GORGEOUS!You can see the Sci Fi Museum from the Space Needle.&nbsp; It's such a weird building.More Sci Fi MuseumI was only able to get one picture inside.&nbsp; You can't take pictures inside.&nbsp; Ooops.Finally, I saw this on a trash can.&nbsp; Personally, I'm going to keep my DM.&nbsp; I don't need to recycle him.&nbsp; However, there must be an over abundance of them in Seattle.&nbsp; :0)
