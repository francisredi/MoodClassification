waiting
i'm so frustrated. the nurse called and left a message about my results on the m.r.i. 
i returned her call after lunch and got some diagnose with about four words, a word i'm not familiar with. when i asked her to repeat it, she told me that my doctor would discuss it with during my appointment and answer any questions. i asked her if it was a stroke and i was told that it's possible, but it may not be.
come on! they have to some idea of what is going on after having an m.r.i.

what i can deduce from things so far as:
 *a cat scan needed to be followed up by a m.r.i.
 *my head aches on my left cerebrum. 
 *brain injuries are due to an injury, a stroke or a brain tumor.
 *i haven't injured my head for about two or three years and the 
  injury was around by cerebellum/occipital, not the side.
 *i don't have slurry speech.
 *i have problem recalling words in speech and writing.
 *i can understand what people say to me.
 *it could be a stroke, but it also could be something else...

two days is a long time to wait.
