Waiting.
I'm waiting for the watched pot to boil, for the other shoe to drop, for the first roll of thunder when the weather's dead calm as it only is before a storm.  Surely, this kind of tense waiting can't last weeks?  Theoretecally, I know it could be like March 1 before I go into labour.   I know that 40 weeks is only an average, and in most cases short of the mark.  But I honestly, seriously don't think it will be that long.  Things are too ... calm.  I'm way too aware that it could be any second now.  I think it'll drive me nuts if it lasts another 5 days, never mind 10, although I know that if you're to go by stats it well might.  I need to go do *something* to make me forget I'm waiting.  I don't remember it being this bad with Mikie.  I'm not afraid of being pregnant forever.  I'm not really uncomfortable.  I'm not even really impatient.   I'm just ... not good at waiting.

I went into labour at 39W3D with Mikie, if you go by one due date, or right on my due date if you go by another.  I'm 39W3D tomorrow.
