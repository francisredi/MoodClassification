wait, am i updating? o_O!
ah, long time no see, livejournal... i don't really know how to start. so many things have happened lately... i am going to make a lazy entry about some events, that being all (for now)&nbsp;the new semester started with the most sucker&nbsp; schedule ever: mon-wed 11:30 - 14:30, linguistics and scottish and irish literatur, half an hour lunch break, then syntax&nbsp; -__-; tue-thur 8:00 - 10:00 phonetics (YES, you got that right, i have to be there at EIGHT, that means leaving my warm bed at six, gah, they are going to kill me) 15:00 - 16:30 Classical Literature (that is, total boredom with the teacher also knwon as "tu profesor feo" by italian erasmus and cristina, the girl who keeps me awake that hour and a half by dirty means) ... come on, pity me! i want to hear you all say "ooooh poor annaaaaaa life is so mean on heeeer" . well, that is better.&nbsp;i seem to be going to london this easter. that is, i do not believe it yet, nor will i until i get soaked by the terrible weather and eat some fish and chips (stereotype, she wrote). i will be staying there at piccadilly backpackers, a totally bargainistic and most recommended hostel right in piccadilly circus :_) i already have a guide, with useful tips on how not to get robbed everywhere (bars and madame tussaud's included in the category&nbsp; "gente que te tima"). and yes, i am extremely nervous about it...hmmm i am hungry... and tomorrow i have to wake up at six, so i'd better go make me some hamburgers!!
