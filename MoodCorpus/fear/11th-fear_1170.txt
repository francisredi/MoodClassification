boogeymen
I have a bad headache, and I can't find any panadol anywhere. I've turned this house upside-down looking for something... anything... but nothing.My family have gone down to the Beach House again tonight, so I'm home on my own. I rented out a couple of dvds to watch. I shouldn't have rented out the horror movie, but I did - and now after watching it and being on my own alone - I'm scared shitless! Word of advice - never watch a movie about boogeymen when you're on your own at night.Rogu put some money into my account today to pay for the Korn + Disturbed + Hatebreed Concert and also a little extra for me to spend on myself. I haven't been making much money lately (to be honest, I was making more money being a Centrelink bum) so he thought he'd make my day. Once I get off the internet I'm going to call him. The nights are so lonely without him.I worked today. I really enjoy my job. Each day I'm going to make an effort to clean out at least one of my boss's drawers. They're so messy! I'm a bit of a neat freak, and it drives me nuts to work at a cluttered, unorganised desk.I also did all my housework today so tomorrow I can sleep in and not have to worry about getting anything done.Well, I suppose I should go and double check that all the doors are locked... damn that bloody boogeyman movie. I am so not sleeping tonight!
