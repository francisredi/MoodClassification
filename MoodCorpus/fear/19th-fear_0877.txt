Poor Spacedog
It has been a stressful couple of days.  Cole (who should be renamed "Hoover") swallowed an alkaline battery and had to have emergency surgery.  The whole experience was terrifying because he is just a baby, and I didn't realize that when I called the vet to ask about what should happen about the battery that surgery would even be an option.  In my naive mind I thought that they would give him something to induce vomiting.  Anyways, the whole surgery was stressful and scary.  On top of this we had to find $2,000 to pay for the surgery.  My parents are away in Arizona, however during the days that this occurred they were on a side trip to Las Vegas and we did not have a contact number for their place in Vegas.  So I had to phone family and ask for money from a lot of people I never wanted to owe money to. 
I don't know how to react to the whole situation.  Not three days prior I was worried that Mike and I wouldn't make this month's rent because we had no money.  Then an emergency that cost us thousands of dollars comes along.  I'm a bit hysterical I think.
