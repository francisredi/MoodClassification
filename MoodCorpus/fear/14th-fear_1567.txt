English Class
So today was my first day of English class. I was so scared, even though I knew I would be speaking my native language. The day didn't start off so well, which was adding to my "Oh my God, this day is going to suck!" kind of feeling. First, it was raining, second, Susan wasn't feeling well, third, Ray started talking about scary future things that we have no control over right now, and overall I just got very depressed about the entire day. To make matters worse, part of the fabric on my umbrella detached then turned inside out, I really wasn't exactly sure where the JR station was (I was supposed to catch a taxi there), even though Kashiwagi-sensei gave me directions, and I was running late. As I wandered past Kansai Supermarket, I suddenly saw a taxi. I waved it down, and hopped in. Luckily I got to Shoin in time, and Forby-san was outside the building, so I was guided to my room. As I walked in, I noticed that the students looked at me with confused faces. They probably didn't know who I was or what I was doing there. Nervously, I let out a "Konnichiwa" and a few nodded and responded softly. The professor walked in a little later and introduced himself and me as he passed out the syllabus. He then wanted the students to introduce themselves, and I was to ask them a question. I was nervous at first, but it went pretty well. I was pretty surprised at how well they could speak English. After the last girl introduced herself, it was their turn to ask me questions. I got many questions from "Why do you study Japanese?" to "Do you have a boyfriend?" That last question got the girls all excited when I told them I had a fiancee. Yamamoto-sensei told them that they could ask me about him next week since the unit we would be covering discusses relationships. I am very nervous about that. I hope I can teach these girls and not be a total screw up.
