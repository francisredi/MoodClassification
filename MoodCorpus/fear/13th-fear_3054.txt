Teeth
So! On Monday, at 7:45 in the am, I'm going in for dental surgery.

  Getting nine teeth removed; four wisdom teeth (both on the top and bottom), four central incisors (both on the top and bottom), one lateral incisor (on the top). After I recover from that (I'll have plenty of stitches, and lots of pain killers, and a fuckton of bed rest), I'll have a temporary partial denture that I'll use to fill-in for the front teeth until my gums have healed enough to where I can get the last part of my oral surgery; dental implants.

  Dental implants require a strong metal - usually titanium - post to be implanted into my jaw, where a faux crown is then attached. It looks just like a real tooth, the only difference is that it's metal and ceramic (and drilled into my jaw). The thing is, though, that I have to pay for them myself. It's considered cosmetic surgery, so the military won't pay for it. If I were going to get a bridge, they'd pay, but I don't want a bridge. :)

  And yes, I'm saving up for it. Nyah.
