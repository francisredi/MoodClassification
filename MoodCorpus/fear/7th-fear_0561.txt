bushfires
The sky is orange and hazy. There's a major bushfire a couple of towns away at King Lake. As the day has progressed, the smoke has gotten thicker, and I'm beginning to get nervous. I drove into Lilydale a couple of hours ago and the hills that normally surround the town were not at all visible behind all the smoke.&nbsp;It's a 40 degree day today and a total fire ban. I imagine the conditions are terrible for all those firefighters out there who are battling the seemingly invincible fires that are spread out across Victoria. My Mum tells me not to worry, but it's hard not to worry when you live in a rural area surrounded by dry gum-trees and leaf litter. You can usually see the whole Yarra Valley from my Nan's house, but when I went up to check their mail I couldn't see anything. Every range is hidden behind a thick layer of smoke and ash.
It's Australia Day today and what better way to celebrate than stressing out about bushfires in the 40 degree swelter of the day. Humpf.
