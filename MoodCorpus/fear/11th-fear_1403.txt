Hello 
Things have been well, I guess. School, work, wedding, pirate shows, getting drunk on Valentine's Day before Japanese class-yeah that's all that you missed. Currently I have a big decision to make about what university to go to. Thinking about cost and transportation, I was going to transfer to Cal State Long Beach but everyone, including my Japanese teacher, is urging me to go to UCLA. I'm starting to think about it more but if I go to UCLA it will be a huge jump for me and I'm scared. Then again, that is not much of an excuse at all. 

The wedding is currently draining my funds but I seriously need a car. I'm even considering a dreadful loan to get one. It's just getting ridiculous, I really need a car. 

I've been having the same dream for a few nights in a row. It's me and Sakura, just the two us, permanently together. It's kind of a nightmare really because I've realized that can never be; I'll always be the weekend parent. I envy my ex in that his life is centered around family. He's got Sakura, a wife, and a new baby. I kinda feel like No Doubt's song "A Simple Kind of Life". I have a good life, I'm racing towards a better future, but it's a rather selfish life. Sometimes I wonder why God put me in this position. I know I have to make this life work but I feel no matter how high I reach the top I will always be a failure.
