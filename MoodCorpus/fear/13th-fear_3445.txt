Do I have anything to report?  Not really.  Pete is going to be going through some tough times coming up and I wish I could be there to help him through.  Even if I had the money I couldn't do that, though.  April 5th I have another follow-up with my surgeon, one year post surgery.  I expect then we will beging working towards the other surgery/ies I will need.  I am expecting to have to go twice for the skin removal procedures, i really doubt they will do it all in one surgery.  Even possibly a third time.  So starting soon I will be going through a slew of doctor's appointment and pre operative tests and consultations and such.  I know Pete won't be on much in the near future and then soon after I won't be on much.  This is going to be hard, but after everything is done (looking at a few months at least here) we can actually start looking towards the future.  I'm nervous about that, not because I am unsure of what I want, but because I am scared that things won't work out.  I don't mean to say once we meet that there will be nothing there, but that life issues will keep keeping us apart.  I suppose only time will tell
