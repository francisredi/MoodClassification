Nap Time Is Over
So, I have awoken.  I had some pretty bad dreams.  Its funny how my fear of water is so pronounced in my dreams, I actually think that the fear comes from my dreams.  There was one time that I dreamed I drown, and I felt myself drown, it was fairly scary (and I woke up choking, perhaps due to drooling or some other thing).  Anyway, I woke up sweaty. The first dream, I was in Florida, and I was volunteering, and it was off the coast, Justin was walking ahead of me, when I looked around the coast, and noticed that the drop from the beach into the water was straight down, so I became terrified, and Justin would not turn around to help me, and I slid into it.

The next series of dreams were basically the same senario, I was volunteering at some sort of Aquarium.  They had huge tanks which held the sharks, seals, and many tropical fish.  I never actually got in the water, but I remember walking around the tanks with this horrible fear of something terrible happening.

Then I woke up all sweaty.  Nice.

Anyway, my mom is on her way here, i.e. Justin's mom's house.  We are all meeting here to go to a crawfish boil at Nick's parents house, it is supposed to be a going away party of sorts, I am scared of going, me and social events, they just don't work for me. Wish me luck.
