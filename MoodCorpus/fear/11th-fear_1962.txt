A whine
Tomorrow I go back under the knife for hopefully the last time. Now I am usually a glass half full type of woman, but for some reason I can&#8217;t wrap my mind around the &#8220;last time&#8221; part of the equation and have much fear about the pending operation. I have set up a support system of doctors to deal with the aftermath, since each time I have one of these reconstruction things, something goes haywire. I have loved ones supporting me and I can&#8217;t figure out why I am still really obsessing. 

It might be because the end of things is &#8220;the end of things&#8221;; meaning no more leaning on recovery as a crutch for not getting on with my life. There is much in flux right now. My older daughter is searching for something in school that has meaning for her while combating ADD and its attendant executive function issues. My husband is still unemployed and searching for what he wants to do when he grows up (at age 51) and it worries and frustrates me that I can&#8217;t give him some of my &#8220;just go out there and do it&#8221; momentum. And me, well I keep searching too--for something to do with my creative urges that will make money. 

I am getting out more and feeling less reclusive. I went to a fascinating presentation by a cultured pearl wholesaler yesterday. Gorgeous things--black pearls, golden pearls, etc. I&#8217;ve never seen such jewelry in my life. I loved learning about how pearls are made and sold. The fact that some rich lady in Dallas can write a check for $56,000 for a string of cultured pearls is beyond me. It was a fun presentation considering I will never wear such things (and really don&#8217;t like the gaudy, &#8220;I&#8217;m so rich&#8221; type jewelry. I was also amused that some of the women in the room DO buy pearls like that. 

I just can&#8217;t shake the feeling that another shoe will drop and that this is not the end of my recovery. Like I said, I don&#8217;t want it to end and I so do want it to end. I&#8217;m just standing here on the cusp feeling terrified.
