Ok so here's my last update as a mommy of one.  We are having the baby on thursday.  They are inducing me cause I've been in labor(false, it's painful like real labor but not changing my cervix) for 4 weeks, this is causing stress on Mason, and having him in there is putting stress on my kidneys.  So after discussing it with my doc we decided to just get him out for the sake of both of us.  My cervix is being really funky, it's dialated 3-4 at the bottom but 5 up by the baby's head.  I didn't know your cervix could dialate in a funnel like that.  So hopefully the induction goes smooth.  With Brody when I hit a 5 I dialated from 5 to 10 in an hour.  So that's another reason she wants to induce cause Dave works an hour away and I have no car.  I'm so ready to be able to sleep for more than 10-15 minutes at a time.  

Watch for a birth announcement!

Lisa I will call you right when he's born so you can come and visit him if you want!
