The suck
Yesterday half of my tooth decided to fall off  so i had to go to the dentist today. She looked at it for 2 seconds, didn't even let me speak, sticks some weird paste that looks like bubblegum+cement and here i am. The damn thing is coming out, it looks like i fixed my tooth with bubblegum and yeah...are all dentists like this? I have a feeling i have to switch dentist again. I'm going back there on the 20th so i'm hoping i can get this tooth fixed for good...and like, Mrs. Dentist take more than 5 minutes to take care of me i'm paying after all T^T.

On another note i'm super nervous about Friday. I finally decided it's time i take care of something that didn't went well in my surgery, one of the things i placed there dislocated itself to under my rib. Needless to say it's always inflamated, hurts like hell, makes it hard to breathe and i always have to sleep on my right side wich is making my right arm hurt like hell... So yeah i scheduled surgery for friday D:!!!! 

I have to open my very well healed scar again and the doctor is going to move his fingers around my entrails...yay... Well after this i'll have to recover from surgery, since there'll be some stitches in the muscle and those are a pain in the ass to heal. So i won't be around the interweb.

I hope i'll return soon with plenty of drawings.
