stupid stupid me
all right, I have to have THE most screwed up ideas on relationships.  J is being absolutely wonderful, with all the little things, like wrapping his arms around me that sorta thing, and its freakin me out.  I KNOW.  He's being great and it is so weird to me that I don't know what to do.  It actually makes me scared of being with him cuz I'm out of my element...not comfortable.  And it's really hard for me to trust him, because he's being NICE.  honestly.  somebody slap me.  A decent guy comes along and it makes me want to run away.

I need some major girl talk, where are my roomies!?!?!?!

tonight I'll get some time off to go out to dinner and see les Miserables with my dad, which will be wonderful.

I'm soo terrified that I'm going to do/say something stupid and he's going to be like, umm..yeah...i'll call ya (the boy, not my dad).

It has really been a long time since I've met someone new that wasn't a fling.
