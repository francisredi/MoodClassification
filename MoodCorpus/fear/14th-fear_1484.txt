The weirdest thing...
I know it's been a while since I actually made an entry, but I finally have something to write about. And this is just after I was talking to Erica about how I was going to make an entry on Wednesday when I had my birthday. 

 Earlier today (I think it was around noon or so) I had this really sharp pain in my chest that actually made me go "Ow!". But yeah, I thought nothing of it. Then I started getting dizzy, so I made the decision to go to the bathroom in case I had to throw up or something of that sort. 

 Next thing I know, my mom is waking me up, and I'm face first on the floor by my computer area.

 Aside from this being incredibly weird, I'm mostly amazed that I didn't hit my head on either my desk, my printer station, or the table beside me. 

 So my mom got me up off of the floor and I went to my bed, where our friend (who was staying over for the night, and is conveniently a nurse) checked up on me. She thinks it was some sort of indigestion, but the whole sharp pain in my chest thing is kind of freaking me out. I slept for four and a half hours after it happened, and I'm feeling better now, but I'm just worried. Especially since I'm home alone with my sister, and if it happens again, I have to rely on HER to call 911. Yeeesh. 

 Anyway, that's my interesting entry of the day. Tadaa.
