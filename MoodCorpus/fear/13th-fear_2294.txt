Dad is right about to leave until Friday. It makes me want to cry. And there, he's just gone out the door. I'm going to be alone with mum until Friday, and she's such a vile woman sometimes. It makes me want to cry. (In fact I am.)  She randomly snaps and tells me to shut up, and I get really upset. (This has happened to be before when I was little, a friend did it to me and I'm still sort of traumatized) When I try to bring it up, she won't listen to what I have to say. Today at dinner I was telling her something, and I asked her to please look at me when I was talking to her, and she got ANGRY at me and said "my eyes and ears work independently, and I can still hear what you're saying." and I was like "I don't care. You should be looking at me." And it was just bad.

I took my UMD placement tests today and pretty much cheated on them. It was sweet.

This slideshow sucks in that it is such a huge amount of work. It's going to come out awfully, I fear.

I may have some serious trouble lining up a place for me to do my Senior Service, and it's making me really nervous.

In non-gross news, my prom dress came in today! ^_^
