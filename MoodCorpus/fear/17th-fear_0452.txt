Scary dream
Lost has perked up a bit. Last night Michael went off a bit crazily looking for Walt and Kate got herself, Jack, Sawyer and Locke in a spot of bother. Claire's still not speaking to Charlie. I DO like the way Sawyer looks at Kate these days. PHWOARRRR. He is damn hot but I knew that already. Jay gets in from martial arts about a third of the way through the program so I have to give him a quick update. Usually he arrives during ads so that's convenient.

I'm going to have to stop my horror-watching for a while as I had a scary dream last night, and every time it woke me up and I went back to sleep, it just carried on from where it left off. I should have written down the plot but it's mostly gone now. It was really scary at the time though. Maybe I'll have to stick to fluff like Princess Diaries 2 for a while. Only kidding - that's probably what scared me. LOL.

I'd let Ros listen to Pink Martini's Sympathique CD on Monday. By yesterday she's got their Hang On Little Tomato CD from the library and burnt me a copy too. I'll listen to it today at work if I get a chance.

I've still got a very sore throat but the headache and feeling sick have gone, so I'm off to work. Tomorrow I'm going to a session on textual analysis of web-sites - sounds interesting. I'd better head off.
