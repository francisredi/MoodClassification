You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille. . . 
"You bitch! You slut! You whore!" Sorry, Howl at the Moon flashback. 

Hubby is coming home tonight. I've concluded that while I like living alone, I like living with him even better. I have this fear, and it was kind of confirmed this week, that if I ever have to live alone I will become the crazy lady on the block with 14 cats. There were times this week I found myself having entire conversations with KittenSophie. For something that doesn't speak English, she's not a very good listener. 

I'm not having a very good week at work. I got an email from Boss's boss two days ago saying she wanted to have a meeting with me and Boss at 3:30 on Friday. I am technically finished at 4:00, but apparently this is of no regard to Boss's boss. Anyway, as soon as I got that email all I could think of is the scene from Office Space where the Bobs say something to the effect of preferring to do the firing on Fridays. I think this has been said here before, but I don't like my job. It's data entry. I have a college degree and 7 plus years of reserach experience and I'm doing data fucking entry. It would be one thing if I was a) trained, b) had support from my boss, and c) didn't hate my job. My CV is out there, I've had an interview with another department, but nothing is coming from that. Part of me is terrified of being fired but the other part is going "YES! I can go to library school full time if I wasn't working!" But there goes my health insurance. There goes my income. I'd be totally dependent on Hubby and I don't think I can do that. I just can't. I've had two panic attacks already and I can feel another one coming on. Not cool. Not cool at all.

Eeeew, Reeses peanut butter cups with CARAMEL? The food scientists must have had MAJOR PMS when they came up with that one. 

I should probably put clean sheets on the bed. Not cool to sleep on a bare mattress.
