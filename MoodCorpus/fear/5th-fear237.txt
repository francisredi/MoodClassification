Just another Saturday
So tonight I went with Drew to go see the movie Hostel.  I wish I had not seen the movie.  It was the scariest movie I have seen in a long time.  I know this will sound silly, but if you know me it won't, I had not been this scared at the movies since my dad took my brother and I to see Ransom.  I was scared through out most of the movie and even closed my eyes and covered my ears.  I hated the movie.  I better not have nightmares from this movie.  It was gross because the bad guy would cut off peoples fingers.  GROSS!!!!  I will have to look into the scary movies I go to see to make sure they are not too scary.  

Before the movie Drew and I worked out at the gym.  The gym got the best of me.  I had a great workout.  First we went and worked out our back and chest on the weight machine and then we worked abs with the weight ball.  That hurt so bad.  My abs are killing me.  But as they say "no pain, no gain."  Then I worked out on the cross trainer for 25 minutes.  After that I was beat, but refreshed at the same time. 

Nite ~Kim~
