scared..
i now understand why i cant sleep soundly as of late. im spending the weekends here in las pinas to take my mind off my worries. but guess there's just no way of calming me down.

last friday, i f*cked up major in work. and of all the days that i can screw up, why the last day of my training?! why during the one day that id be evaluated and remembered well?! why when it greatly matters?! sobrang malas. 

im scared to sh*t right now. i know i have other options or opportunities out there, but really, its so scary. i just cant think and sleep well. its just so ironic that i have to mess up during the most crucial time of my training. 

its a sign maybe. ive been so confused as of late. i've been contemplating of shifting careers. the past week, ive been thinking of leaving media. to think i just started all over again and was excited last week. thought to myself, maybe because i was starting again and working my way through. but after the big errors i made last friday, guess i dont have anything much to ponder about anymore. 

just hurts my pride though. if i wouldnt be taken in, my ego will deflate big time. another humbling yet depressing experience.
