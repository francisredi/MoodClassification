i feel like a little kid awake on christmas eve. they are so anxious for the next morning that they cant sleep. thats how i am. i tried going to bed around 1:30 and its now 3:47. i lay in bed and think. i think about if i got my apartment. what if i didnt get it? i really like it and its cheap. i will be so upset if i dont get it. my couch can go here and my little corner table will go next to it instead of in my bedroom, where will my bakersrack go? where will i put the kitty litter box, i need to buy alot of little things that i never considered, will my neighbors be nice, wait, i dont even have this apartment for sure... i have been lying in bed with all of that and more running through my head. than i got up and made a list of items that i need to get at walmart and things i need to do. i find out tomorrow if i got the apartment. the guy made it sound like i did but i know better than to get my hopes up. i hope that i did but if not that i will continue to look. if i do however get it, i will be all moved in by feb 11. that is my goal. everything. not just my couches and bed but everything. but its so cute. well the living room is. it has a two tones wall which gives it a really nice look, with a big window over looking the street. it has hardwood floors and is just really cute. the bedroom is dull and has soft but kinda ugly blue carpet. i can get over that. the kitchen is small but i could care less and my kitchen table will look perfect in the little dining area. i dont know. i just hope that iget it. im really nervous. maybe this will have helped to clear my mind and i can sleep.
