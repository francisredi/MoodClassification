Can't you see that I am not afraid...
No, not afraid.  Just supremely nervous.

My doctor's appointment is in 3 1/2 hours, and I'm a little....tense.  I guess that's because I have a lot of mixed emotions about this whole thing.

I think that the biggest thing that I'm dealing with is the fact that finally, FINALLY I have someone who agrees that there's something wrong with me.  For years, I've had doctors, relatives, and even that one evil roommate I had tell me that I was making a big deal out of  nothing, and it was all in my mind.  And I did what I was told.  I drank metamucil.  I took fiber capsules.  I eat a high-fiber diet.  And when that didn't work, there were all the stupid blood tests that they made me do.  Nonetheless, today has been a long time coming, and I just hope that he gives me my prescription and we all move along and are happy.

Obviously, my other concern is that there's something bad wrong with me, aside from the IBS.  I know the chances of that are small, but after all I've been through, it's still a nagging worry in the back of my mind.  

Wish me luck!
