icky stuff
Okay, so. I finally did it. I finally took myself down to the Rape Recovery Center, in Salt Lake, and had an actual therapy appointment, where I actually talked about stuff (the rape and the abuse).

Cried, and I absolutely hate crying in front of people.
Talked about stuff I haven't talked to anyone about before. 
Learned that the nightmares, and the flashbacks, and the intrusive thoughts are "normal", and "healthy", and that are my minds way of dealing with it, and integrating it into my mind. 

It was really hard just sitting in that chair, telling a person I've known for 20 minutes the most horrible stuff about myself. I've gotten used to talking to people about my cutting, and the anxiety, and the depression, and my eating problems, and the ptsd. But talking about the actual events is still so hard for me. It's so hard to make myself say the actual words. My mind locks up, and it stops giving me the words for the names of things, or how to actually describe any of it.
I can see it all so clearly in my head, but when I try to use my mouth, I can't get any of it out. But, I talked about a lot of things. I picked at my hands while I did it though, so they're all sore now.
She says that my biggest problem (and I tend to agree with this), is how much I blame myself for what happened, and that I'm still trying to find a way to "punish" myself for freezing, and not stopping it. When, in reality, freezing up and not fighting back probably saved my life. Though, oftentimes this makes me wish he had just killed me. Would have been a lot kinder on his part. I also hadn't realized how paranoid I am about him finding out that I've told. That he's going to magically know, and come after me. And I'm still scared of that, even though I "know" it couldn't possibly happen.

It was a hard day, I suppose. 
Cried more than I would have liked.
