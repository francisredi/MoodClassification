Too Heavy for a Monday Morning
We had our Monday meeting as usual today and they discussed the problems they are having hiring a new Plumbing Designer and my boss turns to me and asks me if I'm willing to go to night school if they pay for it. They have joked around this ever since last Fall but now they're serious. I told them I was, in fact, interested and have looked up the necessary school information, etc. Now I'm having a mini nervous breakdown. This is a fabulous opportunity, if I can do it. The evening program will take four years (two classes per semester) and I have to take Calculus, and Physics, and lots of other classes that are the FARTHEST end of the spectrum from Literature and Philosophy. So, I'm scared. I'm smart but I've never had any math confidence. My father has a math/science/economics masters, my brother is a physics whiz. They'll help me with my homework here at the office but I'm still nervous. It's a huge time commitment but free school, a skill, and a hefty raise is really appealing. But that means I'll be here for a while. A long while - 10-15 years minimum while. Although I'll actually be able to afford it. And I'll be the only woman Plumbing Designer in South Carolina which is a little daunting. And I need to decide soon. There's a beginner AutoCAD class I can take starting week after next.My weekend was pretty good, got a lot of things done, spent too much money, etc. I'm all frazzled and I have cramps. Help!!
