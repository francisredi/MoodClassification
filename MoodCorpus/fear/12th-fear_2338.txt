scary
Kirk was in an accident last night.  The driver who caused it had been drinking, but was just a hair under the legal blood alcohol limit.  From what I can piece together from Kirk's scrambled recollection and the police report, she pulled out from a side street and struck Kirk on the driver's side, knocking his vehicle into a third one.  Kirk was the only one hurt.

This happened after he dropped me at work (subbing an evening shift, 8:00pm to midnight).  He called me from the hospital.  He wasn't completley coherant and the phone kept cutting out.  Scariness.  :(  I wasn't able to leave work due to a complicated set of circumstances (I could have, but it would have caused problems) but fortunately on my second try I got hold of Kirk's mom and dad, and they were able to go to the ER to be with him.

X-rays showed nothing broken.  His neck is sore of course, and his knees smacked into the steering column, and are badly bruised.  He has some cuts from broken glass.  But otherwise he is okay, thank gods.

I guess my van is totalled.  :(  I haven't seen it yet... in a few minutes I'm going to call the towing company and find out where it is.  I have to get our stuff out of the van, take pictures of it, tape plastic over the broken windows, make arrangements to have it towed somewhere.  And call the insurance agent, and deliver the police report to them.  And somehow run all my other errands.  I hope I can borrow a car so I don't have to do all this by bus.  The insurance agent in particular is a long, unpleasant walk from the nearest bus stop, through an industrial park.
