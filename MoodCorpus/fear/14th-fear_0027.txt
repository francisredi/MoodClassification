So Im sitting here
Feeling slightly accomplished.

Ive done my third VC report in a row and on time (Ive only been VC for three months)

Onto panicking.
The date who is still remaining nameless... :P didnt pick up the phone when I called her for final arrangements and location of her abode which resulted in a large and significant drop in Self esteem on my part and panic. However as I writing this I seem to remember that she may be busy with other things tonight. And yeah scared as hell or nervous or something.  Scared its a real date even more scared it might not be and stuff...

The other thing is that today I discovered that Im so not over MDB it just took someone mentioning the con that she was at and ... well it wasnt pretty.

Claire are you still up for tomorrow and please dont say anything to craig (he's going to join us after his work) about said date. I dont feel like taking his shit on this at the moment, especially after I think is what is going to be a very interesting (read draining and brutal) psyche session.
