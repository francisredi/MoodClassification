So Kat and Olivia came over today, and we were all just kindof hanging around in my room. My cell phone started ringing, and it was a friend I hadn't talked to in a really long time. I was actually suprised, too. It was a nice conversation, except for the fact I was incredibly distracted by Kat trying to make one of my scarves into a turban for one of my stuffed animals. As I was talking to him I figured I probably sounded really immature laughing at Kat and Olivia while trying to talk. Not that I had much insight anyway... I used to have deep conversations with this kid. Now I'm just sitting there giggling at what was going on in the room and talking about things he could've cared less about, seeing as he was going back to school in Boston after a few weeks break. And I'm just now realizing how I've changed. I've become less mature and more careless than I was last year. I used to think a lot more deeply and always had a strong opinion to voice. I never wanted to accept what I thought was wrong, and I used to always know what to do and have a strong sense of what I thought was right. But these days I am just kindof a wreck and not thinking about whats important. I feel brainless, really. I want to change it... and I don't know how. It's up to me and only me to change it. I'm gunna find a way. I'm gunna be above this soon.

Not to mention I'm freaking nervous as hell right now, but I'm nervous for a reason other than what I have written above this statement.
