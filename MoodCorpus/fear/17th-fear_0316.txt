Well, rehearsal went great . . . all through the first act, then the second, then the third, and then most of the way through the fourth! All our dances were great, I dare say perfect, Krieger was a little fast but not too bad. Mack the Knife was AWESOME, everyone cheered like crazy. And Rich Girl went over well too, everyone loved it. Had fun with all the pirates and fishies, hauled Destiny around for a long time. Tori was there, and Sara, Jamie and Hali of course. Kari did great in the ballet dance, everyone did, it looked awesome. Then came my pointe solo, which started out near perfect, Mike was there and all. Then I took my bourre turn into the echappe-retire combination too fast with too little rosin, and guess what I did? I hurt my ankle. After doing so well the last couple months, I pulled something or twisted it and that was that. I even stopped dancing, and anyone who knows me knows what that means. I did start the dance again from the top, and went all the way through, it kinda sucked but at least I did it. I only had one scene after that but by then JoAnn and Tori already had me icing my ankle and Kim just stepped in for me. I really scared everyone. Kim says I don't have to dance in the Tech Rehearsal tomorrow, and then we'll see.
