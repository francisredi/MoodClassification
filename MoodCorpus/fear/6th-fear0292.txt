Dear God,

Why is it that every time I find something I like, I somehow can't keep up with my life? Why am I always so distracted by the things I want to do that I can't find the time to do the things I have to do? Why are my priorities so screwed up? God, even the other people who are like me are better coordinated than I am! HOW THE HELL?!?!

I need to change - to realign what my priorities are. I don't know how it will happen, but I know it needs to. Three friggin' college applications due at the end of this month, a term paper a week overdue - and lengthening, midterm exams looming in the next week, a near impossible play with a dozen someodd lines to memorize, a cold robbing me of my voice, and then to top it all off, all the things I'm doing for you. Hell, God, I even skipped a Worship practice this week just for the sake of this. It wasn't even for my term paper.

It hurts, knowing that I'm not where You want me. But then, I've even asked You where You want me to be, and You're not talking. Am I just supposed to assume that all the cards are lined up just as they should be even when my life is so screwed up as it is? And yet, You ask me to give it all up for a day and just seek You. How is that so hard for me? Why the hell can't I just take a day, give it to You, and be done with it all? Just one day?

God, I'm not asking for anything too major, but can't You just help me out a little? I don't care about my social life any more, God. For all I care, the rest of Millbury High School can go on ignoring me all they want, and I could care less. Has my life of affluence been so greatly twisted that I can't even pull myself away from something so simple as a little anime and some roleplaying? Seriously, how pathetic am I?

Let's just face it.

I'm addicted.
