*wheeze*
I ran out of asthma medicine yesterday and can't get anymore until Tuesday.  My dad sent it with FedEx and they won't leave it at my place; I have to be there to sign for it.  So I'm just gonna pick it up in a few days.  Unfortunately that means that I might have some trouble until then.  See, I haven't run out of this stuff since '03 when I had my last attacks.  And those attacks were life-threatening.  

I had the attacks when I was asleep.  I would wake up not being able to breathe.  On one attack I sat on the edge of the bed trying to calm down, but I keeled over and landed head-first on a solid metal tape-deck.  I broke the thing open with my head.  Then I started convulsing on the floor, throwing up all over the place (including in the tape-deck).  I was lucid the whole time, so I had plenty of time to think if this was gonna be it.  Fortunately it wasn't, and I got my breathing back slowly.  But of course I was freaked out.

And now I'm out of medicine.  I have inhalers in case of emergency but of course I'm nervous as hell, and afraid to sleep.  We'll see how I do in the next couple of days.  The thing is, I told my pop that I was running out about a month ago, and when he finally did send the medicine he fucked up and sent it with a shitty service for this sort of thing.  So my current problems are his fault.  I'm not gonna talk to him for a few days because I'll cuss him up one side and down the other if I do.  Stupid asshole.

I threw that tape-deck away, by the way.  It was busted open and had puke in it.
