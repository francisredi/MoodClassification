I'm never driving in snow ever again!!!!...........ever!
Man so it was snowing pretty hard yesterday and well i was taking Rachel home because we had an away and it was like 11:00 p.m. I hit a curb once but I didnt go up on it I just skidded aside it and then when I was on Stephenson Street I lost control of my car and went up on the curb into someones yard. Plus I alomost hit the car that was in their driveway. I was freeking out. i was so scared because everything happened on the passenegers side where Rachel was. Rachel I'm SOOOOOOOO SORRY SORRY SORRY!!!!!!!!!!! Thank you Reggie for coming and getting Rachel then following me home! Thank you so much I really appreciated it!! Man that was a scary night. I got a flat tire and my rim is bent pretty bad but thats it. I guess I'm pretty lucky that my axle didnt get bent because that wouldve been a bitch to get fixed!!! So I'm not driving in snow ever again. I hate it!!!!!!
