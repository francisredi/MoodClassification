Silent HIll never really goes away, no matter how long it's been since you played it.

Actually, I've been thinking about replaying the entire series lately, but unsure if I was up for the horrifying challenge.  Just now, I took the dog out.  It's just dead quiet out there, especially for a Friday night.  Cold as can be.  Very little moonlight, so it's particularly dark.  I'm standing there shivering, waiting for the dog to finally finish peeing.. and I hear it.

Jesus effing christ that's not a comforting noise.  It was coming from the direction of the parking garage.  Sure as hell didn't sound like any car-related noise I've ever heard.  It sounded way more like we were about to shift in to the alternate universe, skinless children were going to gnaw at my knees, and the walls and ground were about to turn into bloody, rusty metal grating.  Thank god it's not foggy tonight.
