Still plugging along
I'm still having contractions.  They calmed down around 9:30 or so last night.  They got kicking again just after 11pm.  I was up most of the night with contractions, but was too tired to really keep track of anything.  So far today I've had a few, but nothing consistent enough to be considered "getting there".  I do feel like I'm getting a cold again, but I think that could just be the fatigue.  My back is killing me and I've got more discharge than is really necessary.  I hope this pre-labor stuff doesn't drag out too long.  I'm having fits of real anxiousness. I feel like I just need to go do something.  Last night it was a walk today it was hanging a shelf.  I want to go to Home Depot and buy the rest of the shelves I want, but I'm nervous to leave the house.    I shouldn't be nervous, I've still have about 2 weeks left, but Home Depot isn't the place I want to have my water break or anything.  I may go after lunch if I can nap with Connor and get some more energy.  For now laundry will have to satisfy the anxious feelings.
