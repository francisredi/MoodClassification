presentation
I have a presentation in the next 30 minutes and I am starting to get a little nervous. I know the material; I'm just worried about the time restrictions. I hope I don't go under the time limit unknowingly, but I am also scared that I'll take too long...
I only have 6 to 8 minutes to talk about the development within the teenage brain. I know that 6 minutes should be easy to reach, but when the pressure is on everything looks a little harder then it really is. 
I hope I don't cry, again. My group thinks I'm smart and strong, would it surprise them to know that there is a real possibility that I might fall apart? They seemed nervous the last time I saw them. One of my group members have been contacting me regularly with questions and asking my opinion. I don't think she knows how nervous I feel. Well, she'll know I'm nervous when I get to class. I don't hide angst well, but yet I did well as an actress. To quote some one dear to me, "acting comes natural to you because of your eyes. You have very expressive eyes." Sounds really corny, but I think about anything right now. 
Some crackers would be nice right now. They would go great with the long pull on the Mylanta that I'm craving.
