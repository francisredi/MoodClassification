*...shakes, stops, shakes, stop...*
ever since this morning i keep shaking on and off. i've never experienced anything like it, and i'm still scared. people were laughing at me after homeroom because i'd be on and off shaking. every day my friend and i walk after second period from the third floor to the second floor, then talk before going to homeroom. i didn't notice anything wrong with her this morning, but when we were about to part, i saw her falling. at first i thought she lost her balance but then she fell to the floor and started having a seizer. luckily there was a teacher right there to help me, but it was scary. her eyes were starring in outerspace. i stayed with her until the parametics came. after she finished shaking, she was breathing hard and unconscious. her eyelids fell down and you could barely see her eyes going crazy under them. one of the teachers told me to go to class, so i was getting my bag as she came back to earth. i heard the parametics ask her her name and her say the correct thing. she looked all confused. she was sent to the hospital with her younger sister by her side, but i can't get the image out of my head. i've never seen anything like that... especially from my friend. 

well, i'm going to take a shower and work on my homework... all i can think about is if she is surely okay and what caused the seizer.
