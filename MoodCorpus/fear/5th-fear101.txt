A Bit Like Terror
Tonight, I finished my final exams for my work. Tonight, I no longer have a job. This scares me terribly, more than ever before.

Tomorrow, I start student teaching. Today, I was supposed to be fingerprinted so I could, but I forgot completely. Between Caspian's health issues and my administering finals and my voluntarily losing my job, for some reason, I forgot my appointment to be fingerprinted. Now I can't go in for student teaching until I get that done, whenever that is. And my biggest thought is that I'm going to miss some important information because I won't be there in the morning.

I feel like I just jumped off a cliff with an untested parachute, and I don't know if it'll open. I don't know what I'm doing, or when I'm doing it, or anything else, and the uncertainty of my entire life makes me feel awful.

I wondered if I'd get teary-eyed about leaving the college (at least for now), and that wasn't the case, but instead, I've gotten scared.

I still have assignments to do tonight for the student teaching, and I'm not sure how far I'll get on them, but I don't have much choice now, do I?

I'll be fine, I'm sure, but it doesn't feel that way right now.
