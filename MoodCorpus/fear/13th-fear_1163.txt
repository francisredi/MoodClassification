I looked up from the monotony of books long enough to realize that the end of the semester is soon approaching...6 weeks! (or so). Where did all the time go? What have I been doing anyway?? 

Lately, it seems like everyone is getting engaged.  Leah tells me that it wasn't like that when she went to His House - and I kind of wish it was that way right now.  There is something about engagements - maybe because they are so exclusive - but they have a way of bringing all these mixed emotions you never knew were there. Its this weird mixture of being excited for this new burgeoning relationship that you rub shoulders with; and feeling kinda - oh hell, i'll just say it - lonely.  All this fear and doubt rushes my mind when I hear the "M" word (marriage) or the "E" word (engagement). Who is the right person? How do you know? What happens if you make a mistake?? Oh my dear Lord, what if I make a mistake?? This is the one time where erasers on pencils don't do you any good. (The Catholics have tried with "annulments", but thats hardly biblical). I don't want to be unhappy forever...I want to raise kids in a good environment...how do you know that the person you pick (or happen to end up with) is God's will for your life? There is too much ambiguity in this. And if dont' choose wisely, you WILL end up lonely and isolated.  

**I really am happy for the engaged out there - really** 

I guess the only thing left is to have faith that somehow, through all our choice, He'll take care of us.  Sometimes, its hard to cling to promises like Jeremiah 29:11...real hard.
