Introspection
This divorce is kicking my ass!  My heart is broken and my ass size has increased and I have to fight to keep from wallowing.  I spend a lot of time alone, thinking that I'm just sooo unpalatable that not only did my husband flee, leaving a wake of destruction in his absence, but perhaps others would be as displeased. 

I'm afraid that even my stepkids will see how gross I am and flee like their father did.  It's hard.. very hard and yet I'm trying my best to keep my fear at bay.  I spend time with my crochet friends and my rat friends all the while hoping they don't see how yucki I am too.  Sometimes I get my confidence back and I feel like I real person. I forget to feel subconcious and enjoy talking with new people.  I wish I could feel like this all the time!

I'm going to a rattie meetup this weekend and I'm scared that I'm going repel people and have them wish I'd never showed up.
