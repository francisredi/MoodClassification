my best friend is sick
We found out last April mom had cancer. When they found it her count was 157. After treatment it dropped way down to 3.5 (0-3 is normal cancer-free people). She went off her chemo in Nov. for Thanksgiving and she just now started it back about 1 month ago. She got a test back on Monday saying her count is now 300. She had a petscan (finds cancer "hotspots") on Tuesday and now her count is 500 and the cancer speckles have spread all over her abdomen wall. It hasn't spread to any major organs, but it spread on her abdomen. Its good, and really bad all at the same time. My dad isn't telling my sister and I the "minor details" because he doesn't want us worrying. I guess him worrying on his own is enough. What is it he isn't telling us. I, being the typical girl, assume its something like "there isn't really anything more we can do medically speaking". Hopefully this isn't the case. Mom is going to start a new chemo that is still in the testing stages. The doctor that came up with this new drug is actually going to be overseeing her case. The fact that we've resulted to a drug that isn't fullproof yet makes me think things are pretty bad. I'm so scared.

I haven't been home since the semester started because I've had concerts/music related things every weekend. I can't get those two months with my mom back which may be one of my biggest regrets to date. I can't lose her. 

Please pray for my family.
