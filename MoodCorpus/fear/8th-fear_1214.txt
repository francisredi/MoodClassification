am I 
now just gonna start writing in here frantically everytime panic takes over?  
I guess for now that is the way it is gonna be.  Geez, what am I gonna do?  I feel like right now air is getting thin for me.   My thoughts are racing and all because I mso afraid to loose my significant other.  And what is even worse is that I am fully aware that my panic does not make things any better.  I just don't want to loose him, and after the last phone conversations things have been rough.  Our argument about when to see each other again was stupid, on my side as well as on his side.  And I don't want that to stand between us anymore.  I promised him that I am gonna wait for him until he is done with school, and that is exactly what I am gonna do.  Why?  because he means that much to me.  But I can only hope and pray that he feels the same.  Geez, we have made it this far.  I dont want to give up now.  And I pray that neither does he.
