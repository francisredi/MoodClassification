So scared!
Tonight I was scared out of my mind!  My little doggie Bruce fell in the pool and couldnt get out.  I dont know how long he was in there but when I saw him I freaked out.  He was in shock and wouldnt come to the edge so I had to jump in the pool and grab him.  I was so scared I couldnt even feel the cold water until I got up stairs to give him a warm bath.  The poor thing was so scared he wouldnt stop shaking.  I gave him a warm lavender scented bubble bath with aroma therapy candles (it soothes him) and painted his nails his favorite shade of pink (he walks with a greater since of pride when they are painted).  And after all that I realized that I treat my dog better than I treat a)most people and b)myself.  I think the reason I pamper him so much is because I know that he will love me unconditionally. Knowing this I think I work harder so I deserve his love instead just getting it.  Wow, now I realize I talk about my dog like he a person.
