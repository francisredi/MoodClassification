the fire in our throats will beckon the thaw.
i'm going to go back to working at vans.
i miss my second family; i miss goofing off and being paid to do so; i miss the seemingly-endless and stressful nights of closing down the ole' store; i miss being paid little to nothing and wasting a gallon of gas to go to and from work each day; i miss when we can't take any more of anything and pointing out who we are going to kill next if and when they walk into the store; i miss finding any means necessary to entertain ourselves when the circulation is at a dead halt, whether it be with bouncy balls or drawing pictures or customizing our own shoes online or playing the game where you the flying geoff rowley shoes on the internet; i miss calling dibs on which employee gets to deal with which customer and which employee gets to sit in the back room on their ass, continuously whining about how intently they want to simply go home and end their shift for the day; i miss discussing and planning how we are all going down as one--all for one and one for all.
i just miss it all, i even miss being as busy as i was--it gave me less time to think.

oh, and i wrote a really long, extensive letter.
i am extremely nervous about it, but it is all for the better.
all i need to do is proof read it and re-write it then turn it over to the intended receiver.
