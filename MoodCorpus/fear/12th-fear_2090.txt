Eeek
Today is Thursday.  Last night Neal, me, Alison and her friend went to Clarke's for dinner.  It was good cause I was starving and it was nice to get outside for a walk.  When we came back it was raining out.  I have no idea why taking a cab didn't cross my mind, but I continued to walk home, which is about 8 blocks.  It started raining harder and there was thunder and lightening and it was kinda scary cause the rest of them went to Alison's so I had to walk part of the way by myself.  I don't mind walking by myself, but the lightening and thunder was scary.  By the time I got home I was so so freaking wet.  So that was interesting. 

I got a call from Adam - this guy at Real Time Freight, which is a company I interviewed for on Monday.  He wants to follow up.  So, I'll call him back at 1-ish.  I don't know why I'm so nervous.  I really liked the people there and it would be an awesome working environment.  I think that it's because of that that I'm nervous.  OK, I can't think about it. 

I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow morning, which means I have to go home again.  Dammit.  I didn't go home on tuesday because Matt let me borrow his car, which I REALLY appreciated.  But I feel really bad asking him again.  I could go home tonight and sleep there because my appt. is at 9 am.  But I would be alone with Diana.  So, I don't know what to do.  I'll figure something out.  
Ok, now I'm going to have some waffles.
