This is going to be my last entry for a while. I am moving, so that is going to leave me a little incommunicado for the next couple of weeks.

My birthday was on Sunday, and I had a nice quasi-intimate dinner with friends and a little bit of dancing, and that was about it. I'm now 30 years old. Officially a "grown up." And I still don't feel it. I only feel moderate more mature than I was when I was 21. While many aspects of adulthood have hit me hard and sunk in, the illusion of "maturity" still is rather nebulous.

To top off this philosophical mood I've been in, the prospect of moving yet again both hurts and scares me. I need to strike out on my own, but it's one more nail of failure for my own coffin for me. The idea of finally accepting that Autumn never is going to "smarten up" or "wake up" to having left me, that the idea of childishly holding onto the vainglorious prospect of things reverting back to the way they were is precisely that: childish. And as I pore through the detritus of that fated union in what was supposed to be OUR house, I can't help but wonder if much of the pain I feel is from being hurt by her separation, or from old wounds being reopened, or just from my own damned self hurting myself deliberately. I've always hated moving, anyway. I spend so long emotionally conditioning myself to a particular environment, only to be uprooted violently, like a seedling pulled rudely by a snot-nosed child.

But here's hoping that I can avoid making any more emotional missteps, because I think I've made too many of them for one lifetime and I'm tired of always fucking up.
