Feeling a little down
Lately I've been feeling really down- well it alternates from me feeling on top of the word to being ehhh to the extreme.  I stopped running a few weeks ago and I'm sad about that.  I was doing so well but then Eboni's schedule changed.  She works the nights I'm free and the nights she free is usually when I'm busy with comedy shows.  I gained all the weight I lost back.  My pants are no longer loose and I'm sure a few pairs don't even fit me anymore.  I feel like I'm eating a lot more now too, I think it's mostly because I'm depressed.  I can't get over me bombing on stage Saturday.  I know it happens to everyone and I should be lucky it wasn't at an actual show, but I keep thinking "what if that happens on March 14?"  I sound overly rehearsed and thats killing me!

Anyways I'm trying to figure out where to take my next comedy class.  I want to take it at the ice house but the next session start March something and thats to soon for me, so I'm hoping they'll have a summer session.  I'm just afraid I won't be motivated to write a new set because the people in the class wouldn't have heard it.  I really want to take improv classes but I'm scared to death of it!  I know I'm gonna suck so I don't even think I should bother with it.  With a thing like Improv I know I would need someone I know  in the class with me to feel comfortable.  Another problem is all the improv classes I find are to far for me to get to.  I'm thinking maybe I could do metro to them but yuck I don't want to do that.  I feel like such a loser for not knowing how to drive.  

Ughh I Don't Like How I've Been Feeling!
