"History Of Virtuosity"
Sometimes my hope is balanced on the tip of a needle. (Twitch -- and it falls.

Plop!)

Today no one could say the right thing. Almost like it was a law: you are not allowed to say something that will make Rachel feel good about life.
(I lie. Tyler's Euro presentation made my day better.)

I feel very bipolar about the Spring deal.
Sometimes I feel like I'm going with a group of strangers, and that even if I went with a completely different group, completely different people, they would still  be strangers.
(But then, do you ever know anyone? So that you could predict their every word?)

And then, the next moment, I can't wait to go. As if the night is full of more promise than weeks and weeks of normal time.
(It's only a dance, I know. And yet sometimes the needle is thinner because otherwise it wouldn't work, right?)

I don't touch people anymore.
I need someone to make me comfortable with touch. None of these tackle-me-hug-me things; it's horrible but they scare me, now. Just, hold my hand. Touch my shoulder.

Why am I so afraid of everyone?
They can hurt me. Oh wait, I'm afraid of what might happen thousands of years before anything actually does.
