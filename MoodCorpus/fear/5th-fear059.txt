Oh God I am scared!
I woke up half an hour before my alarm went off and I couldn't get back to sleep so I thought I would come and write a quick post as promised. We have to leave for the hospital in an hour and I still have to shower and get some of my things together so I can't make this long. I don't know what to say other than I am scared and if you pray, please say a prayer for me today. I know I shouldn't be so scared, it's just minor surgery after all, but I am afraid of what they will/won't find. And I always react badly to anthetsia (or however you spell it) and the strong pain killers they give me, they tend to make me sick. Okay, I have to go shower now. If anyone wants to know how I am doing later and either my mom, Vernon, or if I am up to it, myself will answer it and give you an update. I can't believe it's here. I remember it being so far away... I can't believe it's the 9th already. Okay, must go shower. Bye.
