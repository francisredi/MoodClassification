SCARIEST DREAM EVER!
ELENA you are warned you might not want to read this...
so last night i had this nightmare...
Elena and i are at a park talking while Collin and Ava play, this man pulls up and then he grabs AVA AND COLLIN! puts them in his trunk and drives off! Elena is screaming hysterically and I'm chasing the car i was so close i could almost touch it, i could hear the kids screaming for us. The man threw a badge at us out the window and just laughed. He was apparently an FBI agent! We ran to elena's crying to jae trying to explain what had happened, we went to the police who refused to help us. Elena and i went searching for this man in the middle of the night in the pouring rain. We were soaked and freezing and crying but determined to find them. We started walking into this building and Elena looked at me and it was so cold i could see her breath when she spoke and she said " Felicia what if he...what if he's killed our babies I'LL KILL THE BASTARD!" So we went off running in the dark into this building...then dogs started barking outside my window and i woke up SCARIEST DREAM i have ever had in my life and never want to have it or anything similar to it again!
ahhh
