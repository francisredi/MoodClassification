I Need Good Luck  :)  
Hey LJ =)
 Hows it goin?  I'm in kinda a weird mood. I'm so scared, nervous, and in-patient all at the same time. If you remember the letter i wrote for dad's court a while back to see if i cud get to see him, well that didnt work this time, but thanks to dad complaining to shitty ass judge, WE GET ANOTHER CHANCE :) I gotta bring my copy with me adn prove that i wrote it..and we might have a chance babbyy :)  I', excited to see what well happen, but on the other hand, Im a bit nervous because i dont know what they well ask, or  what there final decision might be. ITS NEVE WRECKING. But i have to do it for dad and me, I just have too..there's no turning back now. Court is tomorrow at 10:00 a.m, which means i gets to get outta school..he he he.. !   A while ago i called dad to see how he was, and kool ol' Justin my cousin was there..lol.he is such a laugh..he calls me shit legs ha ha..same as dad..but dad rearly lets him get away with it  ! BA! I only met him recently, but he is a real nice guy..JAIMEE LOVES HIM. ah ha jai. If im allowed to see dad tomorow me dad adn justin are going to move angela's stuff into her house, which is rite next to dad's :)  But the sad news is, even tho its her house, she has to key and all, but the wefare are threating her saying that she cant live alone, even when she had lots of test and stuff done by doctors saying shes capabley fit and normal to be a mother. They even had Nathan examined, and he is 100% taken care of...so whats the problem ?  I dont know !  tehy suck but ! :@ ERGG! 
   We'll, im gonna go get rested up for tomorow, who ever reads this, PRAY THAT I WELL BE ALLOWED TO SEE MY DADDDY :)            Rebecca -x0x
