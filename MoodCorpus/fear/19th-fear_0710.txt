this mourning i woke up and turned my cell on, because johnny told me to call him in the mourning. he works nights, re-doing a wendy's. so i turned my phone off, i get a text. around 3:30 last night, he sent me a text saying "fyi ur my girl now if thats cool with u! lemme know."

at first i'm like huh, then i smile .. then all the sudden this huge rush of fear falls on me. i text him back and said "yes, it's cool!" why am i all the sudden scared?



ok, i don't have to ask him to come see me, he automatically asks if he can come over. today he said he was going to come pick me up from work. he's forever kissing me, wrapping his arms around me and just holding me. always looking at me, like if i'm falling a sleep and i open my eyes .. he's looking at me. i say what, he says nothing i like looking at you. i ask why, he says cause your cute. he's spoiling me and i'm scared out of my fucking mind.

but i really do like him a lot, but i'm also keeping my walls up so that i don't get myself burned. but i seriously actually feel like he won't burn me.
