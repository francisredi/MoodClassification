heart ache/ heart pain in the ass
had to go to the hospital for the usual reasons, 
while i am in the ER they take my stats - well my heart rate is through the roof.  first they think it is an accedent, or problem with the equipment... well its not.
they hook me us to moniters and an EKG machine, my heart rate is 187 (yeah well my normal resting heart rate i know to be under 80 BPM) so this is not good.  they IV me, take blood for imediate tests, and get out this huge ass needle to go into my heart if they can't bring my rate down.  they ask me a ton of fuckin questions - no, never had heart problems, usualy i am better than average, no i dunno why... i mean i didn't even come in for heart trubble how was i supposted to know if it had happened before - i didn't know it was happening now!
and funny all those machines, needles and tests, they didn't relax me any = so the heart rate stayed the same.
anyway with constant supervision by the head doctor, residents and a load of nurses they brought it down. two leters of saline solution directly to the blood flow, forced in under 45 minutes (they had a pressure cuff on the bad of fluids) they brought me down to 150 - then the huge needle went away - then 130 and at 115 (6:30 am) i was cleared to enter the ward i went to hospital to be admited to.  crazy.
no reason why. blood tests normal, EKG was fine, all ok - they dunno.  and aparently don't care too much either.  next day i monitered all the time, but that was all... if it happens again i have to go to the ER - but i wouldn't know, i didn't know the first time... crazy - can't wait to see the bill for that one.
