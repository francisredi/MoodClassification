Vic Update
So, Vic is home from the hospital.  Not at her home, but at her Mum's for a few days.  

I got a short email from her this morning saying that she had a really bad night and was physically sick a lot.  I got another one from her an hour or two ago from her Mum's house.  She said she's there, but is still quite sick and needs to sleep.

And cos I'm a worrier, I emailed mer Mum to ask how my girl is.  lol

She said that the pain and swelling from the surgery itself seems much less than the previous procedure, but that Vic had stressed herself out in the hospital when the nurses said she might not be able to leave, and then between that and the ride home, she's still really nauseous and sick.  :(

My poor sweet girl.  :(

I feel so helpless being so far away.  I wish I was there to look after her.

And THIS is why I don't wanna go to Vegas on Saturday.  I've already been apart from her enough.  She's gonna come home and I'm gonna be leaving for 5 days.  *big big sigh*

Timing sucks.  :(
