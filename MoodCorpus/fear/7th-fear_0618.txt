muddle and confusion 
I haven't had to think so hard about anything in my life. The decision to leave while so good, could be this giant fall. So many what ifs. Loving someone while rewarding often causes a lot of stress and confusion. Not really knowing that person and fully believing they are everything you want them to be makes the decision even harder. I know I can never have the perfect person I want, but there are certain things I'm not sure Fred could fulfill and his craziness and carefree attitude is part of what I love, but I don't know if he really sees me as a wife or just a partner in crime. Maybe everyone is right, what if marrying him and moving is the worst thing, but what if this is just what I've been waiting for. Then again what if I've gotten outta jail one too many times and this is gonna be my big fuck up. I really don't know I wish this choice was as easy as I first thought it was.
