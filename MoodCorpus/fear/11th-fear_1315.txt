::sigh::
I am bored.  And I am a little nervous.  Sent an email to a friend explaining some very personal things about me.  I am nervous...I am awaiting the reaction.  I am waiting for the "nutbag" comment.  

Why is it that I say I could care less what people think about me...and then I get so worked up when it pertains to someone I care about?  I know it's silly...I am one of those, "well, if they don't like me for who I am the F*** them" sort of person and then I get scared that no one will want to be around me.

I just like to know where I stand with people before I get tell them something so  personal that it hurts when they don't accept me.  And sometimes I f*** up and tell someone something that they don't want to hear.

I had a friend that I have known since I was 4.  I told her some things about me.  She is no longer my friend.  I haven't seen her in over 12 years.  I miss her sometimes.

God, sometimes I am such an idiot.
