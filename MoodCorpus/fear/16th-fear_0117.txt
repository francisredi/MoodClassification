You know how everyone has (well i believe everyone does) one irrational fear? Well i'm about to admit mine. Possums. *grimaces* It's SO stupid. [stop laughing!] And now i have to do a project on them, and actually go into a room with them (without enclosures) I'm going to try and face this stupid fear, but i'm afraid i'll do something idiotic in front of my class! Like run... No i should be fine... Right?

I'm hating school right now. I barely opened my mouth today. My friends were all giving me strange looks. One friend asked "Aren't you glad to be back at school, to see your friends and all-" Friends... Right... That's what you call them. Lol i leave the room and no one notices, i don't call that friendly. I have friends, just not in school. Which makes school fifty times worse. Hmm, plus i've been trying to lose weight, and it just isn't working. I'm in SUCH a foul mood!

Oh, to top it off i'm having trouble reviewing the book i read, because i read it at the beginning of last term! I barely remember it. I hope it's enough. I just felt my stomach clench, and that reminds me. We have monologues.

I'm probably over-reacting, but stressed.
