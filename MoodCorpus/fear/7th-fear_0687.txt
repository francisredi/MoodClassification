My son, who has aspergers is nine.  He's been having a terrible time at school--acting out sexually.  He went from having an aid 1 hour a day, to having an aid full time just to protect the other kids.  So I start thinking about how weird this is that this kid is acting like this.  I ask him, "Is anybody touching you under your underwear."  Turns out that an older kid who also has aspergers and lives in our building has been touching him.  They've been playing video games together.  

My son is completely clueless and he thinks that this kind of behavior is ok.  He doesn't see what the big deal is about.

I've been devestated.  I feel so terrible about this.  This has been happening in the other boy's apartment.  It seemed safe to me.  The mom is a special ed teacher in our district and knows a lot about aspergers.  The son said that he didn't like moving out of his apartment, so I allowed my son to go down there.  The play room door was always open and the mom seemed present.  
  
So it's been a terrible few weeks.  We took my son into a psychologist who took out the anatomically correct dolls and we found out that the abuse was pretty much limited to touching.  We told the mother, who was shocked.  That was a highly uncomfortable but short conversation.  I told several people at the school.  The school social worker told me that the police won't do anything because the other boy has to be at least five years older and this kid is only four years older than my son.
  
I guess I've done everything I'm supposed to do except I need to talk to the school administration.  I don't like the thought of this woman potentially becoming my son's special ed teacher.  Could this even happen?
  
How have any of you dealt with this kind of thing?  How do you deal with it?  How do you protect these kids who are completely guileless?
