yes i'll have 6000 chicken fajitas............
Ah yes, Saturday work. It went by quite fast, i reorganized the saw blade section. Then my great day turned sour. One distributer, Peter, usually comes in and buys our stuff at cost and sells them out of the back of his van. He is like Michael Jackson, but with teenaged boys and anal sex and all that perverted stuff. Anyways, he came in and did some buying, but he asked me out to dinner. I don't trust this guy at all. I was totally anxious for the rest of the day. After he left, i was told that he'd be back at 4pm to pick me up and to take me to his house. I left early because i was that scared. My heart is still racing right now, i don't think i'll be able to calm down for a while. I'm going to talk to Bill about him and about my anxiety problems. I try and hide it, but it just comes out. I'm terrible at hiding my problems. After that whole ordeal, i walked over to see Jen. I bought her lunch. I felt so messed up, i decided to walk it off. I walked along Dundas to Wharton Way and around back to Jen. We went to the store, i bought bus tickets and paid off my Rogers bill and then we had chicken fajitas. The end.
