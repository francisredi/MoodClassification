How do you know you're in trouble? When it's nearly quarter past midnight, you're giving a presentation at ten the next morning, and you still don't have a clue what you're meant to say. At all. (Even though you conducted succesful raids of the library earlier, and you've even managed to READ a few of the books! Not that it helped. I could write a great ESSAY on the topic... but a presentation? Tomorrow? I'm dead.) (It's all Ireland's fault. XD) I've fallen back onto desperate measures to stay awake - eating sugar cubes. Now waiting for them to kick in... >_<''''

Blagged my way through the presentation today, falling back on sketchy memories of my Art History AS to get through 'the cultural achievements of the renaissance.' (The italian one.) Of course, the tutor stopping me every few minutes to rattle on find pictures explain further helped... though how a ten minute presentation turned into an hour long seminar, I don't know. O_O 

Still, tomorrow is going to kill me dead. She won't help out like that, and I'll be timed to the ten minute limit, as well. *meep* 

...then I have to beg for an extension on the essay due in on Wed, on the grounds that I'm going insane spent all last week in bed with a virus. (As she knows - she got two drugged up e-mails. I was meant to give this last week.) >_<
