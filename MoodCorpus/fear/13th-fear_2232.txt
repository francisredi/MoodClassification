Travis and I have had the death plague for the last few days now.  Not feeling well overall, but characterized by a yucky cough, runny/stuffy nose, and body aches.  He's feeling a little better today, I'm feeling worse.  We have like...3-4 inches of snow already, and looking at a bunch more tonight.  I think its pretty, even though that opinion might get me killed.

On the family front, my mother and I have spoken once.  It resulted in more hurt and pain on both sides, although I think that i was very calm and kind, trying to explain my point of view.  The worst part of this is that over the last few months, the only thing that made me happy and secure was thinking about/planning the wedding.  Now, even thinking about the wedding makes my stomach turn.  I dont know what to do.  This is really the first time in my life I've ever had to accept my mother as someone with flaws and imperfections like everyone else.  My father and I reached this point on other topics a long time ago, and I've reconciled myself to our differences of opinion.  My mother and I have just never had this kind of blowout, and it kills.  I hope that we can ride this out and get things fixed.  I just want to be happy, and them to be happy.

I withdraw from school tomorrow.  This is a big leap in to a totally new direction.  I really feel this is the right decision for me, but I'm terrified.  I hope I'm right.
