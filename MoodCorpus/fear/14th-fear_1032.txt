Are there no shadows where you are?
I will admit this much:

I've thought about you everyday. I've cried about you everyday for the past week and two days. I've written so many letters, only to crumple them up and throw them in the trashcan at the far side of my room. I've had conversations in my head. I've talked to the air. I sit outside and look at the moon, wondering if you're doing the same. I've held your number in my hands and I never dial it. I've read and reread all your letters. I drown in my thoughts of you. We never had a rough patch 'til now, and I want to believe it's nothing fried pickles and a battle of Kung-Fu can't solve. But it isn't that easy. If you knew half of what I've gone through this week, if you knew a third of what thoughts crossed my mind, it would be enough to scare you away from me forever. I have my own reasons for keeping my distance, and although they will never make sense to you, I stay where I am. I've walked around with my eyes on the ground, not daring to breathe. There's a cloud looming overhead, one I cannot shake. I don't know what to do. I promised myself everyday I would go up and talk to you. I'm not sure why I'm so hesitant, why I'm scared. I know you would be the light in my day, you'd make me smile and laugh and feel okay. Everyday I think our problem will be magically solved and we can jump right back into good memories. You should've torn up every word I ever wrote to you. I'm of no reassurance and I'm definitely not worth it. If I went up to you and talked to you, I'd only be pulling you into the current. I'd be making you suffer. Silence breaks the heart, I know, but my confessions will tear us apart. (And no, that wasn't meant to rhyme).
