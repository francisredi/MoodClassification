slippery slope
I know it hurt so bad because I was holding on to hope. I was holding on to the hope that with time he would want me back. But you know what that hope has to go. No hope or time or anything else is going to make us right together and when I am painfully honest with myself about it that's what it boils down to. I know we are not right together and I am scared to face that. I am scared to face the fact that he was right and I felt it to. I wanted it to be real so badly and I wanted it to be right. He just had the stones to do what I never wanted to do. And that what's I need to work on. Myself self-esteem is so low right now I am willing to settle and apparently fight for something that isn't right. And that's what I need to work on.The why's behind that. And I need to do that by myself If him and I are meant to be friends than someday we will be. I just need time to work on me right now. I do wish him the best and it hurts like hell, but if this girl is good for him then, I wish them the best too. He wasn't right for me but he deserves to be right with someone. It's weird I have learned fear and love feel a lot alike and hurt sucks my ass
