Strange Things
I think for the first time in a really long time, I talked to somebody about things I've been thinking about before writing about it.

I should find out pretty soon if I get the job at Old Navy...or get a second interview or whatever. I'm nervous. I really want it.

I am nervous about meeting with Dr. Higgs today and about my SPE final tonight. Normally I wouldn't be nervous about Joan's class but after the last few weeks, my grade mojo has been pretty low. So I have no confidence in how well I'll do. Its a little ridiculous considering that I've gotten a 98% and a 100% on the two tests we've had in there. I should be fine. But I'm getting my project back today and I know that it was less than stellar. Well, I guess I shouldn't say that. I actually worked really hard on it but I didn't have time to completely finish it. That was the problem.

Anyway, I have to finish up a couple things for Dr. Higgs now and then shower and stuff.

Pray for me to get through today okay. I'm just at the end of my rope.

Tonight I'll probably feel a lot better.
