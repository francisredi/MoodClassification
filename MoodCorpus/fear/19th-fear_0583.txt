Eep!
Okay, so I just talked to the Principal about the scary guy ... apparently, she didn't know anything about it, so I guess the VP didn't meet with her about it.  That's not to say the VP didn't do her job -- I'm sure she did, she just didn't involve the principal.  Anyway, the principal (I'm going to call her "Debra" from here on out because it seems weird to call her "the principal") made me promise to call the police and follow up on it.  

There's an officer on the way right now.

I am incredibly nervous.  I mean, it's no big deal, right?  He's just going to ask some questions, probably, and it's not like anything really bad has happened.  Everyone's OK.  But I guess I had put it comfortably in the back of my mind and forgot about it, and now I'm as shaky as I was when the guy accosted me.

Whatever.  I just want to make sure nobody gets hurt.  I need to make that my focus, not my own fear, right?  Calm.

Why are police officers so scary?  But only to people who shouldn't be scared -- criminals never seem too intimidated by them.
