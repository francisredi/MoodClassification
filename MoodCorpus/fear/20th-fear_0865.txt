...What exactly is going on here, boys?
Finally got myself a Roxas. First muse I ever even wanted to go looking for. Axel wanted one, and I couldn't write what Axel demands wants me to write with a Roxas. So I went looking.

Except now they're looking at each other, and Axel looks a little guilty and a little scared, and Roxas just looks...bad, and I'm trying to figure out what the hell is going on in my brain. Although I really don't want to know because the last time someone looked like Axel does, it was Touga and he'd just completely screwed with Saionji's head because Akio told him to. And knowing the fire wielding, death-bringing, slightly xenophobic harlequin in my head, I imagine there are a lot of things he could do. 

 In other news, I'm strangely nervous about getting my PPD tuberculosis test read tomorrow. It's not giving any signs of being positive at all (mostly, it's red and bruised. But not hard or puffed up so that means negative) but...I'm still nervous. Damn health test. Oh well, once this is done I can mail the "Hey, I'm healthy enough to live overseas" form to JET and be done with that.
