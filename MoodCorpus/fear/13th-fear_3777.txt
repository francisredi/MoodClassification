feeling alone.......
have you ever had a moment where you feel like you may have lost someone or are going to lose them? lately thats how i feel.  this kind of feeling makes me realize how much i love her.  how i wish i knew how to show her that i still love her...that she still gives me that feeling that you cant explain. i dont think she realizes i still feel this way.  i have tried to tell her but then my mind says no dont say it what if she doesnt feel that way.  what if she doesnt? what if she is only settling? what if she really wants to be with that other girl you have feared since the first day you met her? the only thing left to do is to hold on to her and hope that the girl you have feared doesnt say those right words that maybe you should have said. everyday i fear to hear you say that you dont want to be with me.  does this mean i fear love?  maybe she does feel the same way about me.  what if she doesnt want anything but friendship out of that other girl? what if she isnt settling? what if this is exactly what the both of us want? if this is the case is she just telling that other girl those things for the attention? she seems like she loves me, like she never wants to leave me, like she still gets that feeling she cant explain.  

i come here to try and let go of things but i cant help but hold on to them.  there are some people in this world that have just done me wrong to many times.  i cant trust these people anymore.  i try but i just end up getting hurt again.  g.a.- i wish someone would just tell me what the right thing to do was.....
