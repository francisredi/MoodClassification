I've Moved!!!
I moved all my crap to my new home yesterday.  I was up since 6:45am because I was so excited and couldn't wait.  Terence got here with an u-haul at 11am and I was all moved in by 1pm.  I was so anxious and worried about my parents and how they would feel about me moving.  In the end, my parents got in their car and helped me move all my stuff into the apartment, they drove Terence and me around looking for a mattress and they were polite to him.  Can I admit that I never thought that I would be able to have both my parents and Terence in the same place, at the same time without hurting someone.  But yesterday I felt loved, loved because my parents helped me even though I know they were terrified, loved because Terence woke up at 7:30am on a Sunday (which has never happened before) to help me move, loved because so many people listened to me, gave me advice, encouraged me and listened to me bable oon when I was scared.  

What's really great is that I don't feel like I am making the biggest mistake of my life anymore.  Of course, my mother just talked me into buying a $600 mattress which I am trying to deal with and rationalize.  If anyone out there has any good reasoning for spending so much money on a mattress, not a bed, but a mattress please let me know so that I'll stop feeling guilty.  

I came back to my parents' house to sleep last night but I'll be going to my new place today.  I am a little scared especially since we don't have the internet, phone, or cable hooked up yet.  I guess I'm worried that I'll feel alone.  One of my very good friends came to help me move and it was so great to see her because she understood all the fears I was having because her parents are very much like mine.  And when we talked she reaffirmed that I was making the right decision, that this would be good, and that she would be coming over all the time now.  

My mother said to me today that I needed to behave like a woman now...I guess maybe I'm a woman now.
