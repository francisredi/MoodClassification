"Details for the friends though"
If you knew or not, I got verbally attacked last week by two people in repetition (one of my other journal things have one part of one.) Now usually, i am one to go "shrug off/fuck it" but what they were saying really hurt me. Like, kinda hit a nerve that doesn't get hit often. And like, it has made it hard for me to go back into the fray and begin to post stuff again (friday being the first time with D. Adonis). It has messed with the confidence i use to have when posting my "stuff" on the forum. Like, will it happen again? Will i get them more frustrated?

This has also broken the will to continue with FO's CG, which is now 14 days in progress. Which is way too long, I just can't seem to get up and do it, let alone anything really art related at that. I've also been very bothered with my current "trend" because my project is growing close to due, and if i can't focus to do it, I'll wont do good at all. I really don't want a 2nd last semester. 

I am having a nasty circle of emotional yahooy going on. 
When i slack off, i get tense, when i get tense, i clench my teeth, when i do that, i hurt my head/body, when that happens i slack off. Violent Circle a gogo. One of which thats gotta go!
