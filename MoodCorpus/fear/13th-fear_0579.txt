The bitter taste of success
Our show went fantastically. My cast either loved doing it, or are all very good liars. The audiences loved it - they can't possibly all be that good liars. Technically, I *should* get money out of the project b/c we spent almost nothing on the production, and I know they sold 150+ tickets. But considering they COMPLETELY (and I wonder if perhaps simply due to negligence from lack of concern) dropped the ball on advertising, and they couldn't even deliver 2 ITEMS to a cast party that THEY wanted to have, I can't imagine they'll get their act together enough to actually pay me.

Ah, but that is neither here nor there. The subject of this post is really about finding something I'm good at and despairing of making a living at it. I never really thought about making a living at directing, and how silly to have one success make you start thinking about it. And we're using "success" here somewhat loosely since we had a grand total audience of about 200 people. Its not like I sold out the place for month. Regardless, I am thinking about it. How unlikely is it that I could find enough creative endeavors to make a living. Music, theater, etc.

It just kind of sucks, in a sickeningly sweet kind of way, to think you might actually be pretty good at something and it just feels like things should start happening, but if it does, its pretty much completely at the whim of chance.

I think I'm a little scared that this high will completely die and boring life will take hold again. Its harder to face compared with something so much better.

Success is a tease. A big, horrible tease. I know what it would take to really pursue creative things for a living, we're doing it now for Mike's radio career. It'd just be so nice if things would happen for me at the same time, since I'm here, doing nothing else of value anyway

I can take some solace in my fast car, and maybe in the meantime I can pretend I'll be a really good race car driver.
