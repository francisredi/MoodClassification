Would anyone remember me...?
If I downloaded Trillian again on this computer, would anyone even know who I am anymore?  I find myself wishing I still had a messenger program; I miss my friends dearly, and feel the need to talk to someone.

Why do the smallest things seem to be huge catastrophies in my mind?  Why can I not forget about them, no matter how hard I try?  Why can't I shut my brain off, even just for a few hours?  Why do I feel like I'm going to fail before even trying?  Why am I so afraid?

Why can I not tell someone to shut the hell up because they're highly annoying and childish?  Why do I always worry about their problems even though it wears me out and I swear up and down that I don't give a fuck, and I really don't give one?  Why am I so afraid of confrontations that I dig my own grave instead of telling this person to just leave me alone?

Why is it so easy to put me on a guilt trip?  Why can I even give myself a guilt trip?  Why do I semi-consciously care so much, even when I've gotten to the point where I don't consciously care?
