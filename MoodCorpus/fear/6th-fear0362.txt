True courage
2 hours west of us, bushfires burn out of control at Erica. The sky has had that awful orange tint I remember from the horrifying fires of Christmas 2004 and Ash Wednesday, when about 20 people, including several firefighters died, and thousands of square acres of bushland was destroyed.

We are safe, for now at least. The real worry is Moe, a town of some 8,000 people where we have friends. Only 200 brave  volunteer firemen stand between Moe and destruction. Unless the wind changes, or we get rain..it is so like Bright, in December 2004 when roughly the same number of volunteers knew they would die if the wind did change, and blow the fire towards the town. Yet none of them wavered, all, mostly young men, were ready to die to give the Bright townsfolk an extra hour's time to flee. And die they would have, no fire hose ever invented could have halted that inferno.

Please, some prayers or thoughts for rain would help! I shudder to think of those brave men dying in vain, hoping for the families to be able to leave Moe in time.
