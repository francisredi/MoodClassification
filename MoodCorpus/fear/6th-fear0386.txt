I have a problem!
Actually... several.

1. I'm having some chest discomfort/shortness of breath. It started this morning when I was standing up in one place (not moving around) for too long before eating breakfast. I got a bit light-headed. I felt like i needed to sit down... but I was waiting to talk to my co-worker about some work, so I stayed standing there. That was at about 9 this morning. I figured the light heardedness was from not having had breakfast yet. But, also, my chest began to hurt a lil. It's more of discomfort than stabbing pain. Combined withthe shortness of breath, and I'm worried. Not to mention a lil back pain - but that could be from any one of the muscle knots that I have in my back - and that is what it feels like.

 Still - it's 12:48 pm - and on a much smaller magnitude, the pain and stuff are still bothering me.

2. It never even occured to me to go and see Mike at his work last night after MB and I got back to her house from band. Is there something wrong with me because he wasn't that far onto my mind to go and see him?????????? This is a very real question for me.


HELP!
