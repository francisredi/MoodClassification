So.  Looks like I'm moving to Des Moines.  I'm quitting the car store Thursday (as in, tomorrow) and taking off next month (hopefully) for the land of milk and honey.  And by milk and honey, I mean marketing jobs and sexy professional guys.  That's heaven if you ask me.  So if you live in or near CR and want to see me, call me.  Now.  And wish me luck finding a job next week... I just sent in a bazillion resumes on Careerbuilder (which does the Des Moines Register's classifieds), and I need to find a job before I can get an apartment, which I have to do before the end of the month so I can get the cheap rent special at the amazing apartment place!

Of course, I'm scared shitless.  It's probably a bad idea to quit before I have a new job lined up, but working 55 hours a week doesn't really allow for trips to Des Moines for interviewing.  Plus I am beyond stressed at this job... I'm sick of all the bullshit.  LOTS of bullshit.  So if you pray, pray for me.  If not, cross your fingers.  I'm crossing everything.  I'll try to uncross my eyes for interviews.

Holy crap.  This all happened in less than a week.  Does that qualify for quarter-life crisis?  I think so.  I can only wonder what the mid-life crisis will be.... yikes...
