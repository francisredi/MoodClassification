Post Surgery Update
Hey everyone!

I want to thank all of you for all the emails and get well wishes, and for the chats online.  You all helped me so much.  Each communication meant so much to me! 

I also want to say a special thanks to Jenn, my wonderful girlfriend who has helped me so so so much! She is the best anyone could have in their life! I love her very very much!

I had my post Op check-up earlier and had my cast and staples taken out of my leg.  My leg is looking pretty good, some bruising, swelling, but nothing major.  I've got to use the short leg walker, its a big black boot thing some of you have seen me in already, for 3-4 weeks.  I am to use the crutches as needed. I go back for a check up in June to hopefully get released from the short walker. They want another MRI then just in case there are any problems in the future. So now the worst part is over, now I have to get to walking again and then get a job and pay off these bills!

Been really anxious and nervous lately, I have been having a hard time sleeping, I dont know if its from all of this with the leg itself or the financial aspect of it.  I just want to be able to relax and feel confident that its all going to be okay.  I keep trying to tell myself that it will and things are going pretty good, its just I can't shake the anxiety, not yet anyway. I'll get past it, I have to. 

Bless all of you and thanks again!
