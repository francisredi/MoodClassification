Night Terrors
Dearest C.,

Know that I post this here as way of respecting your silence, your choice to not communicate. It, perhaps, a testament to my own disease that I can't simply write this in my journal. 

It is the middle of the night. I am leaving our shared ancestral home to return to the place of misery, madness, and free parking. My alarm is set for 4:30a.m. to make my 6:00am flight. I dreamed that you tortured me in a tropical island paradise. I am still shaken. I was staying at a Mom & Pop B&B. We were broken, in the ways that we often are. You found me, drugged me, bound me, and had other torture and humiliate me. You were particularly cruel in your indifference to my suffering. Although you convinced my neighbors and the proprietors that it was simply a kinky sex scene, you recruited a Domme and a new/old male sexfriend to actually hurt me as payback for the ways that I've hurt you. Every time I cried or screamed or came unhinged you turned colder. It was as if my pain was an affront to you. My pain fueled your anger. There was end to your vengeance. I ran away. As I was running, I ran into you. I saw the expression on your face and I woke myself up. As I dreamed, I thought to myself, "This is a dream! I just need to wake up!" In my dream, I tried -- and failed -- to wake up and my nightmare continued. I am so shaken. I AM unhinged. There was no mercy in your eyes, only rage fueled by righteousness. You were a Fury made real. I am afraid to sleep lest I find you again in my dreams.
