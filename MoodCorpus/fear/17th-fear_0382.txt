Nightmare.
I don't know what i'm doing up.

I was just blankly staring at my email address inbox, waiting or something for anything to happen, and mindlessly checking final fantasy 11, and myspace, and what the fuck ever else.

I just had a nightmare of something chasing me through town, and it was invisible, but i could hear it's laughter. Also, it had telekinetic powers that it used to beat things upon me. :/
Then i woke up, and felt something watching me, standing next to my bed. No danger, just creepily watching.
In fact, i can still feel it's eyes on me.
I went to bed at 2 am, and woke up at 4:15am. 
It felt like i should have been asleep for hours. I was expecting to see the dawn outside when i woke up, and there was only darkness.

It wasn't even a nightmare about anything too scary.
And yet, it affected me quite a bit.


... i wonder what's going on.. i'll find out eventually, you know.
