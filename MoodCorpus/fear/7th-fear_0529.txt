I've been lethargic and grumpy this week. I've gotten stuff done (still on track for the next podcasting book deadline) but haven't *felt* like I've done anything. Am absolutely convinced the stuff I wrote last week is shit. 

In other news, I talk at Duke tomorrow about D&D. I feel like I should be scared or nervous, but I'm not, really. Honestly I'm more nervous about getting lost and parking in the wrong lot. I'm not being paranoid - it's happened before. At Duke. You become the inept idiot who makes other people late for work and no matter how many times you apologize they still hate you.

Man I'm sounding sour. I'm not even in that bad of a mood. I'd *really* like to get some good sleep tonight. Think happy thoughts for me tomorrow afternoon. This could get messy. I'm running a dungeon crawl for four lvl 1 characters played by college kids who very likely have never rolled dice in their life.
