not breathing well right now
I just woke up for a really distrubing nightmare.  All about dead bodies burried in houses, "things" in gigundo versions of the lemon-shaped bottels being drowned in the lake (I suspect they were really more dead bodies), a gigantic overly-friendly fish like thing (think body-muppet in water) with three eyes, a dolphin that was either swimming in air next to us or we were waist deep in water the whole time, and Corsairs as in singing pirates - at leat two of them were in the basement with me taking about where the bodies were burried.  No, I don't know which ones were there.  It's a dream!

No, it was a nightmare.  I'm now afraid to go back to sleep because I'm afraid the dead bodies that are burried in a space that doesn't exist in my house are going to get me.

It's really rather distressing.  And more scary than I'm liking thinking about.  It's been a very long time since I was so scared to be alone in this house.
