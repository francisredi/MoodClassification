Scared
I figured I'd post in here because I don't have too many friends in my livejournal and those who might read this I really wouldn't mind if they hear what im about to say.  99% of the time that people see me I'm a happy and care free person.  But what they don't know is that even though that's how I may seem, on the inside I am an absolute wreck.  I have a constant overwhelming sense of dread following me everywhere I go.  Though I hide it for the most part.  Occasionally these feelings surface, most of the time I'm alone when it happens.  But when they do happen I have a total breakdown.  Some of the things that I think about are just too horrible to even think about.  I think that one of the worst of these thoughts is when I think about Cait and I put myself in situations where she dumps me or cheats on me.  I know she would never do either of these...well I at least know that she won't cheat on me, there may be some day down the road that she'll want to break up with me.  I know at this point that I never want to do that.  I care about her too much.  But when I put myself in these positions I get really scared that there is even the slightest possiblity that it could happen.  And no matter how much I try and convince myself that it won't happen and no matter how much I try to stop thinking about these things I still can't help but think about them....  I'm scared.
