Confused and scared...
1 in 206... That's a pretty far off chance of hitting that 1. When that 1 is the only chance to live, you're pretty much told that is it, might as well call it quits because chances are, that 205 others will be your end. Never the less, that 1 exist so you feel a sence of hope that things might turn out better but what if the odds are different? If you have a 1 in 206 chances of something being wrong, your odds are pretty darn good, right? 

well then, why such fear? Today I had a message on the phone asking me to come talk to a the nurse about some test results. So I'm worried a bit, then when we get there, the nurse does her standard procedures and tells me not to worry, its not a big deal. Me and marq sit there waiting for at least an hour after that, having fun in the waiting room. Nurse finally comes in and tells us that they found a protien in my blood that shows a 1 in 206 chance that our baby can have down syndrom. 1 in 206. not 1 in 10 or 1 in 2. this is .0048% of a chance which to them is considered high risk. the more she talks, the more i get worried. as soon as she leaves the tears start flowing. we have no family history of down so I'm hoping my side leans more to the 205 than the 1. but still, I'm scared thinking the worse. I'm going for genetics counseling on the 2 of may and then have an ultrasound specialized in detecting down on the 24. They might want to me take a test where I run the risk of losing the baby. Just scary but I'm hoping for the best. Just wish this fear will go away.
