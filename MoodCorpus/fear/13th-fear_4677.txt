Debate
okay, okay. I leave for my provincial debate in less than an hour and I'm sooooooooooooooooooooooo nervous. All the laid back attude is crashing down now. I'm scared i'm scared, oh i'm so scared. No one is going to be there all weekend, I know my dad is dropping me off and maybe comming Sunday... but *whine* i don' think anyone is going to be there. and I have to share a room with a stranger *whine* i'm so scared scared scared scared.

I wanna stay home and do nothing... why do people keep telling me i'll do fine and good luck and hopefully nationals????? its that last part that bothers me, it makes me scared. my coach sent me an e-mail and told me good luck and to take one of the spots for nationals. I can't do this. There is like 100 people and i think onyl the top like 7 go on to nationals. thats totally not going to happen. I'm SCARED SOMEONE HELP ME PLEASE!!!
