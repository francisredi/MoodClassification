Craptacular day.
On my way to the courthouse where I do my job every day, I found myself in a car accident.  I am fine, mostly.  I have a burn on my left hand from the freakin' air bag and I'm jumpy and emotional, but otherwise ok.  My car, on the other hand, is another story.  I don't know what happened.  I was driving along, listening to my book on ipod, cruising along in normal traffic and then I don't know what happened, and I'm looking at my deployed airbag and trying to figure out what the hell just happened.  Apparently, I hit a pickup truck that hit the car in front of it, who were all stopped at a light.  Guy in pickup is fine, one of the people in the car went to the hospital for a checkup.  I have a court date for a week after EClipse for Wreckless Driving.  A friend of mine picked me up, took me to the courthouse to do my job, and then drove me to my wonderful superboss's house to pick up his truck that he's lending me (again!  I swear if I could canonize my boss, I would).  Off to Chipotle and the local gaming store for a bit of retail therapy and now I'm home.

I am home, alone.  Nothing hurts more than wanting to curl up in someone's arms and not having any to do that with.  I am shaken up, scared of what's going to happen now, and alone.  So many questions (Can my car be fixed?  Will my insurance drop me?  How long will it take to fix?  Is everyone else involved going to be ok?).
