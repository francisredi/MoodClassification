AM musing
It occurs to me that on the whole, I've felt worse since leaving prison than I did while I was inside. I'm not sure what it is, probably the antidepressant od's they were giving me.. but in prison there was something to work to, a goal.. even if it was just getting the things together to make the next model, holding myself together till the next letter.. waiting for my release date. Now though, I feel like I'm freewheeling backwards down a hill. I have no drive, no hopes, no motivations..   semeingly no chance of ever finding work in Aberystwyth.. hell even in Liverpool. At times I'm reaching the level of wanting it all to go away that prompted me to go jam myself into the mains in prison. I can remember a teacher at school asking my form tutor if she thought I'd ever try and kill myself as I was so alienated.. and she thought I could never do it as I'd always either cope or joke about it. Where did all my humour go. 
It's at times like these I think Satan was lucky to get stabbed in Aberystwyth.. but when they try it on me they need to aim higher and with a much bigger knife to make sure. 
I shouldn't be so whiny. i have friends who worry about me, a family who cares about my well being. On the whole, I have it lucky compared to some no doubt. Still, it doesn't stop me wanting to eat a bullet every day when I wake up. I need to go see a doctor about that.. and about my sleep pattern.
