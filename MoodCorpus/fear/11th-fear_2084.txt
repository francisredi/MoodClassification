I don't have a clever little saying for my subject to embody what I'm about to say
I'm really nervous about this first History test. I really enjoy the class although my teacher is quite mad and a bit of an ass. I think his test is going to be insane, just like him. His multiple choice questions are infamous. I fucking hate multiple choice. He is one of those tricksy teachers. Well...at least I care. I've studied, probably not enough, but I have nonetheless. I don't think it can hurt me. I'm just venting. I am sure if anybody even reads my journals they are scrolling down as I speak because this is boring. I should be writing it in my real journal you say. Well, it's in the fucking car and it is cold outside so fuck you! 

Can anybody tell me how to change my little icon that displays my mood into something a little bit more clever that the faces? Oh and sorry for saying fuck you, especially if you are still reading.
