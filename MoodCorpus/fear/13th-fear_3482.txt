so i had quite the horrifying dream last nite. and it reccurred throughout the night. i woke up at various intervals, told myself to think of something else, went back to bed and picked up where i left off. k so for the dream:

DECA at school was actually a cult and they sucked in the Armada and it turned out that DECA was at war with another gang. And the initiation ceremony consisted of my boss from mcdonalds leading us out onto the train tracks and shooting random people that were being initiated. So naturally i was quite frightened and ran for it while my boss chased me down firing shots at me. (remarkably i didn't trip over the thrid rail on the train tracks) but yes so i got away and from then on i lived in fear at school that an attempt would be made on my life. Several instances occurred where i was in my car and saw shadowy figures with guns and i had to climb under the dashboard to get out of sight. There was also something else about me sneaking into an arena through a hole in the wall and i don't know why but i had to get in there. Once there i saw people with guns and left.  also for some reason the rapper biggy smalls was there and i was like i know how you feel brother with all these folks shooting at me. and he just grunted. And i don't clearly remember but i believe Becky was shot for not complying with the cult rules. Akira betrayed us all and became one of the DECA leaders with Le Franc which was horrifying as well and Franc was one of the ones after me with a gun. in the end i drove a getaway car for some time in case i was ever in the situation where i needed protection from enemy fire. Finally there was a peace treaty signed in my backyard, i killed my boss at some point i don't remember when but i remember she was dead at my hands, and all was well. however at the time of the dream, the insecent shooting was quite scary
