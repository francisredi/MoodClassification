Graduation
So despite the rain, thunder and lightning, blisters, being beaten with an umbrella by the person behind me, having my cap fall off in the mud that I was standing in and my beautiful white Liberal Arts tassel becoming all stained, totally not seeing people I wanted to see (read: one beautiful, long-legged blonde who answers to the name of Katie), not even crying once but gagging constantly, and being drugged on Xanax -- I fucking graduated.&nbsp; I now have a completely useless degree.

Judy Woodruff was okay.&nbsp; I'm glad she didn't take the honorary doctorate, I probably would have beaten her after commencement for it.

My mom's having surgery tomorrow afternoon -- parathyroid surgery for the third damn time -- and I'm nervous as I always am.

I have a job interview on Thursday with the Wal-Mart in New Albany, fifteen minutes from my house.&nbsp; My mom's excited that my degree might lead me to management opportunities.&nbsp; Geez.&nbsp; I just want a job and she's excited that I might actually move out, which is kinda scary.&nbsp; But New Albany is not home, but it's still Mississippi.&nbsp; Not exactly what I was looking for, but, oh well.

After graduation is very lonely.
