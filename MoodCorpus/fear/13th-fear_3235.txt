copied from (and edited) Jenny's belated journal entry, because I couldnt say it better myself
Sometimes you need food, sometimes you hurt yourself, sometimes you need to medicate.....All of these are generally unhealthy choices, for dealing with stress and general bad days and things happening to you. 

But sometimes, all you need is a smile to make it all better. 

No, I don't binge eat. No I don't cut. And no, I don't ingest (Or inhale, or inject) narcotics. And I'm not even the one having a bad day. Yes, yesterday did have a triple whammy, but that was yesterday. But, I see many people that just aren't too "happy" right now. 

Yes, it IS suicide season again. It's always a tense time, because I am acquainted with quite a few people who do suffer from acute to severe depression. 

So. My job today: To put a smile on all of their faces. 

And MY smile is a particular exude of love, with a certain bioluminescence that can only be found in this month. 

Be careful of the ice today.
