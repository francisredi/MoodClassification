one two, buckle my shoe, three four, run for the door!
I sometimes wonder if this might be the apocolypse. Not that i actually believe that we're all going to perish. I'm not going to go around with a sign shouting "THE END IS NEAR!" But all these disasters, hurricanes, mine's calapsing - all these natural disasters make me wonder. Perhaps there was a climate change or jsut reasons for it. I know that there seem to be cycles where lots of hurricanes and such occur. but what if - hypothetically - it is the slow destruction of our world and preparation for judgment day? Couldn't it be? Or if you don't believe in God, just the armageddon? Hell - an asteroid came rather close to colliding with the Earth this week. We didn't hear about it cuz it was pretty far away, but it was really close in astronomical terms. 

so what if all this is just the slow desitigration of the planet? I can't help but thinking of this with every disaster i hear about. but then again perhaps you all think i'm crazy. Couldn't say that i'd blame you. But i just wonder sometimes.
