Perspective.
My friend potentially has a hole in her heart and will need heart surgery.  Heart surgery.  She is 23 years old.  I know that they are really good at those things now but it scares me.  Especially after watching Grey's Anatomy.

She may just have a murmur (which could mean if she wants more kids than it could cause problems  - and it would be something to watch) and that is what we are hoping for.  

I'm trying to be very upbeat and positive with her.  But it scares the shit out of me.  She has a five year old son so her health doesn't just affect her (of course it affects her family and friends, but not in the same way) - it affects someone else's entire existence.

I'm sure she'll be fine.  But I'm a little scared.

I told her that I would come home (to MN) to be with her if she has heart surgery and joked that she was going above and beyond to trick me into coming home so soon.
