Scary Storms!
The storms today were awful! Here's the quick rundown cause I'm tired and wanna go lay down:

10:45 This horrible wind is blowing so hard I had to get under the desk at the Fuel station cause I thought it was a tornado. The power goes out and all thats left is the front computer and the light in the front. I lower the blinds, and try to call the store but no one is there. 

So then I call the Kroger West Help thingie in Louisville and they are having me do stuff to try and get the power back up. While I'm talking to them I see two police cars, two fire trucks and an ambulance racing up the street and up to the store. I'm really freaking out now. Finally the guy on the phone tells me that theres no way to fix it unless Facilities comes, so they will call them. I still have to count down the till. I look outside and see that crap has been moved. These really heavy 12-pack soda holders were moved, the coke machine was knocked over and in the parking lot the cart corral's were moved! I saw them moving them and the guys nearly pissed their pants because they didn't know I was even in there at the time! Sharon freaks out and comes running, asking if I was okay and I showed them all the damage that the winds caused. They told me there was smoke in the store and that they had to call the fire dep. again because there was still smoke. They went back to the store and I finished up -finally-! This is at 12:00 now, and I stand around and explain to Mrs. Baker what happened, then later to the elecrician. ...It's been a LONG NIGHT. Ugh.
