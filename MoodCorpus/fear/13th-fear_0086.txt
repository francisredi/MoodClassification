In my life, i feel so alone sometimes. Today, yesterday, and the day before, i have felt nothing but lonliness and alone. I dont have many people in my life that are extremely close, but the ones i do have, i dont want to let go. Perhaps i have to let Harley go, but i dont want to. He doesnt know this, but for him to leave my life and for us to not have a relationship right now, scares me shitless. I am afraid so badly. We are horrible to eachother sometimes...just both of us, are downright rude to eachother. But, to have him by my side after all that, and to have him lay and hold me at night is amazing to me. I am scared to be alone and to be without him. He is different to me. He isnt like other guys. 

I am afraid. I acted all macho earlier, and said i'd watch his mom's house and their animals while she's in FL. on Wednesday for a week. Now, i'm scared horribly. I am locking the doors at like 9pm everynight, closing all the curtains and rolling up on the couch. I'm scared out here by myself, but Harley said it's not a 2 person job. It's not, but i figured he'd come out here anyways, just to stay with me and have fun...but, he's not going to. Maybe i need to be alone. Even if it's only for a week. 

I hate being alone, i hate it.
