i am so scared right now
mono. the doctor is finally sure for once in her life that i have mono. and why shouldnt she be? my throat is so swollen and covered with pus that i cant eat, swallow, breathe correctly, or form words. i have our last performance in two days. the one we are filming. and the opera festival. if i cant go on in the opera friday, sarah hersh will sing my part. i love sarah and shit, but i wanna sing my part. dammit i earned it. this is not fair, gods of sickness. someone from the met is coming to watch the show. its my big chance to get noticed. i cant blow it now. im not a religious person, but i sure as hell am praying to somebody that this thing clears up. i cant sleep. im not allowed to go to school until monday. the painkiller is NOT working. sometimes when i open my mouth to speak i drool on myself like a fucking two year old. and its not funny or cute. its humiliating. everything hurts. there is one up side tho. i get excused from gym for 6 weeks. but other than that, im freakin out here. dont call me cuz i cant talk, but please IM me and keep me company. no ones here and im miserable. this entire entry sounds self pitying and asking for sympathy, but i dont care. im scared. someone talk to me.
