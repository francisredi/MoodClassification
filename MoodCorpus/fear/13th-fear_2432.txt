that feeling....
I hate this feeling.  Like I know everything is good right now, but deep down in the bottom of my stomach I feel like it's too good to be true.  School is ok.  I do really need to try a little harder in certain places, but man, I need a break.
I see myself smiling more lately.  That makes me really happy.  I even got a new job....kind of exciting.  But then that crappy feeling comes.  I feel like in s snap of a finger everything is going to just fuck up.  I feel like school is gona go down hill.  I feel like I'm going to probably hate work.  I'm scared to think about next year and living in my first home.  I'm scared I won't keep the friends that I truly love forever.  And I'm scared that finally when I'm actually really happy with the guy I'm dating it's all going to come crashing before me.
I feel my stomach tightening and tightening, but I just want it to stop.  I wish I could take a deep breath and say, "dude, it's fine, just be happy", but it isn't that easy for me.  When people say they have flaws in life, I'd probably say that's my biggest one.  I need to just trust fate, and know that whatever happens is meant to happen.
