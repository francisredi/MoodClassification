Scary Shit
i have not been so scared in my life before. I spent last evening researching SRS(sexual reassignment surgery) doctors and methods. I have been looking at pictures as well as reading accounts of other's experience when they actually had the surgery. It's scary shit. To know that is what will happen to you, is just scary. I keep thinking about how I wanted something better for my life. I wish I could have a family and so forth. But, as a guy I am miserable. Everyday that I have pushed to move forward in becoming a woman with exception of gorey research I have been happier. I can't tell you I was ever happier then this past friday and saturday. 
      Next thing i am totally phobically scared of is coming out at work. I know I will have some support, but I also know I will make some powerful enemies. I have to be prepared to be strong and deal/accept that. My greatest worry, in all honesty is disappointing the people who got me to where I am at work. I want to bring them success not headaches. 
       I am off work today, I do not know all that I am going to do besides clean up yet. I want to see X-men 3. I may go do that here pretty quickly. I want to save money, but staying here all day won't help to much.
