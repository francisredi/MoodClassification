you should all be proud of me that i made it through almost 4 whole years at alma college without being a victim of the small-school-information-spreading-phenomenon. but i have just had my first experience and i now fully understand the frustrations and hurt people feel when stuff they'd like to know gets around to everyone else very quickly. I don't mean to be vague (this is probably the first ambiguous lj entry i've written...1st time for everything) but it sucks to be the 30th person to know something when you should be the first. i am doing my best to be a big girl now that i know how everything is turning out. this is actually probably the best for all involved, but it just hurts a whole lot. I've never had this kind of heartbreak before. i've never loved anyone this much before so naturally i've never been so upset about losing anyone. my education is complete; i can now accept my degree. think about this: in a short time, i have been instructed in broken hearts, alma rumor mill, and nondescript journal writing. i already read some harry potter so i guess the only thing left for me is facebook. then i will understand everyone else.

i wish you both the best, honestly. i will repeat myself by saying that even though i'm very upset and very hurt and make it clear by crying half the time, that does not mean i don't think this is a good idea. if it weren't for the few things that both charlie and i have learned or will learn from this, i might say that it would have been a good idea a year ago. 

i may take it to the extreme, but i think we all need to express ourselves...out of respect and out of wisdom. it's hard to confront people about serious things, but the benefits far outweigh the discomfort. 

please help me get though my last 4 weeks. i'll put in all of my own effort, but please help me in addition. protect my eyes. 

i love everyone.
