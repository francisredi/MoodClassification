On to the next round...
Fourth specialist I have been sent to for the pains that have kept me out of work for a month now finally saw me today. He is just as stumped at the moment too, so now lucky me, I am prepping for surgery tomorrow.

I got all this fun (aka nasty) stuff to drink so I can get a colonoscopy tomorrow. :( I hope they figure this out soon. I am SO tired and stressed out from all of this. Every motion hurts and makes it feel like the virtual dull spike in my side is being twisted, instead of just slowly boring thru me. Sounds extreme, but that is literally what it feels like. Like something is drilling/boring thru me very slowly, all the time.

I have done UI's, X-rays, Ultrasounds, Blood tests, MRI's, EKG's, and damned if I can remember the rest. Lots of tests...but still no clue. Three out of four Dr's think I should be seeking the advice of an Orthopedic Surgeon as they are convinced it is muscular skeletal, but then again, that's why I had the MRI and it came up negative. So no idea, but will see in the next couple days what they find out at tomorrow's surgery.

I just want to go back to work. I like it there. I do well there. I don't stress there, nor do I have to face my rejection there on a 24/7 basis. That and I'm wierd in that I LIKE to work. I enjoy being a part of society, thank you very much.
