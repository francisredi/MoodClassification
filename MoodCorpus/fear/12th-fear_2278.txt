Meh
To start off on a happy note, today's my sister's birthday!!!! She's 14 now. Yay!

Now that I've taken care of that, here's the sucky stuff:

I'm pretty sure I hurt one of my friends. I didn't want to, and I didn't mean to, and I tried to avoid it, but they wanted something I didn't, and there was really no way around that. I feel completely awful right now. And I think I did the right thing, because it would have been worse to keep playing along and leading them on, but I honestly could not feel more horrible than I do at the moment. 

I tried to be nice about it, I really, really did. When they called me and asked me what the deal was, I told them that they were one of my really good friends, but I wasn't looking for the same things they were. I really tried to do it in a way that their feelings wouldn't get hurt. I guess I failed.

Because shortly thereafter, I got yelled at, cussed out, and hung up on. Which, as anyone that knows me realizes, made me completely freeze up, like I do anytime someone yells at me. I just have a hard time handling people screaming at me. What made me feel even worse after they hung up was the feeling that I deserved it, and the whole thing was my fault. Which it was, really. So basically, I sat on the floor in my closet for a half hour and cried.

Fortunately, the person then called Colin, who called me after he was finished talking to them, and he was awesome and nice and told me it wasn't my fault and helped me feel better. Which he does very well. But I'm still pretty nervous about seeing the person tomorrow at school. So eh.

Peace, love, and nervous breakdowns (almost) - I'm out.
