Hmm
Wow what a night, last night.  My FFIL got real sick all of a sudden, really dizzy and throwing up. It took my Other Half and his mom an hour and a half to get him from the bathroom to the bed (which is all of about 10 feet) because he was so very sick.  He was so dizzy that he was leaning his head against the wall, and if he moved it, he got worse.  We contemplated the emergency room but he finally calmed down enough to get some rest. Stayed up all night just in case. Today he's so ill he still needs my Other Half to hold him up to use the bathroom.  See, this is part of the dilemma of leaving them when we move away, in case something happens. At least my parents have my sis living in the same town - which is the only reason my dad is still alive today, because my sis was there when his aneurysm hit. If she hadn't gotten to him within those critical minutes, he'd either be a vegetable or dead right now.  It makes me rethink whether we should move 6 hours away from family.. but my problem is, I REALLY don't want to live in the area either of our parents are currently living.  Here, because of the hurricane problems, and there because of the crappy weather. *sigh*  Maybe when we do build our huge house, everyone can just come on over and hang out with us in OUR town...  I know I am supposed to expect these sorts of issues to increase as everyone gets older, I just want to be prepared for anything.
