hand....
surgery got pushed UP a week, to 2/15. THAT took some hoop-jumping, etc, but it's all set. Bear, bless her heart, was able to get that day off to take me over, wait, and bring home a drugged Scruff. I know I'm in good, capable hands, but I'm still scared. Left 3 emails and a voice mail for Larry to see if I can see him, had to call him and see if I can see him on 2/13.  MetLife and Gil and HR all cool with the surgery date change. It's at the same place I had the knee surgery, so I'm familiar with it. Wish I WASN'T, but I know it has to be done, as it's getting worse. Keeps going to sleep, the pain is phenomenal, and when I get the pins and needles feeling I know it's getting bad. I don't see being able to go to the choir workshop, but that's ok. We'll see. I'll ask Mary if she can bring me down that day.

What really scares me is I can't wear my collar into the surgery itself, but I know Bear will be there. I LOVE wearing my Bear collar, my PFLAG bracelet, etc, everywhere I can. My collar tells me that Bear is always with me, and who I answer to, who i belong to, and to who owns me. I'm gonna see if she can come in with me the whole time I'm in preop, and also have them let her know when I go to post op, so she can come in.
