up all night
i feel like i'm about to hit a wall.

i had a conversation earlier with a friend from work who is frustrated about his life.  he feels like he's all ready made too many mistakes and he doesn't know how to fix them.  i tried to be optimistic.  we're still young! there's so much more that could happen.  what's upsetting is that it seems a lot of the people I work with seem to be on the same road to potential nowhere. And it's not like they're losers, they're not stupid people, they just happen to have gotten sucked into the circuit city/mcc or no school at all life and don't know how to get out of it.

I need to get out of it.

What if I don't get into a school again?  I know it would be my own fault, and I know I've said it before, but I can't be a 4th year mcc student.  I guess I could just wait to worry until I see if I've gotten into a school, but I want to figure out a third option back up plan.  I want to go away to school so badly.  

Sometimes, I think that going to MCC was a good idea. I've learned a lot these past three years. But at the expense of what?  Being behind in school...and practically being behind in life....I either haven't gotten to the right step or skipped it over. Whichever it is, it's a missing step that needs to be found.

Life. I'm scared of who I'll become.
