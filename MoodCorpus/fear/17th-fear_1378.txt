ARGH!!!!
OK. im just annoyed with my parents, my father acts like an immature freak, it so anoying, he acts like a teenager, he had the nerve to say to me "dont tell you mother" after he vented a bunch of shit. so i have NO one to talk to. im so annoyed. i have been thinking for years that im the only reason my parents havent divorced. so today i cracked and i said to my mom that if i was the reason they were together, then just forget it. they dont need to stay married and a bunch of shit, i dont know what is going ot happen now. i hate this. but what ever, ill be out of the house in a year and a half, when im 18 or 2 years. its not too long. its fine i cant wait to move out. like its insane how much i wanna get the hell out of my house. i mean i love my parents, dont get me wrong, im just annoyed and im just not happy here. 

im scared shitless about the tryouts for the dobson dance team. im SOOOOOOO SO SO SO nervous. ahhhhhhhhh like its crazy how scared i am. im agitated and everything.
