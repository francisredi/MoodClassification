I was watching this show on the Discovery channel about a woman that weighs over 600lbs. With the help of her health aide and best friend she has the make a trip to other city to have gastric bypass surgery by the only doctor she could find that would perform the surgery on her. As I'm watching her aide and her friend 	literally push, pull, and lift her into the minivan her crying the entire time I felt my own eyes fill with tears. Tears for her and tears for myself. 

For her because I could only guess at the sadness and humiliation she must have felt while trying to get into this van and begging God to give her the strength to do it. 

For myself because this woman's situation is exactly what I fear. More than not being seen as beautiful, I fear waking up one morning even more trapped in my body than I am already. Waking up and realizing that I haven't left my house in over a year. And wondering how I let myself get there.

And when I realized all that, when I brought all those feelings to the surface... there was just no holding the tears from running down my face.
