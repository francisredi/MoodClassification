My knuckles have turned to white, there's no turning back tonight...kiss me one last time...
At this point, I am scared. I just got off the phone with my doctor, because my boss sent me home from work after I explained my symptoms...My doctor said this is serious enough that I absolutely need to go in to see them. If it gets any worse tonight, I am supposed to go directly to urgent care, no questions asked. I'm so scared, and I don't know what to do. I have my history final tomorrow, and I need to study so badly for it, but I can't focus on anything at all right now. I'm afraid this may be more serious than just simple little headaches...My mom is worried, my boss is worried, and yet they're all talking to me in that lets-not-tell-her-how-serious-this-is-tone. I hate doctors sometimes... Please...if you pray, pray for me. I'm sure that I'm over reacting right? Everything will be fine...I just need to lay down and rest.

I'll update tomorrow to tell you all how I am doing. Think good thoughts!
