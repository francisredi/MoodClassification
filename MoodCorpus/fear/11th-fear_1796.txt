Everyone I talk to now is talking about their future, my future. And never has the future seemed so imminent. I mean, I've known that soon I would need to decide what to do with my life, to apply to universities, go to university. And the going part was fine with me. The deciding part I had done. But the problem is, the closer it comes, the farther away it seems. It will take a lot of work to become a university professor, and people keep reminding me of that. Also, Sarah MacDonald recently got a $140 000 scholarship. That is a hell of a lot of money. And hearing that put so much pressure on me. It made me think, okay, I have to get more extracurriculars, more volunteer work, better grades. I need to excel and do as well as if not better than she. I'm not really sure why but I think it has something to do with that fact that I've always looked up to her, strived to do as well as she has. And I am so scared that I can't. A scholarship may be the only thing that will get me to university, especially if I don't get the internship at Weyerhauser like I hope to. The pressure's on, and I don't know if I can handle it. But saying that makes me think, everyone has done this before me, absolutely everyone. Why is it different from me? Because I have so much pressure, from myself, my parents, my teachers. All my life these people have been telling me I am so good, that I can succeed. But even if I succeed, will it be to the level they expect? I know it will be hard, and I know I will get through it. But maybe all these years they've been mistaken. Maybe I am just an average student. I don't think average will be nearly enough.
