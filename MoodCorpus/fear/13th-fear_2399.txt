I'm going to die tonight
I was driving home from work and my brakes gave out on the ice.&nbsp; I slid through a red light.After I'd been home for awhile, I heard someone trying to open my front door.&nbsp; If you didn't already know,&nbsp;I scare super easily.&nbsp;&nbsp;My roommates are on the opposite ends of the state this week.&nbsp; I frantically ran around the house and decided to hide in the basement.&nbsp; That way if I needed to, I could escape out the patio.&nbsp; After a couple hours, nothing happened, so I made my way back upstairs.About 30 minutes later, the fire alarm went off.&nbsp; The fire alarm is on the ceiling in the hallway, right above the stairs.&nbsp; I soon learned that standing on a chair with wheels, on the edge of stairs, fumbling around trying to get a fire alarm off the ceiling is a bad idea.&nbsp; Somehow I ended up at the bottom of the stairs, holding my leg in one hand, and the fire alarm in another.And now, I am typing this after pulling the carbon monoxide alarm off the wall, because it too, was going off.&nbsp; I reset it, and it stopped... so I'm hoping my house is safe and I'm not going to die tonight.&nbsp; Who knows.&nbsp; Maybe I'll die in my sleep.
