I have an interview tomorrow and I am NERVOUS!
So I have another job interview tomorrow, and this time it could be a seriously excellent oppertunity! I will be interviewing with the law firm Goldberg and Osborne, as an Administrative Assistant position that will directly assist one of the CEO's of the company, Mark Goldberg. Dude. This could be the job that starts it all for me... can you imagine having a name like his as a reference? It was explained as a postition on a team that will spend some of it's time in the office and some of the time working out of his home and assisting him with paperwork and so forth. Dream entry level job... could be. I just hope that it doesn't envolve weekends. Lawyers don't work on weekends, right? ;) Plus I have to pass a math, spelling, etc. test. And if you know me, you know math and I are mortal enemies... so I am a little terrified of the test.... ugh. So I am very nervous about my interview tomorrow!!!!!!!

So it is official, Mike and I will be staying the weekend at his house. It should be fun! We can break in his bed ;) Hehehe 

So wish me luck for tomorrow! I am hella nervous!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
