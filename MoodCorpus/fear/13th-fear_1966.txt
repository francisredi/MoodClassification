at this point my jaw dropped (shes volunteering to spend time with me after thursday?) and also, when she asked what i was doing tonight i said volunteering for orphins and putting out fires.  dead serious.  so we're going skating on ice that may or may not exist.  but itll be out.  thank goodness i have a mullet.  chicks dig that.  and now, if you'll excuse me, im stressed and nervous, and spontaniously taking up smoking for the stress, and bulemia so i fit in pants that wont trip me up on the ice.  im considering alcoholism, but im already dabbling in that and have been since 19 so taking it up isnt a really accurate term.  wish me luck, miracles, and whatever the muslim miracle is called, im gonna need that too.  maybe i just need larengitis.
