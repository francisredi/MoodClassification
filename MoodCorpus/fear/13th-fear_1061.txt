what's academia all about
I have been freaking out a bit here...the other night my view on academic institutions came into question. I see academics with twitches from pressure, have been told from a dear academic mentor of mine that chemical depression has been part of life for the past 10 years, and that there is no healing after six counselors and every antidepressant on the market. I hear that some academics are seriously psychically sick and unable to work and others like my friend are severely emotionally sick and unable to work and that I have experienced some other very strange behaviors towards me. So is this just a cross section of society at large or does all this intellectual stuff actually destroy people or severely impinge on their lives and spiritual health? When I met my supervisor and he kind of looked like he did not enjoy the essay that I was given a HD for - I thought...what does all this mean? How subjective is this caper? Is it because someone is smitten with me that I get a high mark or is it because of my academic performance. What does it all mean. My trust has been shaken to the core on this front. Do I want to be a twitchy, emotionally bankrupt, spiritually dead, narrowly focused individual? No, I don't. And I don't necessarily think academics are just these things either. I'm just seeing a lot of things that trouble me. So I won't be this way. I will learn for enjoyment, let go of competitiveness (which is rampant - what's your GPA?), value myself for more than my mind, and keep things in perspective. I think I put all my eggs in the achievement basket - and no it hasn't brought me happiness.
