I have a phobia of caterpillars.

Which are everywhere right now.  Initially I dislike the term "phobia" because that generally refers to a severe, irrational fear, however comma I do not necessarily fear the loathsome creatures so much as they completely, utterly, thoroughly, totally, all-encompassingly, in every regard repulse and disgust me.

Basically I hate the bastards.  

I hate that they are crawling all over my car, and staining it with their dead carcasses and their shit, and I hate that I had one on me earlier, in my own house no less!, and that I can't walk on campus without this indescribable and inescapable anxiety.

As I explained to my mother, Will and Paul earlier today: I believe I've discovered the source of my anxiety as of late, as well as the source of my panic attack (the combination of the migraine and my underlying anxiety due to the caterpillar phobia).

Oh, woe is me!
