That Ghost On The Tree
Somehow I have this horrible, horrible feeling that I'm not going to get into CofC, and I'll end up taking classes at Trident Tech while filling all of my spare time with work at a grocery store and copious amounts of alcohol to smother the pain of failure.

The good news is that the portion of my application for which the guidance office is responsible is on its merry way to the mailbox. The bad news is that I'm a well of fear.

1420 math + verbal with a perfect verbal and a 750 in writing, but no outstanding qualities and a 3.37 GPA. What does a 3.37 mete out to be? A "B" or thereabouts?

Must get freewriting poem in decent enough shape to turn into Cynie. O blargag.

I missed breakfast, and had a can of Mango Nectar (which really tastes just like eating a piece of mango) at about ten, but somehow I'm not hungry. Oh nerves, be damned.

Tonight = freewriting poem, finalize application stuff, any homework that shows up in pre-cal, laundry (?), kick roommate for fun, succumb to anxiety and depression.

Just kidding. I'm not going to kick Malia, she's been a sweetheart. She should eat this cake that Amber left us, though, because I'm not sure if I will and it's just going to sit here under its little plastic cover.

I smell like strawberry chapstick, Old Spice, rosemary shampoo, and (oh so faintly) the Vetruvian Man shirt that I slept in.

Our sink is dicked up to the point where I'm afraid to use it. Last night I brushed my teeth in the shower, and this morning I spit mouthwash into the toilet. Crest alcohol-free mouthwash tastes like ass, so that's probably an appropriate place for it.
