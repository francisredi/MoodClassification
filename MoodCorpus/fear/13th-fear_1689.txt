so nervous
I am SO nervous about my job interview tomorrow! I had job interviews, I hate talking about myself, and pretending to be interested, and I hate being so stupidly shy and not getting use to dealing with people. I wish I could be all calm about stuff but instead I feel like I'm going to be sick. Brilliant and the interview isn't until tomorrow morning. I don't know why it feels like I'm going to die or something, I am all panicing, I haven't had one of these little panic attacks in a few months, and I sort of forgot what it's like,everything is highened and I feel like I'm going to die or something, and yet I know rationally there is nothing wrong with me. Well I am going to try and enjoy today and not think about the interview, but of course the harder I try to do that the harder it will be not to think about it. Hmmm...tomorrow it will be over and I will be okay and then a week from monday is france so I will focus on france and not worry, or at least try to!
