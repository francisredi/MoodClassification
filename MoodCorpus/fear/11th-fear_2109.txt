Menace's medical melodramas
Well, his bloodtests came back as relatively normal, apparently. Which is, I suppose a good sign. However, what this means is the next step is to take the pooch to a neurologist, which is going to be bloody expensive, and could mean a rather big operation - they think there is a problem with his spine that is causing him to lose control of his bowels. Poor Menace.

So, going to be doing some negotiating with his health fund (yup, I have Accident and Illness insurance on him for just these situations) and see if they can pay for things up front with me paying the excess, rather than me paying up front and them reimbursing me. I've checked into the rough average cost of the operation the vet expects Menace will require, and it's around $3000. If I can't get the fund to pay the bulk of it, then Menace will be waiting months for the surgery. Depends on how much pain he is in (and from the way he was blissfully chasing a ball around the house and antagonising possums most of the night, it can't be too much), and whether the other symptoms are worsening. 

He's 9 years old in April, and the vet has suggested that the operation may be too much for him anyway - since she reckons he nearly worked himself into a heart attack through stress at the appointment on the weekend. But spinal surgery would not help with the current obsession he has of chewing holes in his legs. Which is getting worse, and more frequent, and has only started happening in the past year, in which he's done both front legs (the right front 3 times), and one back leg. He's always been an obsessive, anxious animal, and its just getting worse as he ages.

I know, if it comes down to a quality of life issue, that I'm gonna have to let him go and have the vet put him to sleep, but the thought of that is just ... it's awful to contemplate. I've had him since he was about 8 weeks old, effectively he's my baby - since I don't have kids or anything.
