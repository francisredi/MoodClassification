scared as life moves on
As most people do they invision how they want their lives to turn out. We all want things to go perfectly without having to make sacrifices, but if we didn't have to make sacrifices then it would be boring, there would be no thrill as to what will happen next. I'm in the 4th quarter of my junior year, and all this talk about getting my senior year ready and beginning to search for the right college and major to go into is starting to worry me. I'm afraid that things aren't going to turn out the way I want them. I might choose a major that will end up being the wrong one for me. I might not choose the right college. The people I love the most may not be with me after this year. The lifestyle i've gotten so accustomed to may be gone. As life moves on it scares me because it's just going way too fast. I remember when the only thing i had to worry about was getting dressed, now as i get older more and more responsibility is being put on me. This isn't really the part that worries me because I'm mature enough to handle it. I just don't want to make a mistake of ruining my life or anyone else that i care the most for. I just wish i knew the choices i'm making now are the right ones. I pray to God all the time to lead on the right path, but only through experience will i know whether i followed him or not.
