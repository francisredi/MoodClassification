Hey You
I just finished my last undergraduate class.  Well that's sort of a lie for two reasons: 1)I still have one more essay to write for another class and 2)I'm considering doing another degree next year so yea...I'm insane.  Still if I do come back next year I don't think I'll really feel like I'm still in Undergrad...but time will tell.  It feels strange to have gone by so quickly, and somehow I feel like I should have learned more, that I should have studied harder, been more driven. And yet I don't really feel like I wasted my time either.  

Next up is to find a summer job which is making me rather nervous.  At home I knew where to look, where was a good place to apply, etc, and if I didn't find something right away I was still living with my parents so at least I had food and shelter.  This summer will be much different.  I'm both excited and terrified.  I'm really tempted to get a job in retail.  That's one job I've always wanted to work for some odd twisted reason...so now might be the time.  Who knows.  Time will tell.

And now I'm off to write my final essay and hopefully get something done before I have to go to work.  Sigh!
