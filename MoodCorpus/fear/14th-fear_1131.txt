I am scared. I don't know why, cuz I know I can do this. I can leave. but what it I can't. What if I don't get accepted, what if I do? I am seriously scared. I am losig control really quickly. I can't sleep, and I haven't been really able to eat either without wanting to throw up. I am just so nervous. What if I get in but I can't do the work. What if I flunk out? What if I find a way to screw it all up. I'll get in trouble I'll not think before I do something and I will get kicked out. I'll have to come home and go to ICC cuz they won't let my back into school. Something will happen that will make this not work out. I have been here too many times before when I finallly get the chance of my dreams but something always messes it up. Will I be able to say goodbye again? I'm not sure I can. I don't know if I am ready to do this. But I want to so badly. I want this I am just scared. I mean it's college. I am only fifteen and I applied to college. It's strange I am happy and anxious. I want to go. I just can't help but think about all the things that can happen that will ruin my chances. I mean am I really willing to give up seening my friends, missing my prom, and high school graduation, or miss out on seeing all that stuff for you guys. If I go to this place I will only be able to come home during christmas and summer. I don't say goodbye again. When I thought I was just transfering schools it was not really a big deal cuz I would be able to see you all still, but I would moving to MA. That is far away, and I won't be able to see anybody. I am just scared and tired. With how fast things are going right now what if I won't be able to catch it? What if I just lose my grip on life? What if I fall behind? What if I crash? Can I handle that?
