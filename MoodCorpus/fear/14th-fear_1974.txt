Surgery
I met with the surgeon today. He seems alright. He talked to me about the surgery and some of the complications of it. The thyroid is right on the nerve that moves your vocal cords, and 1% of the time with this surgery, that can be damaged and you'll have a hoarse voice forever. Not gonna happen though. And 5% of the time, the parathyroid glands are damaged which means I'll have to take calcium supplements three times a day forever. Not fun. Better not happen. So we just talked about that, and I went ahead and scheduled the surgery for August 17. I get back from England on August 15 and have to be at Shands on August 16 for a pre-op. Which means... after my nine hour flight back, I have to drive an hour and a half home to West Palm from Miami, pack, then drive four hours up here to Gainesville. That's a lot of traveling to do in one day. I'm going to be extremely jet lagged. Ugh. But that's the best time to do the surgery, because I'll have almost a week to recover before classes start. And the doctor also told me that I have a hypothyroid. Which means I have to start taking the hormone replacement now. That just makes the decision to go ahead with the surgery easier, because I have to take the replacement either way. I'm a little nervous about the surgery... I've never had surgery before. I haven't been admitted to a hospital since my very first Christmas when I had the flu. But I'm sure everything will go ok. If not, I'm going to have the best summer ever before I die!! lol. j/k about the dying. lol.
