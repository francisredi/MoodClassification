Nightmares
I need to feel normal.

Do you ever have nightmares? Hindi yun type na you dream of something bad like being embarassed in front of your crush or being chased by some mad killer or losing your teeth blah blah blah.

Yung you're half awake and you hear the TV blaring then you feel something grabbing you and then suddenly wala ka ng control sa katawan mo and you try to scream but nothing comes out. You know your eyes are closed, but you can see everything and basta try ka lang ng try gumalaw until eventually, with your heart beating very rapidly, you snap out of it.

This happened to me twice my first three years of college. The thing is, ngayong senior year second sem, I've been experiencing it quite often. Last December, twice a night and twice this morning.

I'm horrified coz for the first time, I heard voices. "Bro, tulungan mo ako." Putangina. When I woke up, I cried out of fright.

Patrick's the only person who can relate to me. Wala na akong kilalang iba. Oh Lord, I'm so scared. What's wrong with me?
