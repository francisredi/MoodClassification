GUESS WHAT!
This Wednesday is my last day of work for 2 whole weeks which means that I will have time to work on all my school work without the stress of my job interfering. Statistics has been HARD lately... I've been struggling all weekend to study for my exam tommrow. I've figured out that if I get a 60 (F) on this exam, and another 60 on the next one, I can pass the course with a C. 

Which is FINE with me. I just want to pass. 

Its like I understand the processes, but theres so many of them that I'm very afraid on the exam I'm going to forget. :/ I'm nervous about it. I keep studying before I go to sleep, studying the second I wake up, then studying for a few hours during the day... and its still hard. I'm scared I wont know what to do. So I'm hoping that once work is over, I'll have extra time to sit there an absorb everything, go for extra help if I need it, etc.

It will be nice to have a break and be able to concentrate on my studies entirely for once.

Wish me luck...
