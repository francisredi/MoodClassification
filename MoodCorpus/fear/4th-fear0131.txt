You know I'm such a pear sometimes
I feel compelled to make an entry concerning what is happening about 8 miles from my home away from home.

If you don't know what I'm talking about, hit up http://www.cnn.com . You'll find out right quick.

My thoughts, prayers, best wishes, and heart go out to those people. We, as West Virginians, stand united. More united than any other state in this Union, I think. We all know how dangerous the mining industry can be. We all feel the pain of a fellow West Virginian, especially in events like this. I'm fully convinced that it's not just Gov. Manchin and about 250 people in that church awaiting word on the Sago 13. It's the entire state. I know there's a game in Atlanta that's captured our attentions as well, but we all feel this deep in our hearts. We all feel the anxiety and the fear, but we also feel the hope. We'll stand tall together and show the country that we're just as strong a state as when Abe Lincoln signed us into existence, when the mines would blow up and the widows would go to the shaft to try and pick the bones of their beloved out of the rubble, when the federal government bombed us for fighting for our rights. Montani Semper Liberi.

By the way, props to Gov. Manchin. He's where he needs to be-- right there with his people in the fray.
