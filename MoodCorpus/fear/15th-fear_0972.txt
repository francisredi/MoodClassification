3 libras and insomnia
so i have been trying to go to sleep for over an hour now and its just not working. there is so much going on in my head right now and i don't know how to sort any of it out. (i realize this must be entirely true because of the speed at which i am typing, which is in fact amazing). i don't want to leave atlanta, it is my home. but i have to do it. i have to go. i have to go so i realize what it is i lose not being here. i have to go so i can get my life back on track. i have to go because there are some complications here that only my husband knows entirely about. i feel so alone. i miss having really close friends who would just listen to me be retarded for hours on end if necessary, but i am not ashamed or sorry for anything that lost me those friends. i was not wrong in what i said, and certainly not wrong in how i felt. i need to talk to my boss about moving. i am really scared of having to drive all the way to atlanta by myself considering i have never driven for more than an hour straight. i need a massage, my shoulders and neck hurt and have for like a month. its no good. *sigh* i just don't know. i really just don't know. i have a lot of packing to do. i should probably do that instead of sitting here and typing something no one will ever read, but this makes me feel better and that won't. 

its time to let go.
time to let go.
let go.
go.
