*panic*
I am having the worst panic attack I have ever had in my life.  I am completely freaked out and scared beyond belief.  I want to go hide in a corner and not come back out.  I am experiencing all the worst of all my symptoms ever - except for the suicidal urges but I'm sure if I stuck with this too long I'd go right back there too.  I'm having the damn hardest time staying in my body right now.  I feel like I have some variant of ADD.  I can't concentrate on anything for very long on anything and I keep forgetting steps in things I'm trying to do.  I'm facing so many of my old fears right now that it's hard to try to do anything.  I feel completely frozen to my seat.  Afraid to move an inch left right or sideways.  So much of this I've been dealing with so well up until today.  Now its like all of my protections and defences are gone.  I'm one large raw nerve facing some all too real memories from 16 years ago and being just as scared now as I was then.  I'm just amazed at how completely freaked out I am right now.

The good news is that I just talked to my doctor and she says this should have completely filtered out of my system by some point tomorrow, but that there isn't really anything I can do to hasten it's departure.

I'm happy there's a massive hope for a much better tomorrow because I'm feeling pretty hopeless right now.
