I'm so fucking afraid of my guitar. Yes, yes, that's right my friends. I'm afraid of a fucking inanimate object that can't even kill me unless it is thrown at me or something. I just realized today that I haven't played it since I came back from dad's house. It's still in its cloth case thingy. and honestly, I like it being in there. It makes me feel protected from it actually. Dunno why it scares me in the first place though but w/e.

Okay that's a lie. I know exactly why it scares me. Cuz it holds me back from my dream, and if I can't play guitar I can't achieve that dream. So I'm afraid of learning that I can't play guitar for shit, and I hate it cuz I NEED it. I need it to be able to write songs, and as you might now, I hate needing things. I've always been independent. seriously, since the day I was born, I've never wanted anyone else's help. I saw this home movie video type thing a while ago from when I was like 1, and I was first being fed solid food, and my mom is feeding me with a spoon and as soon as she puts it down, I grab it like "I don't need your help, I can do it. let me do it! I don't need you! let me do it.". thus creating my guitar phobia. 

Anyway, I have to sleep. g'night.
