So I just got home from Ottawa about 2 hours ago. One of the first things I go do is say hello to the hamster. Boo was quite asleep, so I let him be for a while, but he did get up about an hour ago, so I took him out. And discovered a huge, red, really ugly mass on his side. Like, larger than a pencil eraser, and this is on a HAMSTER. It's ginormous. He seems to be moving okay, and Chris said he didn't act any different while I was gone... the more I htink about it though, the more I seem to recall feeling a little lump on that side before I went home, so around New Year's. I thought I was just feeling some food in his cheek pouch, but now I don't know. It might be cancer, or an abscess, or a skin infection, or a chunk of something stuck in his cheek pouch that's festering. But I'm very worried. I work late tomorrow, so we can't even take him to the vet until Friday afternoon, and that's assuming that we find a vet who knows about hamsters.
