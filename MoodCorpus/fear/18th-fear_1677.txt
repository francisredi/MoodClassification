am i insane?
I don't know what it is about Nicolas but i trust him, not because i had a crush on him, but because of, i don't know really, i just do, we spent Tuesday laying out on one of the university lawns just talking and Thursday night until 1am at his apartment, just chatting and laughing and being silly, its nice to , and it was about everything, the rumours that we're dating, There are things i told him  that he could totally crush me with, in hindsight, i probably shouldn't have, but i don't really regret it.

So we know things about each other that neither of us have talked about for ages. fears, suicide attempts; he did take a look at my poetry, which i wasn't ready for,  i thought i was gonna cry/throw up/die when he did, we were talking about it, and he grabbed the notebook i keep it in and read one. wow mega scary, but its ok, i'm ok. he hasn't been in the apartment yet, i'm kinda scared to have him here. i don't know. I'm weird

Huge Norwegian exam on Tuesday wish me luck/death/divine intervention.
