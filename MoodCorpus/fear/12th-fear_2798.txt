ever had one of these dreams?
I woke up in the coldest sweat to date.  I was hysterical crying and shaking.  I had a terribly horrific dream that my mother died and it felt so real and empty.  It wasn't a sensational dream in the way of violence or anything.  I didn't see her die in the dream or how she died...it just opened up at her funeral and then the post funeral stuff.  I just remember feeling sad that I wouldn't get to talk to her anymore, or hug her, or see her.  I remember realizing that my sister and I were so young...not out of college, or married with families or anything yet.  I remember thinking how weird it was going to be with just my father around.  I also remember thinking how much nicer and kinder I could have been to her throughout my life.  It scared THE SHIT OUT OF ME.  It's the first time since I was a little girl that I woke up in tears...violent tears.  I ran downstairs in my socks and X-tra large T-shirt and threw my arms around her.  She was shaken by it.  She promised she'd quit smoking finally...I hope that she meant it...becuase I really truely need her.  It may be selfish but its true...I love her and I need her and this dream scared me so much I'm truly dreading closing my eyes again tonight.  I've never felt that empty in my life...
