The Time Has Come
Well yesterday was so nice. Ash came home from work really early and gave me roses which I loved. Then we hung out with Frank for a bit. The landlord came over with our fixed dishwasher. At around 6 we left for dinner at this really neat restaraunt called Solos. There is a part of the restaraunt that you can eat on an old war plane. Dinner was awesome:) Then we came home and watched House and Law and Order.

So I'm a nervous wreck about packing. I'm also nervous about getting home. I'm nervous about meeting Ash's friends. I'm nervous about everything. He's knows about this and keeps telling me not to be so damn nervous. I'm nervous that he won't like the school in new york. I'll be pretty screwed if he doesn't. That means he might end up in Florida...and I can't go...I can't be that far away...I can't financially do it. I am barely able to do this. But he keeps telling me not to be such a Debbie Downer..hehe. 

So I need some positive thoughts from all of you...bring em on..I need some:)
