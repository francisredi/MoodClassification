Sam the Spider Hunter
I was watching tv on the couch, waiting for the torrent of the new Veronica Mars episode to be uploaded, when I decided I needed to use the washroom. I walked over, opened the door, and let out a shriek of horror. You see, sitting on the floor was the biggest freaking spider I have ever seen. Its legs included, it was the size of a tealight candle. Yeah, I pretty much lost it. My mom was really mad because apparently I "woke her from a dead sleep." Hello, my life was in danger. I could see the hairs on that little bugger's legs! It probably had venom in it. 

Sam came upstairs, and so I begged him to get rid of it. By this time, the spider had crawled behind the toilet, so poor Sam, armed with his shot glass, had to crawl around to catch it. He did catch it (thank god). Just to be sure, he had me watch as he flushed it down the toilet (I have trust issues - I once asked him to kill a ladybug that was in my room, and he lied and told me he had killed it, but when I went back to bed the ladybug landed on my face). Anyway, I think we have slain the mother, but I'm afraid its minions will be out for revenge - I've been finding spiders all over the place all week. Where are they coming from?!
