I've had the email sitting there for almost a week. After applying and applying at every damn online loan place I can find only one emailed me back with an offer. Or at least, i think (hope) it's an offer. Actually it's just a phone number to call the local branch and discuss the loan. 

I'm absolutely terrorfied of getting the loan. If I do that means I have to take the next step on this whole going back to college thing, and that just unnerves me. I'm afraid that I won't be able to handle it, that I won't be able to make it, that I'll crash and burn again. But this time with two little ones to watch me fall. What would I do then?

And what if I succeed? Go to school and do nothing with it? As much as my heart skips a beat at the thought of staying home all day and homeschooling, I know that money will be too tight for that. And honestly, I doubt that I have the patience to do it full time. Last night I looked at some good private schools, mostly Montessori. We'd have to move, but Michael is on the edge of needing to leave this dump anyway. Could I send my babies away to school all day while I worked? It feels like a no-win situation. I know I couldn't be home all day with the kids, but I don't want to ship them off 8 hours a day to someone else. So what do I do? 

It will take me 2-3 years to get my associates by my plan, add on more time if/when I go back to get my bachelor.
