i feel like i'm being pulled in a million directions at once
just talked to rob on AIM for a bit. 

i'm crying now. but not cuz of him. cuz of me.

working at the maids has been a very big challenge for me. not only is it stressful to deal with the crap at work, but i tend to bottle up my emotions in my life outside work. i retreat to my room to type useless crap on my computer. and my only companion in here is a teddy bear. occasionally two. 

i dont ever allow any time for myself. i sleep away a lot of my spare time because i'm exhausted. 

lately i've been feeling overwhelmed with thoughts and feelings. a lot of anxiety and fear. 


how does one get out of an abusive relationship with themself? i beat myself up for everything i do.


everytime i think i'm moving forward and feeling healthier and happier, it seems i take 20 steps backward. 


i'm too tired and upset to write any more.
