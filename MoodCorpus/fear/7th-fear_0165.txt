So, I have this interview tomorrow with the Nantucket Conservation Foundation tomorrow that I am really excited and nervous about! It's for a vegetation monitoring and research intern. I know I shouldn't be nervous, at least less nervous than if it were a phone interview because I come across much better in person but... I CAN'T HELP IT!! Selling yourself is so awkward sometimes, and this job would be really, really neat. According to my mom, whether I get the job or not is likely to be a function of who else applies which I suppose is true. I am qualified, it just depends if someone MORE qualified, or more familiar with Nantucket wants the job too. Wish me luck!

, I love you so much but you already know that. Take care of yourself. (I also have Fall Out Boy in my head... someone kill me it's starting to grow on me)

Back to my 10 page treatsie on habitat fragmentation and the effectiveness of biological corridors. I'm trying to think of a catchy title.
