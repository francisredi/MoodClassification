it's almost time...
so does anyone else ever get really depressed about everything and nothing at the same time? i'm totally scared of this summer--scared that it will suck balls. i hated working at NIH so much last summer and the only thing that got me through was coming home to see my friends: Youssef, Jason, Jesse, Kara, Brandy. Now I will come home to nothing, no one, and I couldn't be more terrified.  I am a people person--I need to be around people to feel happy.  That's why I never live at home because I'm all alone with my parents.  Living at Walker (and my friends) was the only thing that got me through last summer.  Will I make this summer?  I don't know.  But on the plus side, I will have a pool and possibly a dog.I don't know why but I feel like I'm just on the brink of losing my foundation.  I feel like everyone around me is growing up and I wanted to grow up too just to be with my friends but now I'm really wishing it weren't happening.  I want last summer back, even though my LJ posts were totally lame and depressing.  Retrospect really is 20/20 because all I want is the good summer I had last year.  I don't want to move off campus and I don't want anyone else to either.  But we all are and that's sad.  I feel like living off campus will be like living at home only more expensive--I will still feel alone all the time.  I'm so terrified I could cry.  I'm in too deep and there's no turning back now.  For the next year my ass is grass.you know that i would love to see you next yeari hope that i am still alive next year
