Holy Crap I am between going insane and going home. I want to go home sooo bad this weekend but I know I can't cause I don't have any money to go home. Grr. 

I wrote one of my papers already and I have one left to write about Plastic Surgery and how it has become much more accepted these years (Pop culture). How fun!

I went to work today, I was ecxcited to go all week but I got there and it was BORING! I even left 50 mins early cause we had like NO customers. Oh well.

Easter is next weekend and I am so stoked to go home again. I cannot wait, only 10 more days of school left. Not including weekends. I AM SO HAPPY! I am really worried my mobil home isn't going to sell, I need it to sell before I move at the end of April. I am so worried its not going to happen! I just want it to go right.

I want to move home this summer, start my job at the bed and breakfast, enjoy my life again. I want to see my friends and see Shaun every weekend. I am so anxious.
