I wish to make a pact with thee
today was alright. now a days we have been on block schedule and probably will be on that for awhile...
nothing really happened to me today.... in first period we had to watch "dante's peak" and take notes on it so we can make a presentation on how it relates to real-life science. then in art we painted a value scale and oh boy did it get messy. then finally in third i got crazy...
right now i'm feeling a little insecure.. wondering about what people think of me in third period because my ex keeps bugging me and acts as if i'm still all good with him. I HATE THAT!!! KOGA(As i call him) IS A CHEATING, LYING, BASTARD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
but yes i do wonder what they think of me.. if they think i'm wierd or if think i like koga(ew). a long time ago lupe, a girl in my class, noticed my pictures of inuyasha and we talked about it... we haven't spoken in awhile considering that her friend brittany is telling her to stay away from me and brittany is talking shit about me. i wonder though if lupe still likes anime... and if she wants to be my friend... i'm so scared to ask.
i don't know what to do!!! omg why do i have to be so shy!! damnit!!!!
