I've still got a lot of leavin left to do...
Today felt like friday which is pretty unfortunate because i still have one more day of the week to go. It wasn't that horrible in school today tho. I got out early to go get my injection for my bone scan. Pretty cool. The actual scan is 7pm tonight. I am not nervous for the actual test but i am nervous for the results. I'm pretty confident that it will show something tho... so im not that worried.Kelsey Marie Glynn needs a livejournal no matter what she says!On monday afterschool there is a concentration camp survivor coming in to speak about his experience during the holocaust. I'm so incredibly.... excited for this.&nbsp;I don't know that excited is the right word because i'm sure the presentation will be eye-opening and horrific, but its a once in a lifetime opportunity and i'm glad i have the chance. I think it will be so interesting to find out what happened and how someone got thru it all....LOST last night was the most amazing episode that series has ever seen. I just felt like i needed to shout that&nbsp;out.
I also feel the need to shout out how much a shweenie/michelle munster reunion is totally necessary ASAP! gosh! I miss my shween so much, and online talking just doesnt equal an all nighter and/or walk on the pier type of convo. AHHHH I CAN'T WAIT FOR PORT AUSTIN!!!!!! =)Okay thats it.Homework time.&lt;3 MAR
