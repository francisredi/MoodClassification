Nose Stud in Peril
It was a very harrowing evening as I stood by the sink trying tp shove the cheap plastic retainer through the manmade hole in my nose.  Taylor stood by bearing the brunt of my grump until he suddenly left and returned with a collection of various lubes. ( I thought that was too funny to tastefully exclude, sorry.)  Even so, my stubborn poking was gaining me nothing but a sore and suddenly bleeding nose.    This unhappy predicament had come about because I had mistakenly assumed that a bit of fishing line tied through my nose would do for a retainer in a rush-to-Taylor's-house-forget-everything pinch.  I was wrong.  Which was why an anxious run to the piercing parlor was in order.  It was painful.  It isn't subtle.  But I have a new nose stud in my recently rewidened hole.  The didn't have any retainers on hand so I'm just going to try and hide the sparkle and avoid my boss for now.

I'm so relieved that I'm repoked.  I was so scared that crappy Knetchs autoparts had successfully sucked my soul forevermore. 

Bort has now has some flea meds.  So whatever it is, it isn't her fault.
