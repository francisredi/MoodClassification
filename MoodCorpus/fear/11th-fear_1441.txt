Maybe we'll get lucky and we'll both grow old
My dad is having bypass heart surgery next Thursday. They have to open his ribcage. Part of me has been freaking out for the past 8 hours, while the other part watched two movies, went to latenight, talked to people. Now I'm back in my room and the freaking out part is winning a little bit. Or a lot of bit.

I know it's routine, I know it's not a huge deal, but...his ribcage. Jesus christ. I can't handle this. I don't do these things well. I clam up and stay silent on the phone and then cry in an stairwell. I don't have a reasonable mind, so reason doesn't work. I'm just standing here trying not to imagine my dad on an operating table, trying not to see it in my mind like a memory even though it hasn't happened yet.

It's just like how I hate the (completely safe) railing of our loft because i always think Terry's going to fall. Or when my mom is late coming home and my head works to tell me all the awful reasons why, so I sit alone at the kitchen table and watch the clock. Or when the paramedics are in our living room and I'm holding Cooper in my parents' room and I listen so hard for that high note of panic in their voices, terrified of the words, "I think we're gonna take him in to be safe," because that's not what they mean.

And one of these days my stupid head is going to be right, and what then?

Ribcage. Fuck.



And now i need to calm down. Sorry. I'm using this as a freak-out outlet. Calming down now, going to sleep.
