discovering the waterfront.
tryouts = two days from now.think i'm nervous? oh yes i am.my jumps are better than before.but my hurkey's absolutely suck.i'm just so nervous.i probably shouldn't be..but still.i went babysitting tonight.quite an adventure. haha.i fucking hate north adams.it's so gay.there's way too much drama.and nobody knows when enough is enough.there comes a certain point where it's just like c'monn..but you know, nobody ever gets it.it's just one of those things that people absolutely ADORE.i think some get joy of making others guilty over shit that's not even their fault.-hint-i'm so fucking sick of like..everything.school at CMS is miserable and irritating.along with the teachers and students, or your supposed "friends."i wish i could have my uncle to talk too.but i don't..so i don't know.summer's coming.could be good or it could be bad.it will probably be bad..considering that's just the kinda shit that happens to me.
