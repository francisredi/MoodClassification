yesterday i tore something in my ankle/foot.  i hate crutches, i hate tendonitis, and i hate this dependency.  it is all bruised and swollen and ugly, and i am scared.  i hate not knowing what is wrong...maybe i will be fine tomorrow.  i do not remember most of the past two days.  there are things i know must have happened, but i do not recall them at all.  also: pain killers might be making me more sad that i already am.  however, without them, i throw up, i think because this pain gets me worked up/upsets my stomach.  i cried all through dinner and most of the evening.  i am dumb for typing all this for the entire world wide web to see.
despite a new notebook, my writing is going down the toilet.
tomorrow is the second "anniversary."  we are going to four sons for dinner (in t-vegas).  i hope i do not ruin things.
i do not want to be an angry person, but i am afraid i am...  maybe the summer will clear my head.
