I'm back from my last day at work.  It was bittersweet, really.  I'm going to miss a few of the people I worked with since I really did like them a lot.  I'm sure a couple of them will still be there at the end of the summer when I come back, so I'll have to stop in and say hi.  Aline is threatening to call me to come back in and train someone new since she doesn't want Cindy doing it.  I take that as a compliment, but I hope she doesn't call.  I don't mind training, but I would like today to really be my last day.  Maybe they will just call and ask questions.  I discovered today that I was supposed to have a background check before I started this job, but they forgot to do it.  Oh well.  Good thing to find out on my last day.  Lucky for them I'm not a hardened criminal.  Ha.  
Things are wrapping up around here and I'm trying to get ready to leave.  Packing isn't going to be that hard, but packing up Matt's place sounds intimidating, so I'm going to put it off for a couple more days.  I'm a little scared at what I might find living in the piles.  The dress fiasco worked itself out and I don't have to pay for any of the alterations or extra fabric, so that is a relief.  It took a couple times on the phone with the manager and much confusion on her part, but she finally figured it out and took responsibility for fixing it.  So now I feel kind of between projects and very unmotivated.  I'm getting more nervous as June creeps closer, but I feel stuck on a lot of this until I get home.  Then once I get home time is going to fly and I'm afraid that some things won't get done.  It's a conundrum to be sure.
