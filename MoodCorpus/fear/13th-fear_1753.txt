I  swear my paranoia will kill me one day. Or save me from a murderer. 

Well, today&nbsp;I was going home from&nbsp;Ian's, and I got the lovely number 10. So,&nbsp;like, I got on the bus and there were no seats.&nbsp;S
o&nbsp;I sat next to this guy, who was like, 30 or something, and I was thinking, God, I hate people! I wish I didn't have to sit next to one! However, I had no fucking choice, so I sat there, perfectly still, and&nbsp;deliberatly stared the other way.&nbsp;After two minutes I could see him out&nbsp;of the corner of my eye, looking&nbsp;at me, and I was absolutely shitting myself, sat so still, all muscles tensed so much they were hurting,&nbsp;and for some reason this little voice came into my head and said:Stop being so paranoid, animals can smell fear! And then Alice's laugh got into my head, the kind where she would throw her head back, 'HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!' So I started smirking like I always do. So, at this point, I'm sat next to a creepy perv, with my muscles all tensed, practically sweating with fear on the ice cold bus, smirking.Then he talked to me. What the fuck? I'm like, shit, shit shit.Him: 'Hello.'&nbsp;Me:&nbsp;&nbsp; *Turns, smiles, looks away and thinks* 'AHHHHH!'Him: 'You're quiet.'Me:&nbsp; *Some forced grimace and laugh* 'Thanks.'Him: 'What's your name?'Me:&nbsp;&nbsp; *Fucking leave me alone!!!* 'Mel.'Him: 'I'm blah blah.'Ugh, and then he shook my hand. A stranger invading my personal space, talking to me, then touching me? Weirdo.Thankfully, the bus got to my stop and I was like 'ohwellthisismystopnowgottagobye' and ran to the front of the bus, running over some guy's foot in the process. I then ran off the bus and nearly got run over in my haste to get away. I then checked behind me all the way home, and listented for footsteps.
For some people, a tale like that is not even woth telling. For me, it is my worst Nightmare.
