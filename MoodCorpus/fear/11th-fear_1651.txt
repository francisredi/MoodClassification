The products of a long Saturday with not much to do
I went to help with the mass costuming day for a while today, but I did very little. I don't think Mr. Kelly likes me very much anymore, but that's okay with me. I pulled out of a costuming job for the next LT show because I can't stand him anymore. I've had enough of his condescending crap. I'm still enjoying Chicago because I have a lot of friends in it, and I like spending time with them when I otherwise would not see them. 

Anyway, I think the big reason he really liked me last year was because my only activity was the musical; this year I've had other stuff and he hates it when people who work with him have other commitments. I've almost stopped caring. 

I've been half pining, half pondering, too. I want a boyfriend. I've wanted one for a long time. I haven't gone out with anyone in almost two years. But then I think about it more, and honestly, I don't know if I can handle having a boyfriend. I'm obsessive, I read way too much into things, and I'm insecure. I'm not beating myself up by saying that, it's just the truth. I was probably like that with the couple of guys I've gone out with before, and I'll probably be like that with any guy in the future. I haven't changed, I know that. 

People say that college changes people. It's looming ahead of me. While I am frustrated with high school at the moment, I'm so scared of going to college. There's going to be parties, and drinking, and drugs. I don't want to get into that. Ever. I don't want to drink in college, and I don't want to ever do any kind of drug. I was talking to this guy in my War in Lit class yesterday about what it's like being high or drunk, and neither appeal to me. But it's going to be all around me at UW-Madison. Sometimes I don't trust the strength of my willpower. I'm afraid.
