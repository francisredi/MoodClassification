designers, up until now you've all fucking sucked. but go out now there and kick butt!
I will not spaz about grad school. I will not spaz about grad school. I will not spaz about grad school. *deep breath*

Ugh. All afternoon I've been vacillating between "You know, I don't think I really want to go to grad school after all. Why did I waste all this money applying?" and "Omigod I'm not going to get in anywhere and I'm going to have a nervous breakdown and become a drug addict like that guy on Intervention who got rejected from all the law schools he applied to and then got addicted to meth."

I'm happy I made the decision to tell everyone who asks that my first choice is "wherever accepts me and gives me money." So I can just say about every school that rejects me, "Well, I never actually wanted to go there anyway." (Full disclosure: I don't really want to go to Iowa or Arizona. Any of the other seven places I'd be quite content with.)

Need to stop reading . It's freaking me out. I'm jealous of every single person who's already heard from one or more of their schools. I just want to hear from one place. At this point I'd dance naked in the street if I got into Iowa, of all places.

Or not. 'Cause nobody wants to see that.
