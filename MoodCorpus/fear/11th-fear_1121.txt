the universe is trying to tell me something. 
tonight i went out with nikki and angela and lisa from work...we went to brennan's for dinner and the to the brewpub afterwards for drinks and whatnot. 

however, i think i am in grave danger. my life is like "final destination" all of a sudden. and i should know, i sat through two of those godforsaken movies. fool me once, shame on me, final destination. still, it was freaky.

on wehrle near prior aviation, lisa and i were just chatting when a deer bolted out in front of the car. i was driving, so i hit the brakes and it ran by us. but the car going the other way in the next lane HIT IT. and i mean, i heard bones crunching. it was just AWFUL. i had never been around anything like that before. 

then at dinner, we were eating and sharing a bottle of wine when nikki started feeling dizzy. we thought she was just getting buzzed so we laughed it off, but then all of a sudden she got a terrible nosebleed. i've only ever had one before, and they make me NERVOUS. 

and then at the brewpub i was outside with lisa while she was having a cigarette and these guys in suits came over to us and started chatting about their plans for the evening. they decided to go to infinity, blech. and then when there was only one left, he yelled after his friends "hey, i'm going to tell these girls about the time you broke your dick! didn't think that that was possible, did you ladies?" and then he fell over as he was walking over to the car.

so all these bad things have happened to people near me tonight...i wonder if i shouldn't stay inside tomorrow. at least the beer was good.
