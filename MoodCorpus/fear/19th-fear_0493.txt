My mother is the most healthiest dying person ever.. Or so says dad. Goddamn it life just isn't fair. I Love my mommy so much and I hate to see her the way she is. We only have a few more days.. Maybe even hours. My brother is here, everyone that truely matters is here at the house (excluding Dad who is at the hospital with mom). We all can't believe this is happening, it's all to fast, we need more time to prepare. I don't know what to do, I'm so scared of the future. Wylee can only stay for 2 weeks at the most before he must go back to Iraq. I don't know what to do anymore. I just so glad I have my family and my Jacob, I don't know where I would be without the support of them. But honestly we are all a mess, especially dad. I dont' know what to do about anything anymore. We all knew that if mom left us like this I would most likely have to move in with my dad in Virgina but I just don't know what to do right now. God I just can't talk about this anymore, I'm begining to cry again. My eyes burn so bad from crying all day. Ugh, I'm so scared, I need someone to hold me, talk to me, I need a hug real bad. I'm so tired..
