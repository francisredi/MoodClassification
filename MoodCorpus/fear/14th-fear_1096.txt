Tornadoes
Around 4am our phones rang.  It was the Weather Channel letting us know there was a severe thunderstorm warning in Cobb, where we live.  I turned on the Weather Channel to see what was going on, and after a few minutes asked Jay if he could get my plants & the birdfeeders off the porch.  We had the TV muted, and I was half-asleep, listening to him on the porch, and then after he came in, unplugging things in the den.  The lights kept flickering and dimming, which made me sit up.  And there it was, on the screen: Tornado warning for Cobb County.  Then the sirens started.

Tornado sirens scare the living shit out of me.

I started hollering for Jay.  We threw the cats in their carriers in the pink bathroom, dumped them in the tub, and I ran into the bathroom with our heavy duvet and cell phones.  We huddled together and prayed.  Yeah, okay, it was terrifying.  Especially when the wind picked up and blew hard against the den wall in gusts topping 50mph.  We heard small amounts of hail hitting the roof.  After about 10 frozen minutes of intense praying (yes, dear family, we are in fact religious), the wind let up.  Jay grabbed the laptop and a quick look at the TV.  In a few minutes, the tornado warning was lifted.

After it was all over I asked Jay if it was okay if I threw up now.  He said yes.  And then I did.

So yeah, good morning.  I'm awake now, how about you?
