Nightmares
I'm stressed. Espeacially since yesterday and today are very important concerning me and my beloved girlfriend. I had hoped she would call me yesterday, but she didn't. This night, I had one of the worst nightmares in all my life.

We were on a tour by bus, in this dream with my co-workers, but that was unimportant, even in the dream. I thought in that dream, that this was a good start for fixing our problems. We went in that bus, and I picked a seat for us next to a heater, becauses she gets cold really fast. But she picked another seat, next to a stranger. So I went over there, but she stood up and went to the place I picked a few seconds earlier, and with her, that stanger.

We went out of the bus, and she strode away ot even noticing me. So I ran after her, asking her is she got any fgeelings for me at all. She turned, glared at me and said in an angry cold voice: "No!"

Then I woke up, and now I'm still terrified and fear the moment she will call me, or I call her becauses she doesn't.
