I wish I updated more but no one reads this anyway.
I need to stop being so scared, and scaring my boyfriend. I can't help it though, I just don't want to be like her and I'm freaked out that it is going to happen. I'm just scared. I wish I could just know.
How do you know it's forever? How can you have absolutely no doubts that this is going to work? Is it normal for me to be so scared/ realistic? I just don't want to get hurt/ hurt him. I wish I had a fortune teller, or someone to tell me that they understand me. I guess I just lost a lot of faith in true love, marriages that work and healthy relationships along time ago. It's easy to pretend that I think it is going to work, but I've gotten to the point where I need to be realistic in order to keep myself from being majorly let down.. is that wrong? I'm 19, and we are in different stages in our lives. I still want to be young and not think about getting married and just enjoy my time in college, but at the same time the fairy tale can be nice to dream about. I just feel so conflicted right now. I look at my friend who is so obsessed with her boyfriend and marrying him and it just weirds me out. I'm not ready for that.

I don't want to feel this way but I can't help it.
