Last update of today, I promise
Wow.  There are mixed feelings going on here, yes there are.
On the one hand, I'm very glad that it was not a vision that had me aging one year an hour all day; on the other, I'm not sure I like what it *was* all that much.  What am I saying?!?  I never want to sleep again!
Have not been this frightened in a long time.  I keep getting told to calm down and stop worrying about it, but it's shaken me, all right?  I found myself in a place where I had no right to be, and now that I know where, I don't know what to think.  I didn't even know it was POSSIBLE to get there.  Let's see if I can make an analogy here, have you ever sleepwalked when you were staying the night somewhere other than your house?  And then when you wake up, you don't know where you are or how you got there, and you are scared crazy by not knowing.  Then you find your family and they tell you it's all right, you did nothing wrong, nothing to be scared of shhhhhhh go back to bed.
And you do, but you are afraid that, when you awake again, you won't be in this bed.
It was kind of like that.  Only, let's say the first time you wake up you are in someone else's room.
I kind of don't want to have to be still tired.
