WARNING - a ranting and whinging post 
why can't life be all simple? I hate the fact that I can't spend Chinese New Year with my folks! by the time it ends, it's already my second day of Uni. It doesn't help either with the early BBC 24 hr news broadcasting the celebrations in Hong Kong and China. I mean, this time last year it wasn't so bad because I had all the Queen Annes girlies to go to the chinese restaurant and we had our "Away from Hong Kong Chinese New Year Dinner". That was great, but this year, all the chinese girlies are in seperate unis all around London and yeah, I know I can meet up with them at some point but it's not the same as our New Year get together. Ah well, I'm just complaining and whinging this whole post, you have been warned in the title of this post. 

Feeling the effects of Homesickness as well, in which wishing that whole of Hong Kong could be air lifted by several helicopters and plonked in the middle of London somewhere seems like a perfectly rational request. I know I'm being stupid, I realise that I'm going to be home soon, however I still get homesick and I just don't know why. 

I'm guessing that it's also that I've become a compelete worrywart over the years. I have never been like that at all, I have no idea why I'm so anxious now a days it scares me sometimes. I worry about big things, but then I worry over completely stupid things like not be able to get a phone credit card in time hence I won't be able to contact my parents. Or having no time because my new timetable might not give me a day off. 

more worries include:

- I might have to go to a new Campus this semester, one that I just don't know how to get too
- Money issues, I have to be completely careful this semester got to make it last till the last day before the Summer Holidays. 
- Rent which does go into money issue but I'm still stressing about it
- Losing weight to please my mother and to get healthier. 
- Going back to my uni accomodation tonight
- The cold weather, I don't want to get sick again but the average temp is like 5 degrees. 
- Tasha's b-day (I don't know if I can make it but I don't want to upset her either, healthy compromise anyone?) 

I don't like stressing! I made myself sick last time I was stressed and anxious and I don't want frown lines just yet.
