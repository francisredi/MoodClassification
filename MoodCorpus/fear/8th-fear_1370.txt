Supernatural Route 666


The fact that there was sex, and nakedness and snark and dimples and lots of fun of that nature was completely overshadowed by the fact that I am completely, totally, and undeniably terrified of the whole "killer car" thing to the extent that I have issues with crossing parking lots in the dark. 

Christine scared me worse than the Exorcist. 

I'm particularly scared of the "killer car in the living room" situation. 

So I guess it should be no surprise that during this episode I ended up crawling up the back of the couch screaming: "GO UPSTAIRS! GO THE FUCK UPSTAIRS YOU MORON!!!! NO NO NO DON'T GO NEAR THE WINDOW AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUUUUUUGH!!!!" 

*sheepish* 

And although the writing on SPN is typically - not award winning - they obviously do their research. Athens is not only the home of Ohio University, but is one of the most haunted places in the state. I personally know people who have had weird experiences there. 

They also have this huge Halloween party every year wherein people get drunk, often riot, and the police make lots of arrests. Just so you know. 

I have to level a smackdown on the lack of southern accents. That bothered me worse than the snow. 

*sigh*

I'm so going to have nightmares....
