Worst possible nightmare
I went to bed about midnight or so last night while my husband, the amazing Brett, was still up finishing a project for him work. I had only been asleep for about 15 minutes - it couldn't have been much longer than that - and for some reason I opened my eyes - sitting there just as big and bold as happy as can be was a freaking black widow spider. Just sitting there on Brett's side of the bed. Looking at me!!! Argh! I freaked out - I seriously came unglued. I jumped out of bed screaming and running and crying. Brett and I went through the whole bed trying to find it but sweet fancy moses - we couldn't find the fu@king thing! I have no idea where it is now. We got a flash light and went through the bedding, looked under the bed and between the bed and the wall - nothing. It took me forever to get to sleep last night and I made Brett leave the light next to our bed on all night...I am still feeling creepy oogie and gross. One good thing is while black widow spider bite is poisonous, it really isn't deadly in this day and age. Oh I mean for about 1 percent of the population it is but mostly it hurts and is annoying and scary...

I hate spiders. Ick! I freaking hate them!
