Lies... and the lying liars who tell them
I think I have a problem with lying. I also have a problem with swearing but I need to address my issues one at a time here. This past weekend I went to Ames to visit some friends and I backed my car into a Suburban. I crushed my rear bumper and felt like a real ass (we'll get to the swearing someday, I promise). I drove home that night and woke up the next morning to go to work. I didn't feel like going to work. This isn't news. I decided to call my boss and lie and say the collision happened that morning and I had to wait around for the cops and I wouldn't be in for another hour. This was the first lie. All it got me was 30 more minutes of sleep.

I went to work, people asked me why I was late, I lied. I had to wait until my boss left the office to call the insurance company so she wouldn't know that I lied. I didn't lie to the insurance company. I got a Nissan Altima for a rental car. It drives pretty well but the interior is shitty looking (no lie). Tomorrow I have to go to my parents' house to get some pictures for my apartment. Now, I can't lie about having been in a car accident because an Altima doesn't look much like a Saturn, but I may have to lie about the details of the accident because they don't know I went to Ames. It wouldn't be such a big deal to just tell them that I went to Ames, but I already lied and told them I couldn't meet them for lunch last Saturday because I was sleeping. I wasn't sleeping, I was 200 miles away in Ames being Liar McLies a bunch.

So now I've lied myself into this great big hole and I can't lie my way out. And, of course, since this is my first post ever, anyone who reads it will know that I'm a liar and won't believe anything else I say. At least it's all out in the open.
