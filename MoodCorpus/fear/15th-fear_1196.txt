every day that passes from now on i have only one thing to look forward to; the day that i can get the hell out of here. get the hell out of herndon. get the hell out of line mountain. leave the shithole that i've spent 7 years of my life in. leave the kids who don't know when to shut up or act their age. i won't regret leaving. but i never said i won't miss something.

i will miss the days where i would actually get along with kids i normally can't stand. i will miss the times where i could make people laugh. i'll miss my friend-type-things. i'll miss the girls who made this year worth-while. i'll miss the boy who made me mad, sad, happy, and annoyed. i'll miss the hugs i get from certain people. i'll miss the hearts and frown-faces i've made on numerous desks.

i'm scared, though. i'm terrified of not fitting in. i don't want to turn gangsta. i like the way i am, and i like the music i listen to. and i like my shirt with the zombie on it :[ and i won't start typing LYkE dIzSs. i don't want to have to change who i am to fit in.
