in which i wibble.
I feel like an ass asking this, but I need some help with kanji, for anyone that may secretly be a kanji pro. I just want to make absolutely sure these are what they are labelled as in my files before I go and do something stupid like embed the words 'Dog Taco Whore' with ink into my skin for life. Although, that would be pretty damn funny & would amuse me till the day I died. If you have any clue about this stuff, I'd really appreciate the help.

Am thinking of getting the second set between my shoulder blades and down. Anyone have ink there? Did it hurt really bad? I've five tattoos and none of them hurt, but I've never had one that near to bone or on my back. The first set, if you care, I'd like to get rather small down my right side, between the bottom of my ribcage and my hipbone. Am not so much worried about that one as I have that other bigger one on my stomach near the left hip and it didn't hurt at all. But the back thing is really freaking me out for some reason. I'm near hyperventilating at the idea, which really only encourages me more to do it, but still. Bring on the horror stories!
