An hour in the chair again
So the periodonist wants to remove some of my gums that are covering up part of one molar, and threatening to on another.&nbsp; I understand why they want to do it, despite my mom misunderstanding why I'm upset with this and talking to me for 20 minutes in the car about how if I don't have it done, I'll have a ton of problems when I'm over, and how her coworker has to go for 11 visits to the periodonist to fix whatever wasn't fixed earlier...etc etc.&nbsp; No, that's really not it.&nbsp; I understand why it has to be done.&nbsp; I'd rather do it now than wait.&nbsp;&nbsp;

What I don't like is that I get local anesthsia and laughing gas.&nbsp; And a sleeping pill because I'll be nervous when I came in.&nbsp; I'm nervous because they're not knocking me out!!&nbsp; That's the reason I'm nervous, I don't want to be awake while they're cutting things out of my mouth!&nbsp; I'd rather go in, be nervous, get put to sleep, then wake up and it's done.&nbsp; I don't want to be drowsy and out of it all day.&nbsp; I hate that.&nbsp; I've always hated that.&nbsp; Maybe it's some unexplainable fear, but I hate it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

I can handle pain.&nbsp; I'm a woman, and I've endured braces and TMJ, I can handle pain, even dental pain.&nbsp; So why do I have to be awake.&nbsp; I said that to my mom and again she misunderstood, I'm not nervous about the proceedure, I know that it's their job and they're very good at it.&nbsp; I'm not even nervous about my jaw getting screwed up like I was with my wisdom teeth.&nbsp; It's the medication.&nbsp; I don't like being in a fog, I don't like it when things are clear.&nbsp; It's the reason I will never drink or do drugs.&nbsp; I do not want an altered state of mind.&nbsp; That is not my idea of fun.&nbsp;&nbsp;

I also have a nice long time to wait and think as I always do, and become more nervous about it until the last week in July.
