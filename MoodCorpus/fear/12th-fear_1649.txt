Dmitri is sick.

Poor little bugger is burning up like nothing i've seen before, has had a head ache for the past 3 days, where i thought it was because he was pitching the usual  after temper tantrum feel sorry for me crap.

His poor wee face is scarlet, and he's done nothing but sleep, and im not talking cat naps, im talking out cold and imprevious to outside stimuli.

the doctor has him on pain meds in the form of foul tasting syrups, and anti biotics, because the bairns throat looks red and sore. Looks like a throat infection. but i've never known a thoat infection to cuase this before.

I'm to observe him as closley as possible for signs of contious elevated fever, scalet rash on his body, and any bruising , bloodshottingand spots on his body.

Like i dont have enough to worry about right now, the doc has got it into my head that it might develop into something else, but he's not sure because of the lack of syptoms bar the throat fever and achy head.

Just what i need a 5 year old with possible scarlet fever or goddess forbid meningitis, although i think the latter is a tad extream it's nice of the doc to give me hady hints on what the worst could be.

*headdesk* I adore my son, and i can deal with the shits, and puking. I can administer his meds without feeling squimish, even if i have to pin him down to do it.

Cut scrapes gashes bruises blood and abcess are fine too. What i CANT handle is the unknown, mysterious headaches red cheeks , and thorat, and sleeping like the undead.

Could'nt be as simple as a puking bug could it. nope this is my life, it needs must be as complicated as possible.

im goin to bed, hopefully he'll be a little better in the morning.
