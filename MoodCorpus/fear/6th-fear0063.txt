STFD MAN.
This post isn't about anyone in particular. Although, it probably seems that way it isn't. If you think it is then....

Why is it that everything has to be about you? Is it necessary to make anything anyone does relate back to yourself? Maybe I'm overexaggerating this whole situation, but you're making me feel horrible and upset.  So how about this, you stop bitching and being self-centered and I'll be able to breath for once in the last few weeks. I'm so afraid that one day you'll go through with your plans, so I never say this to you. I don't want you to hate me for saying what I feel, though that's your usual response to anyone with a different opinion than your own. But, most of all I'm upset that I'm slowly seeing why you are the way you are and that I'm turning into the same person. I shall hope that I never turn into you but this is a vicious circle. One day you might be in my place and I hope when that day comes you say the truth and not the lies you've made to protect me as I have you.


...perhaps you should take the advice of one wiser than myself "STFD MAN!!!!" or maybe this advice, let your problems go and stop whining because your whining is helping no one. I should probably take my own advice shouldn't I?
