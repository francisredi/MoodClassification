a taste of angst
In other news, my teeth are still taking over my brain.  My mouth felt well enough today that I managed to chew some overcooked broccoli (something green besides avocado!  woohoo!), but then I made the mistake of looking at my mouth again.  Ugh.  One advantage of being a tea drinker is that I can tell how much damage is new by observing the color changes.  Just seeing that made me panic all over again, wondering if I should just accept tooth loss as inevitable.  I wish I knew why this all happened so suddenly and if there's a way to make sure it doesn't continue or happen again.  My mouth was abnormally dry early in the month, but it's been extremely dry in the past without going crazy like this. Was it just because my immune system decided to crap out on me or what?  Is this a signal of something else going wrong with my body?  And will I find out what to do about it before or after losing all my teeth?

I brush my teeth after meals.  I floss every night and occasionally during the day.  Let me be a lesson to you, children:  You still need to go to the dentist.
