I'm scared shitless..
As many of you probably know, there isn't much that really gets to me.  I take many things in stride, and I'm really not afraid of death/dying. I have the mentality of 'if it happens, it happens.' But what really scares me is living in some kind of a paralized state. Like with my arm.. its been progessivly getting worse.  Hurting more and more, til its almost constant, different levels of pain but there none the less.  Lack of dexterity, its hard to do things I used to do. Even with my full hand and both arms pressed against my chest I can't hold a screwdriver steady, to re-mount a hard drive.  The muscles seem to  have also become.. lax on the 'healthy/good' side of the arm/scar..

I'm just worried about how much time I have left with it.. and I don't know what I'd do when/if it goes. I've tried over the years to train myself to be left handed with no luck.  I just don't know what I'd do with half a useless arm. Other than hit people but that would get old.

I just kinda sit here, fearing that day when it comes, not sure what to do to avoid it..
