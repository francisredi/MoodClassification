when things get worse...
My dad went to the doctor this morning and it did not go well.... they say he has an infection in his sore  and that his two sores are the worst cases they have ever seen. The doctors seem to think there is an underlying cause for the pyroderma... which could range from gastrointestinal diseases to leukemia... they are going to do a blood work up and until that time going to treat him with antibiotics. I feel so helpless for my mother and my father, I am just hoping everything is ok. I made the mistake of writing about how I feel I have become too revealing to cara last night, now apparently she gathered I am mad at her or think she's a shitty friend because she's been busy lately.... ppl are too quick to infer things.

I am really worried that a friend of mine from the lj community on cerebral palsy hasnt contacted me... I hope she's ok???  AMY WHERE ARE U??? Started dating this new guy named wayne. He's 26, and has cystic fibrosis... he could be good for me. Maybe someone will finally stick around maybe someone will finally think I'm pretty.
