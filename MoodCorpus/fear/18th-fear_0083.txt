Blood [sugar].
The ups and downs of my blood sugar are frustrating.Today, back above 200, this morning. I don't even remember whether or not you B.S. is supposed to be higher in the morning. I took my meds and didn't think much about it. But at work later I checked it and it was still high. I am afraid that I might not be able to get by on just oral meds right now. But I am hoping that, continuing to eat the right foods, exercising and going to Weight Watchers and getting on their program again will get that blood sugar down. Yesterday i think it was low because I was pretty active, lifting the box with the stationary bike around and generally exerting myself. I will ride the bike tonight, continue to eat right and hope tomorrow goes fast.I feel good, that's a good sign. There have been times over the past several months that I nearly fell asleep at my desk. Meanwhile my mental health is good, and I want to start discussing the implications of divorce with my therapist, as&nbsp;I said before. And I am getting pressure from my friend as to where she is still telling me that it's the best...the ONLY thing...to do. She might be right, but is there a hidden agenda.Now I'm going to donate blood. Ironic, isn't it? Then off to the eye doctor. I don't care what they say, I need new glasses, so I am going to tell her my blood sugar is under control. It was, at least yesterday.
