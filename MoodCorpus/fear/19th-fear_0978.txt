A Graduate is Me!
Here I am at my parent's place, taking it easy, listening to 2 Sense, sipping a Smirnoff cooler, and contemplating the next part of my life that is about to begin.

I have been waiting for this day for a long time, since I finished all of my final courses back in December, and now that the day is finally here, I'm feeling nervous as heck.

I went in today to pick up my gown and order my official transcripts to send to my job in South Korea, paid off an old overdue fine for the library, and picked up a shirt from the bookstore. All the while, however, I've been feeling nervous about the entire thing, despite my checking to see if everything has been confirmed. I just have this horrible image of whoever it is that gives out the degrees giving it to me, then turning around, taking it back, and saying "Oh, I forgot to tell you this back in December, but you missed one more credit, so you can't graduate."

Even thinking about it now is enough to drive my blood pressure up. I know it's silly to believe that such a thing will happen, but after having my life delayed a good year and a half by the university due to their stupid mistakes, I just can't shake the fear.

Here's to hoping everything goes well...
