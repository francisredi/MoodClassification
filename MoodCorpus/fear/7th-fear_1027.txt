Houston, we have confirmation . . .
Hospital called yesterday.  We have to be there at 7, her surgery is at 9.  They said it takes about an hour after she gets into the main recovery room to go home.  She has to show them she can eat a popsicle without puking and pee before we can go home.

She seems fine.  I, on the other hand, am a panic attack waiting to happen.  They have topical numbing gel that will go on her hand before the IV and they said if she is too freaked out they'll give her a puff of gas to calm her down.

And her attitude is back.  I get to deal with the little 16 year old the weekend before surgery.  I'm trying to be patient but BOY does she have a hot head.

We are off to her cousin's 16th birthday party tonight and to WalMart tomorrow to load up on soft foods.  Coloring books, movies, etc.

I hope we'll be home by 1:00.  I will be back before then but that is the name of the game right now.
