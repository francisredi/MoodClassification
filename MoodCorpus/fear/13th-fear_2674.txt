WEEK 5: Fear.
Just how nice would it be to live in a world where we actually felt safe?  I can safely say I get scared- like easily AND quite frequently.  Coming home the other night by myself, I found myslef absolutly running from the car to the front door, hurrying to open the door (whilst making enough noise that it woke my parents)all because of the scary stories we all had spoken of earlier day.  I get scared someone is chasing me, I get scared that someone is hising in the bushes.  It wasn't until recenently that I couldn't have a shower or bath whilst in the house by myself, in fear that someone will attack me.   I am also afraid to walk the streets at night by myself.  But- what essentailly is it that we are all afraid of?  Is it being alone?  being with someone? being without someone? death? life?  We are all living in fear of one thing or another to the point that it can eat us up, erode away all our happpiness, distort our notion of "the perfect life" and lead us to lead a tormented life.
