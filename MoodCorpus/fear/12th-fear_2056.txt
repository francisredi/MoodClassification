Okay, I didn't get to go on the floor last night but, 
I did get to expedite. Which was fun, cause I got to learn my plates better. I also burned my arm with a hot plate, but that's okay. I was so irritated and pissed when I first got in because I knew I wasn't going to make anymoney when I saw I wasn't on the floor. You know what really sucks? They're probably going to put me on the floor when it gets it's busiest. Like Friday or Saturday, even tonight if they would. But probably not. I'm probably going to be expediting tonight again. Expediting is where you get plate groupings set up, and you put them together, and/or take them out for the server. I really want to be making some money. I want to be on the floor, but I get so nervous around other people. I half panic and half freak out on the customer! I need to work on my anxiety. I need to see a doctor about these feelings. I really do feel like I have some kind of anxiety issue. I'm always jumpy, I freak out really easily, I panic over the smallest thing, and I'm even starting to think I have a slight case of OCD, obsessive compulsive disorder. I always have to do certain things, not just like a routine, but consistently everyday the same thing over and over again. Like brushing my teeth like 5+ times a day! Anytime I get something in my mouth I HAVE to brush my teeth. And at work, I'm there with a napkin brushing my teeth. I dunno maybe it's a quirk, the few things I do everyday. Maybe I'm just quirky, but I do really believe I have an anxiety disorder. I just don't think anyone should be this jumpy, or panic stricken most of the time. It's getting worse too. I need help. I'll look it up on the internet. I need Marleena's medicaid first, then I can work on getitng myself some insurance.
