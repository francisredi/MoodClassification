Wild weather
There has been some wild weather unfolding in central Illinois and into Indiana tonight. Tornadoes, straightline winds, etc... I had no idea this was going on, was in Terre Haute with a friend. We started back and all the sudden this huge wall of rain and wind hit us and I had to pull over. Finally, after getting back on the road, there was debris all over, small limbs, chaff and junk off the fields, etc... then I nearly hit a tree. Yup, a pine tree was lying across the road. I managed to get around it, then encountered another large tree about a mile down. I went around it and stopped a guy to warn him, and he said, "Yeah, I know. I was headed the same way you are, but before you get to the state line, there's another tree across the road, no way around." Booooo! So I turn around, go back into West Terre Haute and proceed up US 150. There was still debris and a tree down across one lane of traffic near New Goshen, but it cleared up gradually after that. All in all, it took what usually is a half hour drive over an hour just because of the roadblocks and being careful. 

Also, damage was reported to buildings in Champaign, Urbana, Springfield, Brocton, and other towns. Roofs blown off, walls missing, and other things. It's dark and power is out many places, so it's hard to get a true assessment. Guess we'll know more in the morning.
