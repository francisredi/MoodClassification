Ready?
MICA gave me a call. They're giving me (a little) more money. Had a nice chat. I think I'm going to Baltimore. That mere 1% chance has turned into a significantly larger 80% chance of going. Goodness. My parents and I need to have a chat.

I'm missing so much schoolwork. I keep forgetting about assignments. Writing them down doesn't help because I always forget to check. I'm supposed to be painting up a storm for AP Art. Why am I still here? Why isn't my Art History done? How come I don't understand anything related to Macroeconomics?

Last night, I found a 'Desperate Housewives' news item so I spent about five minutes writing up a quick piece. When I got back from school today, I found about five pages of new e-mails of straight comments. What the fuck? Is Eva Longoria really that blab-worthy?

Got my paycheck in the mail today. Suddenly overcome with a strangely girly desire to go out and buy shoes. I think I need a new set of heels for the banquet.

I'm still in a panic. I honestly feel like I'm going to throw up at any moment. Everyone's been making an effort to comfort me and, while I appreciate it, it's not working. I really want to just get this anxiety out. Through tears, through vomit, through a violent reaction... whatever. It's just not coming. It's making my skin crawl.

Should get some sleep.
