Tomorrow, tomorrow...
So, tomorow is a pretty big day. I'm nervous as hell and I don't know what to do with myself. By the way tomorrow is the Greek Easter as well as my boyfriends 17th birthday, so I'll be going to his house to once again be introduced with his whole family and spend a good few hours with them. I want to make a good impression again and I want them to really like me. I already know his sister despises me, for reasons that I'm unaware of, but I want the rest of his family to like me. I don't know why they wouldn't like me, but they could find reasons...everyone and anyone could find reasons not to like me. I'm scared that I won't meet their expectations, that I fall short of that line that they set up, the line that defines whether a person meets their families criteria or not. I don't want to fall short of that line, I want to be on that line and surpass it. But what if I'm not? What if they all give me evil glares like she does? What if they all decide that they don't want me to be a part of his life and try to convince him to leave me again? There are so many what ifs going on in my head that it's driving me insane, and tomorrow is supposed to be a good day...I don't know. I let my wander too often and that is not a good thing. Ok well that is all for now.
