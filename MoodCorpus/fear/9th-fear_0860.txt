More Signs of End Times in the News...
I checked the news this morning and was greeted by the following misleading headline:
Cartoon protesters try to storm U.S. base
which led me to believe for an instant that Bugs Bunny, Donald Duck, Yogi Bear, and Hong Kong Fooey were engaging in hostilities against our military...  For a moment I was simultaneouly amused and scared.

Then I remembered what it was really about, and I was simultaneously saddened and scared.

The weirdest part was watching some of the news footage last night. They showed Islamic protesters crossing the moat to storm the Danish Embassy.

No, you read that right. The Danish Embassy has a moat; it always has -- they didn't build it in response to current events. The only possible bright spot in all of this is that hopefully there's a very satisfied architect and/or landscaper somewhere in Denmark who watched that same footage and thought, "HA! They laughed at me when I proposed the moat, but here, at last, after lo these many years I am vindicated! See?! It wasn't such a crazy idea after all!"

And to round out the harbinger-watch, this headline was also one of CNN's "Top Stories":
Boo Boo the chicken saved by mouth-to-mouth
