AAAAAAAAAAHHHH!
can any say freaking the fuck out!! I have to leave for philly in like not even 4 days for dance auditions and I have no idea WHAT THE HELL I'M DOING!!! I still have to choreograph like 3-5 mins. of a dance and have it at performance LEVEL by WEDNESDAY!!! I think I may actually be sick. I may actually get so nervous that I may vomit all over the library - which would actually be kind of funny...but that's a random side note.  And on top of that, we are in the midst of pledging, sorry NME, and it is time for midterms. and despite the fact that I am a dance major - no comments from the peanut gallery - i do have midterm exams/tests to take, that I now have less time to study for since I have to take everyone several days earlier! UGH!! What the hell was I thinking when I decided I wanted to go to grad school? What the hell will happen if I don't get in? I really want to. I try to pretend like it doesn't matter, but I REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY...want to go to grad school.  

i need to go home. i need to work. i need to get myself together. i need a beer! :o)
