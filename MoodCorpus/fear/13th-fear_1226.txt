The Murderer
I know GIC commented once about how you would feel if someone you knew went to prison. Well I'm looking at one. 

I was in the same grade as his brother and he is a year older than us. I think I was a senior in high school when he broke into a house in my dads neighborhood. He raped and killed a 60ish year old woman and before leaving the scene of the crime he deficated on her chest. Heartless.

I knew he was in prison. I remember him going up for parole and it being revocated. His dad tried to get my friends dad to write a letter to the parole board in his favor. He never wrote the letter because we all thought he was were he belonged.

Apparently he got out. I'm going to check the V.I.N.E. to see if he is indeed on parole. Even if he is or isnt, he has already gotten trouble with the law because he is right here, infront of me going over the terms of probation. He is ordered to do an alcohol assment and domestic violence. Going by that one would assume he got drunk and beat up his girlfriend. Who knows the details. I just cant believe he is out walking the street!

Insane! This is totally creepy! 

OMG! He just told my boss this is his 4th, 4th degree assault. Way to go! Lets work on the 5th!!
