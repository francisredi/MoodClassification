Them...Its them..
The potion I made isn't working, I worked so hard on it. I need help, I have finally broken down to it.. It is that which burns inmy mind, screams, yelling, past noises. I know why, I don't know how to stop. I can't remember much of my life past 13, due to my theory from a dream of a building I hid in during nightshade citie's destruction crumbling onto me and banging my head. These screams and sounds are from ym past, the osund slipping out while the pictures and images of it staying in my subconcious. But there what I want to stop is more troubling. They have no theory for their existance from me. 

Two voices, one deep and cold, a cool speaking one. It has been trying to make me kill all of you that read this, give me images of what I could do to make your days nightmare. I would normally think of this as my shoulder devil, and the other my angel, but the other is not an angel of any sort. It speaks in a voice raspy, a whisper in my mind. It says it is the reason my memory's sound is slipping out before my memories themselves. They keep me up, I have had little sleep for a long time. I need help, a psychiatrist maybe.. I don't know, but my means of helping myself have all failed, and I refused others trying to get rid of my damned problems, but I have broken down...
