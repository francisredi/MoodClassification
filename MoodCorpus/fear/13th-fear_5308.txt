the dentist
I'm scared to death of the dentist, so what do i do, I wait 4 years to go.  Last week after literally years of putting it off, I made an appointment to go to the dentist.  They were able to squeeze me in for this Friday.  I'm scared, so what do I do, I go buy 2 new kinds of floss, new mouthwash "repairing ACT" and the baking soda peroxide toothpaste (makes you feel so clean) and yesterday I even bought a new power toothbrush.  I'm also now using a waterpik...why because my teeth are scaring me.  Yes they look so pretty from the front, I often get the 'you have such a nice smile' but lurking back in the back are the demons.  I'm sure I'll have cavities, I'm imagining the worst, maybe even something big.  I've not had my wisdom teeth taken out because after my dentist told me I would need to schedule an appointment to take them out next time I come in...I never came back in.  

The root of it all, Dr. Bender.  When i was little I went to Dr. Bender, the 'best pediatric dentist in all of  southern indiana,' he even gave out things that said "dr. bender's buddies brush best." What a clever man.  But a beast he was.  He made me cry and made fun of my kickass green and yellow pumas.  Bastard.  Since then I've hated the dentist. But now it's time to face the facts and be a big girl.  We should start a pool and bet on how many cavities I will have, anyone going to bet for a root canal?
