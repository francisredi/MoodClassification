The good and the bad
Went to Battle Creek today to visit Sarah.  It was good to get out of GR and even better to see a friend from school.  Her, her brother, her friend James and I just hung out at her house, talked and tv with a few hours of sledding thrown in the middle of it all.  Good times and good laughs were had by all.  Damn I need to get back to school.

I don't know why but the thought of 2006 is scaring the hell out of me.  I just have this terrible feeling that something very bad is going to happen to someone in my family.  Shit is already happening that could cause it.  My dad is very fat and over stressed, I fear a heart attack every day for him, My mom may have breast cancer and no doctor can tell us either way at this point, Liz may be making one of the biggest mistakes of her life, and Annie is having fairly bad depression.  I am so fucking scared for my family and there is not jack shit I can do.  As for me...  something is missing.  A hole exists but I don't know what is gone that was there a few months ago.
