Trying Not To Scream
Totally freaked myself out. I stayed up watching Ghost Hunters with my mom. She fell asleep and I didn't really feel like going back up the stairs. Eventually it got to the point where I was too scared to. And like... now I'm all freaked out. All the lights in my room are one and I'm playing music as loud as I can. That and I've taken the laptop and are now sitting in by bed because I feel rather naked almost sitting at the desk. 
I really shouldn't let this stuff get to me. Now I'm like dead tired but I can't get my heart to stop beating so I can sleep. It's so aggravating. I may have to watch some of Ichigo Mashimaro just to get myself to calm down. 
Argh, I'm thirsty. But the soda is all downstairs. I'm so not going down to get it.
Contary to popular belief, I don't like being scared. I really shouldn't watch these ghost things late at night. That's when they bother me the most. 
Brittany kicked me out of her room. She didn't really comfort me much. In fact, I'm pretty sure she couldn't have cared less about me being scared. She just called me a baby and shooed me away. I mean- well she did offer me her room- but like she said if I stayed in her room she was staying in mine. I told her that defeated the purpose. I just wanted to be with someone else. 
Needless to say, I'll have a bit of trouble going to bed tonight.
