dreams are there to show you the way (take a look inside)
I had a dream this morning where Linley and Rhonda held a sleepover at my house without telling me. So there were all these people around the house and I was like "...o.O!!"

I went upstairs and into Jonathan's room where Linley and Rhonda were sitting on the bed chatting. I confront them, obviously upset that they've held a party without my permission, in my house. They become upset with me and it ends with Linley shouting at me. I storm off and go and sit on on my couch in the living room. Tara is sitting on the other end. 

Then Rhonda comes downstairs and starts yelling at me again, and starts stabbing me with a pencil - one of those plastic ones where you change each "tile" when the current one is blunt. It hurts. I try to wrestle it off her but she's too strong. I call over to Tara "Help! Please!!" but Tara just stares at me impassively and then hands Rhonda back the bits of pencil that had been flung about everywhere so she can stab me more.


There was another dream where I could become invisible.
