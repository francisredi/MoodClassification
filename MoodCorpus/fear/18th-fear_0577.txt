friends
in the last three weeks, life has been crazy. i have realized how important certain people are in my life and how others are there just when it is convenient for them. but most of all, i have learned that there are some people who arent just my friends. but they mean the world to me. and without them, i dont kow where i would be or if i would be the person i am without them in my life. if they were never there then i think a part of my heart would be empty because they fill it.&nbsp;

there has been so much going on in the last year that i almost lost one of the most important people in my life. and it scares me because what about when i leave in august? will i loose everyone? both of us have had so much going and we make time but what about when i am 2300 miles away? what then? and what happens if she finds someone to take my place? in the last year i have leanred that no matter what happens she will be the best friend i've ever had in my life. and no matter how messed up things got between us this summer we kept ending up in the same spot, running to each other when we couldn't deal with life. and i am just so scared that next year i will loose that. and what will i do then? where will i go? what happens when i can't deal with life? do i go to someone else?

i am just so afraid of loosing the only people who i've ever let get this close to me..
