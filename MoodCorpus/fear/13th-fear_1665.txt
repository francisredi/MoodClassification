my reality check bounced.
we barely even speak. i dont know if this is good or bad. i feel guilty about it. but he isnt making an effort either it seems. 

i am back to how i was before i had mark, and it was really hard to remember. i am nervous and vomitting frequently becauase of it. always anxious. when we were together i was so calm and felt really good majority of the time. now that i cant even lay down next to a guy without gagging, i feel somewhat incomplete. i am serching for affection and perhaps it is in the wrong places, but i dont know. im not quite sure how i feel about guys now anymore. i dont know if i should call mark or not. i really dont know. and everyone knows nothing is worse than uncertainty. 

i want to be alone, but i dont. i want to be alone because 1) i feel like i need to be for awhile and 2) i would be constantly vomitting because i am scared to go on dates and even just hang out with guys on my own. im so not accustomed to it.

i ache all over.

no one is really accustomed to this because it always seems like im a bit fearless and a light hearted comedian type. but...

im one seriously fucked up individual.
