Guns don't kill demons...
I hate myself, pure and simple. That's what it comes down to. Nothing helps. Drinking didn't help, it made me weak. So I turned to food; which I often do. It made it worse. Then I tried throwing up; I failed. I don't have the energy or determination to put up with the pain. I hate inner pain. Shit on the surface I can deal with, I've made a living of dealing with it. But this constant inner ache is slowly killing me. Then I took pills to try to make things better, they won't, it will get worse. So now, I will go to bed and wait for my body to rebel.
I feel like my body is dying. My heart pounds just from standing, it feels like it is going to stop any moment. My arms and legs feel like I haven't slept in days. My head and eyes ache and burn. My mind is filled with a chaotic darkness. I am edgy and get set off at anything.
My only hope is to seek the quiet safety of my bed. But even there I am weak and vulnerable. A sleeping body is easy prey for evil.
