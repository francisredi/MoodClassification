I have just been told that I look like Ingrid Bergman. Personally, I don't really see it, but I'm intensely flattered. Seriously, man. I've been scrutinizing pictures of her and my own reflection so catch the resemblance. Maybe something about the nose and mouth. 

God I wish I had her cheekbones. 

I caved and joined OkCupid. Found a guy who eerily is everything I'm looking for, but I'm hesitant to message him. Yes, I'm a chicken. Total. Chicken.

Well, Ingrid and I will continue being chicken, and being vain, right now because there's nothing much else to do. 

My best friend has met a guy. I'm trying not to be sad about this. You see, if she gets a life, I won't see her as much. I'm afraid of getting replaced as an important part of her life. I know it's selfish, and I can admit this freely. But still...Sigh. I'll miss her if she starts dating. No more Hodaddy and his Beyotch. She's my best friend, I really shouldn't be worried. I'm just insecure.
