fear
when you get something you want you expect it to be a certain way and when it isn't that way you sometimes wonder what you are doing. but when they are the way you want them to be it kinda freaks you out. im  not sure how to describe it. it's like i don't wanna be that girl that came and left and i don't wanna ruin the future for another or whatever you know. when you don't have self-control you can do so much damage to others and yourself and so it comes down to that, can you be stronger than your wants? we would all like to think so i think and i just think ive made too many mistakes to be forgiven, but still, i tell myself not to worry. and i call my cousin for reassurance. we shall see. and sometimes when i look at pictures i just don't know who im looking at. you see people a certain way but then you look closer and as you pay more attention it freaks you out a little more if that makes any sense, but i don't think i make any sense right now. fear. i scare easy and when i am afraid i worry even if the worry is invalid or stupid. tomorrow i have finals that i am not studying for and now i am watching useless tv. and im thinking about painting my nails because my nails are getting ugly and i haven't changed them since prom. i think it's interesting that to love you need to be willing to be loved. yearbooks. how depressing. 3 days left. 3. how biblical.
