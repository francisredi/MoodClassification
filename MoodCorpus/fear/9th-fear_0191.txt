rings and work mistakes
Well, we have a ring on the way for me.  I am kind of picky about jewelry and clothes, so any bets about whether or not we'll actually be keeping it?;)  I think I'll like it but I don't know if I'll like it the most of the options.  I seem to agonize unnecessarily over many things.;)  It's been fun telling people!  No one has been exactly surprised but I have gotten a couple screams from women (of course).  

Ok, I totally screwed up at my internship.  I figured out today that long ago I should have request more sessions from 2 of my patient's insurance companies but I miscounted how many sessions were left.  My supervisor knows about 1 but I found the other after he left for the night so now I'm scared to face him on Wed.  It's a lot of $ down the toilet.  There's no good system in place and so it wasn't right in front of my face, and unlike in ADULT Psychiatry where they're on it, in CHILD psych the billing people apparently don't bother telling you that you submitted a service that had no accompanying authorization.  Also my supervisor never double checked it.  I know it was an honest mistake and everything, but I feel so embarrassed, horrible and have the worst feeling in the pit of my stomach.  I feel so stupid!  What a horrible way to begin my work week after such a great weekend;)

I do feel like I have way too much on my plate and the ball was going to drop sometime...
