Future MIA
Small announcement folks. I will likely be sporadically here for the next couple of days. Today was a special hell. I had a TIA stroke today.

I'm mostly ok. My left arm and leg are very weak. I still have a headache and the left side of my face still feels a little funny. The numbness is finally gone from my arm and tongue. I go for a CAT scan tomorrow and Hubby tells me I can't go to work even though we desperately need the cash. 

I've had a bad headache for 3 days and thought it was just stress. When I was getting ready for work this morning, I almost passed out but I thought I just stood up to fast. I was only at work for an hour when I suddenly lost vision in my right eye. I was in the middle of a conversation with my boss and co-worker when I suddenly forgot how to talk. I've never been so scared in my life.

I don't know yet what effect this TIA will have on me, 'cause a TIA always affects something on me. I seem prone to giggling maniacially for no apparent reason. I'm terrified that it will affect my writing like the previous one did. I will try to keep you all posted.
