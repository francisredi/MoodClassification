The drips of a sponge
Tis a true rarity that I want to lock myself up in my apartment and drink until I cannot feel the pain anymore.  As I look to the future, the next week in particular, the next two months in general... I need the support of friends near-by.  I have NOBODY that I can call on for that now.

Tom is in DC.  James joins him tomorrow.  Larry no longer speaks to me, that friendship is thoroughly dead.  I don't even have the chat room to count on these days... its DEAD in there now.

Tuesday my Mother goes in for surgical removal of tumors, and depending on what they find, possible hysterectomy.  Due to my current financial situation and work load, I cannot go back to be there with her.  

I've become borderline schizo.  The person I am at work and in the "real" world would never let on that she needs something more, some human companionship on the most basic of levels.  Once I'm here behind closed doors, when nobody can observe me...  I'm a sopping sponge dripping emotions, need, and a lot of tears.

What did I ever do to deserve this lonliness, this lack of caring in my life?  More importantly... Will it EVER change?
