more stress
The anniversary is over, and guess what, we did fight.  And guess what. I did not start it.  Or maybe I did, I forget.  Anyway, it was short lived, and the day ended up great.

So, Lindsay and I are going to look at a bunch of houses in the morning, I am not really looking forward to it.  I should be a lot more excited than I am.  I think it's partly due to the fact that this is a REALLY big change, and anyone who knows me knows how much I LOVE change! (sarcasm) 

On a darker note, I am apparently trying (despite my best efforts) to push Sela away.  I don't want to, I enjoy her company, and talking to her.  As my friend, I care about her deeply, but she terrifies me.  I feel so vulnerable.  I just wish that my air of detachment was a little more substantial.  Were she to decide that it is too much of a task to continue to attempt to be my friend, I would be crushed, so why can't I stop this childish game?  I haven't had a friend in so long, I think I forgot how.  

Why is it that I absolutely cannot wrap my mind around the concept that someone sould like me for me?  Chris accepts me as I am.  Angie does too.  John has been like a brother for more years than I know, he knows me perhaps even better than I do, and he accepts me.  Lindsay accepted me from the beginning when I was at my worst.  Why can't I accept myself?  I need to stop this before I cause another "joslyn incident". (those of you who know, explain please for the others.)  So that's it then.  Either I get over this problem that I have, or I have to let her go so I don't hurt her any further.
