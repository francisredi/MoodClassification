Art was  as easy as I thought it would be.  I doodled most of the time, since the actual test didn't even take 15 minutes.  Algebra, though, was HARD.  O.M.G.  I managed to get though it, but holy f*cking hell.  Some of that crap I didn't even reconize.  I know I'm absent a lot but I always copy notes.  It was insane.  I hope Ms.Pratt (the teacher) gets a paper cut grading them.

Tomorrow I have English and orchestra.  English is nothing, but orchestra's making me nervous already.  I can play the parts of the songs's we're being tested on, and the scales I know like the back of my hand, it's just when it comes to playing alone I totally freak out.  I rush, and I forget what I'm supposed to be doing.  Ugh.. I'm starting to think this class isn't worth the stress.  Ms.Burger seriously sucks all the fun from playing in there anymore.  I'm seriously considering not taking it next year.  I'll keep playing, just on my own.

At least it'll be friday. :P
