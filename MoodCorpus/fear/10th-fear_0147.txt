Interviews = stress
I thought that the interview phase of my life was over until I went looking for a postdoc position or something.  I could totally feel my face burning as I talked to the three professors, even though they were all mostly nice and conversational.  When I took a look at the mirror later, I saw that my cheeks were all red.  How embarrassing.

The first interview I had was with another zebrafish researcher.  He sort of treated me like any other recruit, like what I worked on, and then talked about his own work.  Then he gave me a tour of his fish facility and lab, both of which were several times bigger than my lab.  The second interview was pretty tough.  The guy kept picking on me, asking why I couldn't just continue my current project and why I was taking such a risky new project.  I think he kept asking the same things because I couldn't give specific answers.  (At least I got free lunch while I talked to him...roasted pepper and hummus sandwich and caesar salad, wasn't too bad of a deal).  The third guy asked the dreaded question "Do you have any questions for me about the department or anything related?"  I never ever have any ideas what to ask, and if I don't ask anything, I feel like I missed out on something or cut the interview short.  Everything I did as was sort of lame though.  Sigh.  He also asked me to go to the recruitment dinner and poster session...though (un)fortunately my antibody staining reaction was still going so I had to skip out on it.  

I think all that stress got me really tired.  I didn't get to do much except eat out at the Noodle House and get some tapioca/bubble tea.  After all that, I faced the disappointment of not having my DVDs arrive....again.  Only nine more days until I can contact the sellers and complain.
