life is SO unpredictable
I have lived in Glen Rock most of my life and nothing ever happens here.&nbsp; I mean were known for the fact that nothing happens.&nbsp; Come on, the most exciting thing to happen so far this year was getting new soap in all the bathrooms.&nbsp; (Foam soap that smells SOOO good...it was a HUGE deal everyones still talking about it.)
So I've gone about 15 years of nothing happening and all of a sudden there are rumors of gun threats??

Why now??? What a way to end the year.&nbsp; 2 weeks before my graduation and all of a sudden some freshman is threatening "another Columbine."&nbsp; I dont know whether to be terrified or to just not take it seriously at all.&nbsp; Right now im somewhere in between.&nbsp; I wasnt that nervous till the end of the day and all of a sudden everyone was talking about it and ... well you know rumors.&nbsp; The phone call from the school made me feel a lil better...its nice to know theyre at least doing something about it, theres gonna be cops at school tomorrow and everything.&nbsp; It should be safe.

I'm gonna go in,&nbsp;and im sure ill be fine.&nbsp; I'm sure nothing will happen and life will go on.&nbsp; But just for the record, all those times i wished that something...anythinggg would happen in this town....this was not what i meant :-\
