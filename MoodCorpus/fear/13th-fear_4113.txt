I'm embarrassed to admit...
I think I'm secretly a bit of an Ashlee Simpson fan.

Ok...please, before you judge me, let me try and explain.  I wasn't around for all the hype when she first "burst onto the scene."  I was in Ireland that summer, so I wasn't around to have "Pieces of Me" beat into my head.  I'm sorry...but I kinda like that song!  I know I shouldn't, but damn it, it's catchy.  I just heard it on one of my digital radio channels on cable and I found myself singing.  I always thought I loathed the likes of her.  

I think I know where this is coming from.  Last weekend I went to a birthday party and it was attended by some very fabulous gay men and they played another song of hers "L-O-L-O-L-O-V-E" and they freaking loved it and played it several times.  I'd never heard it, but I was drunk of my arse like the rest of them and we were tearing up the floor with that song!  Now I have that catchy bit stuck in my head.  

We're all allowed our guilty pleasures and I'm claiming both of those songs.  I don't know any of her other songs, and frankly I'm afraid to hear them, for fear I might start enjoying them as well.
