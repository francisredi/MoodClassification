where is my mind
friday night started with a really good nap.  then on the way to the festivities, i had a random panic attack.  after reading a medical book i realize that all symptoms of panic attack were there, especially the fact that it was random as i've been content and totally happy in life (as noted in previous entries) and nothing traumatic has happened.  though i have been having a few spells of light-headedness, nothing that lasts longer than a minute or two...didnt know until tonight that that could be a symptom of panic.  

friday night was drunken hilarity.  saturday afternoon, the trauma occured. a guy on a motorcycle drove into the hood of my car and fell into the street.  scariest thing that has ever happened to me in my entire life.  however, despite the extreme scariness, it was a really terrible thing that couldnt have gone better.  he barely had a scratch, he was wearing a helmet, i was only going like 25-30 mph and wearing my seat belt. i hit the brakes and not the clutch and my car stalled out so it totally stopped.  and did not run over him thank heaven.  it was his fault (he didnt see me as he pulled away from a stop sign)  everyone's fine, my car is barely touched (he knocked my front license plate off and cracked the bumper) i was terror-stricken and horrified.  the anxiety i had shaken off from the night before came rushing back to the extreme when i got home (though i remained relatively calm through the whole actual ordeal)

so i was really shaken up about that all night and still am.  more craziness ensued, 2 new cute pairs of shoes, and one more panic attack later i am still ridden with anxiety and thinking i should go watch some reality television and take a xanax. i am fucking exahusted.

lots of fun this weekend, but this whole anxiety thing is really getting in the way of being the true Renee. that rhymes :)
