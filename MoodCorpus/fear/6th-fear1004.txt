well today sure was...
eventful

i woke up. i started making breakfast and everything was fine. then i looked out the window and there was this guy with a crowbar at my neighbors house. i lost it. then i saw him coming over to our house. that crowbar scared me so much. he opened up our shed then went into the backyard and i started extra freaking out. so then i ran upstairs and locked the doors and saw him poking at the windows with his crowbar. i tried calling my mom but she wasnt there so i called ben, then called 911. i accidentally hung up on 911. so i called them back. anyway, the police came. i was in my pajamas, i hadn't showered, i hadn't brushed my teeth, brushed my hair or anything. when they came they told me that it was just the meter guy. it still scared me really really really a lot. i still feel really stupid and i'm kind of still freaking out. i can't believe the cops came.

i guess i'll just think of this as a learning experience.

so that was probably the least expected part of my day. but all is well and i didn't die. yey.
