The Nightmare 
Last night I had one of the worst nightmares of my life. I was laying normally, laying on my right side and before I fell asleep, I felt something blowing on my ear and the back of my head. Then I feel asleep. 

So I wake up and Im on my stomach with my head facing right and my arms out and I cant move. I try and open my eyes but I cant get them to stay open. I remember seeing the outline of a person but it was blurry. So I try and move and get up but I cant move my body, Im paralised. It feels like something is on top of me holding me down. I remember thinking in my dream that I needed to wake up and I felt this overwhelming sense of fear. I remember making noise and then all of a sudden I woke up. I dont know what happened. But when I did wake up, I was scared to open my eyes. I kept dreaming last night that I was being watched. That someone was behind me always watching me. I can even picture the person, like I was awake and saw them in my room. 

Im still very scared, Im not sure if I can sleep tonight.
