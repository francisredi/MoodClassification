I'm going insane!
I am literally a walking ball of anxiety. I am so much more nervous now after that interview because now I know what is at stake. A REALLY great internship, thats what. And of course the lady HAD to tell me it was between me and another person, so great, when i call her now i have to hear her tell me "You were really great, but we just decided to go with the other person", it will be so damn dissapointing. Its literally what Ive heard all my life. Im always "great, BUT". I swear, if i hear one more 'but' im gonna kill someone. i feel like i am always a close second, and for once in my life, i would like to feel like i am an individual who came in first. just this once. UGHGHHGHGHGHHG. i mean i know i should remain optimistic like i usually do, but the more i hype up myself on this the more i will be crushed. I usually follow my gut feeling, and my gut is truely telling me I wont get it. ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. so everyone, send me and the woman at HGA good vibes about it. pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.
