Scared Sick
Jenny's in bed now, tossing & turning.  It was torture running quick to the store for Gatoraid & water, because I had to leave her. My shoulders hurt with worry, twisted like a tightly-wrung rag. I wish I had the luxury of being able to unwind with Xanex, Ativan, or smoke out, but would not consider it, as I want to be here if she needs me. 

I'm worried sick bout her tho I know intellectually she'll feel better tomorrow (most likely). Isn't soon enough for me...for her, I'm sure it isn't soon enough. 

In seriously gonna go insane with worry while she's in Thai & I'm stuck stateside for a few days.  

I really really really care deeply about her.  It's scary, at times such as this exausting & sometimes burgeoning on inasnity. I mean, I worry hella lot about those I care for deeply, especially Sara, Allie & Laura for they don't have someone else to worry bout em...but it is distinctly different. I dunno.  I'm too stressed to get all analytical about it right now.

I just want to protect her from this, from everything, make everything all better all the time, take her pain & discomfort from her onto me.

There will be no sleep for me tonight.
