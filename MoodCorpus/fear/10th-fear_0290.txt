I'm SCARED SHITLESS for the first time in my life...
Uh yeah, I think for the first time I've been scared shitless.First weird thing that happened was last week was when my door opened. My door doesn't open unless someone opens it. Because when it's shut, it's shut. I thought it was my dad checking up on me, but for some reason the door was left open. I went into my parents' room and asked why they opened my door, and my mom was like 'Huh? I was sleeping' and my dad was in the bathroom the whole time. &gt;.&gt; That sorta bothered me because when it opened there was a clicking sound. Windows were shut, the wind does NOT turn handles.And just a few minutes ago, I went into the kitchen to put away my Nilla Wafers and whipped cream when the metronome on the piano just suddenly starting going off. This. Scared. The. SHIT. Out. Of. Me.And it worries me, it should worry me. Because I am one who DOES NOT believe in the supernatural at ALL. I believe in LOGIC and LOGIC ONLY. It's how I can watch so many scary movies and sleep &gt;.&gt; And I just rented White Noise, HOOOO BOY I'll have so much fun with this.
