west rock
Okay so we've been going to hide in the woods at this place called West Rock. and on the way there you have to cross this stream over this fucking pipe that is like fucking CRUCIAL! It fucking bugs me out I'm not even kidding. So much so that everytime we go to West Rock while were up there everyone is having a grand old time partying down but i'm like nothing but anxious aboutt he pipe. It like consumes my every fiber and I can't get my mind off of it. So the last two time we've gone up there have been fucking bad ass. But always in the back of my head is the pipe. Well last night I shared my fear with this other girl we were kicking it with and I guess my paranoia rubbed off a little because wouldn't you know neither one of us could make it over the pipe! The man had to come back for each one of us because we both got like halfway over and then fear just like grips you and your ass aint going NOWHERE.
Seriously i'm glad I conquered the pipe with the help of a friend <3. I hope you can all understand.
