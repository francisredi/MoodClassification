Welcome to my life
So not sure whats going on. Im really confused about stuff but who isnt.

New York was fantastic! It was a great time. I went to Time Square, shopping, Central Park, Ground Zero and China Town. I also went to a couple of bars! And met a nice Scottish guy that I ended up kissing...oops. I feel bad though. Not that great but still feel bad..even though it didnt mean anything either.

So now I am waiting to find out if I made the RA list for next year. Seeing if you are going to get back on so I can ask what we are going to be doing.

I dont understand what is going on with any of this shit. Moving on, staying back, pissed, happy...*sigh* It sucks when all your friends hang out with your ex boyfriend and dont understand why its so weird that I dont want to go over there. Whatever ya know? 
I really had to write on this thing but I lost my notebook that I normally write in. Maybe I left it at Jason's house. That would suck. If something happens I am deleting the phone number. woot woot. So mainly Im really nervous and not sure what to do. But CSI:Miami is on so I think I will watch that for a while. WOO so much fun for a Monday night.
