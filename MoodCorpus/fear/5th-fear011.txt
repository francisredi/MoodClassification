so i've always known that i was always really scared of a lottt o fthings. i have sooo many fears and i was well aware of that
but i never realized how much my fears held me back from doing so much
i don't know how to get over them though. i guess my bigest issue is acceptance since i can never let go of my past
but like.. i want to not be so scared anymore.
my list is so long. to name a few (and dont make fun of me): being alone, ending up alone when im old, divorce, death, mental disorders, ghosts or anything to do with dying for that matter like cemetaries, coffins, dead people etc, dying young, failing in life, getting pregnant at an early age, fear of dropping babies.. omg sooo many more but i just realized that within 5 seconds this all just came to my head and i didnt have to actually think hard...

i know that my fears are always holding me back and that they make me weak and its just pathetic. especially my number one fear, and that is dying. the thought of it makes me cry almost all the time.
