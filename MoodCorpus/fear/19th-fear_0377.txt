Update On My Health
Okay so as a lot of you know I went to the doctors this morning to have my CT Scan. I don't know anything yet, the doctor wants me to come into his office tomorrow so he can go over the results of all the tests with me. 

That makes me really nervous, the last time my doctor did something like that I found out I had Leukemia. I'm six years in remission now, but I'm not ready to go through all the radiation, chemo, and everything that goes with it. Not to mention the last time I had a bone marrow transplant my father donated because he was the only person who was a match. Of course I didn't know he was my father at the time. I thought he was an old family friend, but that's a long story that I refuse to get into at the moment. 

That's not possible this time, he's dead. So I don't know what the hell I would do if this turns out to be that again. Although the symptoms are not even close to being the same, I don't feel the overwhelming exhaustion I felt when I was sick the last time. I'm not vomiting or anything, just passing out. 

Wish me luck ladies and gentlemen.
