to quit the room
Friday during second period fear gripped me and I havn't been able to shake it

We were talking about the existence of God and the vastness that follows with that.. and I thought, for once, I really considered it, and it petrified me 

The terror consumed me and what kept me shaking throughout the day was not the bruising wind

The concept of an all powerful, all mighty, all knowing phsycotic being leaves me wanting to tremble on my knees and not priase him... but cower

I want to hide but I dont know where, and what's worse, I dont even know if it's real or not

I want to see a ghost or a miracle to validate all the claims the bible has made... but God is about faith not evidence so I can't ask for that

And than, of course, that evening right before I left with Randall to see some more local bands at a shitty venue, my father calls me up and condemns me for the allegations against me concerning drugs

He said he doesn't want to know if I've done it or not, but he wants me to be discreete in my dealings with anything.

And my mother, well, it's so awkward I cant stand being in the house

But I have no where to go, darkness has covered the sky and I have no where to go because Randall has finally convinced Torrey to go on a date and I'm left all alone

Left with fear for every patriach in my existence

... I really dont know what to do
