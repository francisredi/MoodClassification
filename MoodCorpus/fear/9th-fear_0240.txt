This place has changed me. I am afraid to leave my house. I am afriad to talk to people. I'm afraid that I am going to be robbed or killed if I do. Angela and I are fine. I just hate Colorado. 

Angela and I got a car the other day. A Nissan Sentra or something. It's nice and now we don't have to walk or take a cab anywhere. Angela put some of my stickers on it. I am afriad that it will attract attention, thieves, and vandalization. I am afraid that someone is going to stal the car. 

More and more famous people in the music industry are personally adding Bimpnotton (adding as in finding me and requesting an add) and thus, I am getting more support. I am afraid that I may get shot while performing for being a "fag". I am afriad that I will be even more paranoid if I end up getting famous and people start stalking me. I am afraid that my music will prevent me from taking care of my future family. 

I am afraid that Angela is going to get kidnapped, raped, beaten, or killed whenever she leaves to go to work. 





Being here has made me a frightened person.
