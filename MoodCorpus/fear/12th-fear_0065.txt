stupid guilty conciuos
So, yeah. I pretty much screwed myself over yesterday when it comes to wrestling states. I've had this thing lately about having a guilty conscious when I don't tell someone something they should know. And because of that I fricken screwed myself. So individual wrestling states starts next Thursday, the same day as our pre-festival concert. Well, my guilty conscious made me tell Mr. Stice that I wasn't going to go to the concert. Stupid, stupid, stupid! He basically told me that I couldn't go to states because band is a class and it is my responsibility to go to the concert. He said it in one of those serious scary voices too. I almost cried. I just wanted to scream at him, "I've waited 3 years to go to states and now you're telling me I have to go to the stupid concert instead!" I just shouldn't have told him and then not gone to the concert (I wouldn't be at school that day anyway). The worst part is that I haven't had him sign my prearanged absence form yet. So I think I'll just wait until next week to ask him. But now I'm stuck with a dilemma. I either have to 1 find someone who is driving over Friday morning and see if I can ride with them or 2 just leave on Thursday and not go to the band concert. I really don't know what I should do. Do any of you have and suggestions?
