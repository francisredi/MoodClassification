Panic attacks
from the reading I've done I've been having mild panic attacks for the last week.
I know what it is that initally set them off, but I had two and a half today (as in nearly had one in the morning and did have on in the afternoon) which had me kind of worried that I could have two in one day.

They are really scary.
Today Anthony had a go at people who were talking loudly during MoC and were staring in Shi, Fri, Azashi and My genreal area, normally I'd have had a go at him telling him we weren't taking, which we werent... surprisingly. Only instead I started getting very panicy and having trouble breathing, so I went outside to get more air. instead I was panicing more because it was an empty corridor which seemed to terrify me to the point of tears.
I'm kinda funny with the fact that I can't stand having people see me cry, Luckly... I'm pretty sure noone saw my tears.
after I calmed down a little Dan had come out because he was going home for the day, he tried to cheer me up thinking that it was the pressure of manifest that had got me upset, he's such a sweetie. Love to you Dan.

long story short I never want to have a panic attack again... I felt like I was going to stop breathing and die TT_TT I don't care for it at all
