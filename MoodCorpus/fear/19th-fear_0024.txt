too low to find my way, to high to wonder why
i start at the register tomorrow. i'm more than nervous. i don't know what i'm gonna be doing, i'm gonna feel so confused. i hate starting new jobs.

amazingly my mom remembered my birthday, but i still don't think i am getting anything since she didn't seem to care about what i wanted. i'll probably get money which is boring. i hate being old. i miss the old days when i was little and would open up tons of fun presents. meh.

worked on the mustang today, i underestimated the amount of grease that was going to be involved in replacing brakes. it was gross.

i got two new books today. an autobiography of danica patrick, the woman nascar racing who i so admire, since i would looove to race cars. and a long way down, which is about suicide. it's from the author of high fidelity which i loooove. 

so basically i'm stalling going to sleep cause i'm so nervous about work tomorrow. so i'm gonna stop writing.
