A poem called... My Death part 3
My heart was dying when I met you
A pain you could not take away
I don't know how to feel when you took me in your arms
This feeling I've never felt before surges through my body
I could feel my heart breaking with your every touch
Even as you whispered I love you I could feel the pain
Each sweet embrace tore it apart worse
How could something so wonderful hurt so much
You said you were mine, that I'd always be loved
You said you loved me, as you traced the knife across my back
I believed you even as I felt my skin being pierced
My heart was dying when I let you
Now, as I fall to my knees I feel it bleeding
This pain no one could take away
I look up at the person standing before me holding the knife
An all to familiar haunting face stares back at me
The eyes of a lover slowly go black
My life quickly disappears as my vision slowly fades
I reach up at the murderous person looking down at me
All I can feel is the cold, smooth feeling of the mirror in front of me
This was my life, Now its my death, Now its your pain.
