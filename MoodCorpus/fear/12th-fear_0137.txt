I feel helpless
My dad told me a couple months ago, out of the blue, that he's an alcoholic. And that his doctor called my stepmother and told her while she was out of town.  And she threatened to divorce him if he didn't stop. He went to AA for a while. He said he wasn't like them. That he could just stop.  She told me tonight that he's drinking again.  She said she'd warned him she'd divorce him.  I was furious. I raided his office while he was upstairs and found a bottle of scotch half empty under his desk. I dumped the whole thing in the sink and left it there for him to find. I hope he's fucking ashamed of himself tomorrow.  I've asked him about it, tried to make sure he never had a drink at dinner, tried to suggest he should be going to AA meetings.  And he's been fucking lying to me!  My stepmother has been there since I was seven.  My mother died when I was 17.  I'll be losing a parent if she leaves, PLUS the house we live in, PLUS my means of living right now, I'll have to quit school, and I don't know what else will happen. My dad will be depressed and I'm afraid of what he'll do.  So I'm sitting here crying and I don't fucking know what to do.  I feel like I'm watching him die.  I just. God. I don't fucking know what to do.
