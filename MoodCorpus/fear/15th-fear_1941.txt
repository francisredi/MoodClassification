Is it strange that I can tell when I'm up to late by the fact that I start unconsciously clenching my jaw?

Really wanna sleep, but must finish this dissertation review plan so it can be written, done and dusted in time for Doctor Who shenanigans tomorrow. If it isn't, then I am not going to let myself watch it, I'll download it and wait 'til my work is done and watch it as a reward. I must get up in the morning. I must have a productive weekend. If I don't, I really think I'm up shit creek without a paddle.

So what's with the sudden fear? It's this dissertation review I've just done. I just saw the author's Gannt chart and almost had a heart attack. Suggests that I am extremely behind. But I really don't know where else I could be right now. I have work coming out of my ears, I've been sticking to my schedule, there are people both ahead and behind me and the next month is going to be hell on a biscuit. So how the hell am I supposed to be doing literature reviews at te same blinkin' time? I can't tell you how much easier it would be if my dissertation deadline was the end of September... gah, if I start thinking like this now, I'll never go to sleep, or I'll start panicking and wibbling and not get anything constructive done because I'm too busy running round like a headless chicken.

Note to self: DON'T PANIC.

Work. Will finish by two. Up by nine, in the shower, working by ten.

God damn it.
