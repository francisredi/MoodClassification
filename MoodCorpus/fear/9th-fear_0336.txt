This is odd.  I want nothing more than my period to start, I begging to just damn bleed.
I'm so scared of being preganant, why am I even thinking about it?  I never imagined that I would be so inclined to have cramps and dirty underwear so bad in my life.  Just thinking about it makes me want to cry.  Why don't I feel anything starting?  Why can't I get a glimpse or reassurance.  I've taken the second placebo tonight, and my period usually starts before the first one.  I don't think I can take a pregnancy test, since the whole point of taking the Pill is to make your body act like it is pregnant.  Then again I could be worrying over nothing, and I am down on my knees praying that it is nothing.  Why can't I just not think about it?  Just not knowing what does what, we were really safe. Hell, there wasn't even stimulation and we didn't go more than two inches.  But what if it's one of those 'but it can still happen' cases?  We've already pledged to not even get close to anything like that for a very very long time.  We're both worrying a lot about this, and discussing our possiblities.  We both know, under no cicumstances, could I keep a baby.  I've been a supporter of abortion for this kind of reason.

My life would be so thouroughly fucked up if I were to have a child.  There isn't a way I could handle it, my emotional stablity has been cracking again, and I am very sure this would tip me over the edge again.

I'm scared.  I'm scared out of my damn mind.  I just feel like there's an empty nees where there should be heavyness.  There's nothing I can do, I just don't know anything.

I'm just so scared...

I just don't feel like I can sleep either.  It's just not in me tonight.
