Well day 2...
Hung out with friends for what will be one of th elast times. once i finish taking care of my debt I will dissappear, maybe for a while maybe for a logn while. My interest in energy arts is returning as well as an interest to strengthen my body. As I'm sacrificing my time with my friends this will allow me more time to devote to these projects.

I had intended on making an apology to someone today but he didn't show up and that makes me wonder if what I had said the other day did more damage than I could have fathomed. Oh well, shit happens and I'm doing my best to deal with it, I hoep he is as well. I'd like to apologize still though.

It's not easy being a somewhat oversensitive guy who does and says lots of stupid bullshit and doesnt realize it half the time. Well, thats something else I can work on. While I still feel I'm reverting to the angsty pissy teenager I used to be almost a decade ago, I'm smarter and wiser now. All I have to do is keep myself busy.

I think I need to find some film friends too. Oh well, day 2 is now over I skipped clas and my guts were sore and somewhat on fire as I was nervous as hell about making an apology.

We shall see how tomorrow goes.
