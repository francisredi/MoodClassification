Apparently the gods of mood neglected to inform me that they had scheduled a freaky fear meltdown for me today. Very inconsiderate of them not to warn me and allow me to adjust my plans accordingly.

I am usually more or less level headed. As I was working on my movie proposal and budget I began to think about my children, about how happy the band boys got over a simple pot of poutine, Delta trying to potty train herself, and the fact that I haven't made bread in almost a week. Suddenly trying to be a good enough parent, wife, and producing and directing a film seemed like more than I can manage. I had an overwhelming urge to drop out of school. I held in pretty well until Sweetpants got home and I had parcelled out snacks for the kids. Then I cried, freaked out for while (with the door closed).

Then I got a lecture about how I had kept him from selling his drums when he was about to give up on ever being a musician and he wasn't letting me give up on this.  I held everything together while he went to gradschool worked full time. It sounds good, and part of me thinks he's right, but another part of me thinks I'm going to fail in a big way. 

I don't know. I have until February 16th to get budgeting, a shooting schedule, and the script rewritten. Like a storm that appeared out of nowhere I am seized by panic that I cannot explain.
