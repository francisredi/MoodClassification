My life is a jumbled mess right now. I'm torn between the love i have for this one girl, and the love for this boy. this girl thinks I only care about her because of a part of her that I excepted. With or with out it I care about her. At this point in time i don't think it would be far for me to make a final choice. Besides I'll admit it I'm scared. I'm scared of losing both of them. To be honest I can't believe I'm writing this down. I wanted to tell this girl I care for her face to face with my own words but distance makes that impossible and every time I call her at a time she can talk or the stupid phone is shut off or my phone is being a pain. But this well have to do for now. I know she could be trying to move on with her life and find some one new and better but i have to tell her this. I'm on the fence here I can't choice one day I well but now is not the right time. I know I'm cowardly for not putting your name in here but as I said I'm a coward and nerves.
