What a strange strange existance.
I am all ups and downs.  Like a mini roller-coaster.  For a while I get happy, confident, and well..normal.  Then for a week here and there I get not sad but I feel strange.  I think right now that getting rejected from a few graduate schools has made me question my career choice.  I think I have a slight control problem.  I think when I start to feel that my life is in some aspects unpredictable I feel anxious.  I need to relax and enjoy life.  And I need to stay in contact with my friends.  I get so absorbed with my clay work and trying to secure this life that I have invisioned in my mind at all hours of the day that I fear that I am forgeting how to relax.  Portland was great.  I was far away from home so I just let loose and did everything on a whim.  It was great and I felt like my true self while I was there.  Then I get back here and go into automatic mode.  I NEED TO LET LOOSE!!!
