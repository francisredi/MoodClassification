Well, second day in a row where I'm not breathing comfortably
So I broke down and made an appointment with the new doctor. I looked online, and it can be anything from stress, to asthma. It's extremely hazy outside so that might be part of the problem. But I don't want to have too many more nights of sleeping upright with my troat tilted back so I can breathe. Especially since I know, I KNOW, a spider will drop down into my mouth and say "HEy! This is a pretty happing pl--------" oops tummy spider. 

Even work is difficult cuz it feels like I've got a marble stuck in my throat and I keep gagging. So I'm not sure if some toof chip got stuck in there and is irritating the breathing bits of the throat (larynx pharynx whateverthehellynx), or if its asthma, or perhaps even some sort of sinus infection. I might be that, even if it doesn't seem to be pouring out of me, only because my mouth tastes like week old snot. EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW.

Will know tomorrow of the am. I guess I should make a list of my aches and pains to truly beat this poor doctor into the ground before she has a chance to realise she hates me. Yeah.

On the bright side, my tooth has subsided into mere discomfort/itching, which means all the skin is healing nicely around the toof, so that it's gonna rip REAL good when they take the temp crown its attached to off and ram some piece of toliet bowl on it. 

No really, Porcelain: Toliet bowls, teeth. Same stuff. If I get enough of that stuff in my mouth, I can skip the toothpaste and go straight into Tidybowl. My breath will smell like lily of the valley and ammonia. Word!

The right side of my mouth is higher than the left side now, so I can't chew still. Oh well.
