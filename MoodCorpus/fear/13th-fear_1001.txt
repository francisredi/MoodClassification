It's strange, but I really HATE this part...
I'm bad at ice-breaking, terrible at flirting, and deeply nervous on first dates. Always have been; I'm much better with spontaneous hooking up at parties or dating people who were friends first.

Which is why I'm both elated and nervous right now, because I just got the number of someone local from OKCupid who seems to be my type. (, you might remember when I first saw her profile at Goffee; yeah, her) I don't care if her pretext was rather flimsy; she gave me her number. ("OKCupid is running slow for me, so why don'tcha just call me?" sounds like a flimsy pretext rather than a reason, dunnit?)

It's just so hard to relax and be myself at first, for me. And it's been such a long time since anybody's been all that interested (with the courage to also let me know they're interested) who was even 50% my type (believe me, I'm not holding out for perfect!) that it'll only exacerbate the situation.

It'd be wrong to say "I don't know what I should do," but that's sort of what's going through my head. I think I'm wishing someone could wave a wand over my head and make me into a suave motherfucker, but let's be realistic here; the best I can hope for is some good advice from trusted friends...
