Complicated life
Like four weeks ago Kyle left me because I told him about my past and I have just recently realized how bad our relationship was to start with.  For one thing I wasn't really in love with Kyle, I was just projecting my feelings for somebody else on to Kyle because I didn't think that the man I loved could love me back.  Well, he told me he was in love with me like a week ago without knowing how I felt for him.  I made my confession and then left decisions up to him.  Then he shows up last night and I ended up doing something kind of shitty.  I slept with him, the guy I have been in love with for 11 months now, but the big problem is not that I slept with him but that he has a girlfriend.  I feel so upset with myself because I've never done anything like this before.  I have better expectations of myself after everything I've been through, but I missed him and I wanted at least one chance to be with him and now I don't know how things are going to turn out.  Does he really love me?  Is he going to leave her for me?  Is it going to come out that all he wanted was a one night stand?  Am I going to get my heart broken again?  All these things are running through my mind.  I mean I trust him, but I don't trust myself.  For a woman who has been through everything I have trust is a hard thing to obtain and hold onto, but he has my trust.  And yet I am scared of how everything is going to turn out.  I fear for my heart it has been crushed under so many people's feet before and I do not know if I can take it again.  I have been used, abused, and hurt by so many that it scares me when I fall for someone else because I don't know how to act at first and then I don't know how things are going to turn out.  I love him and I am scared of my feelings and that's what I can't understand.  Ok, I'm going to stop whining and get back to the real world.  Till later the crow sits in wait for the return of the dead. Dia De Los Muertos.
