ive bee feeling very shitty lately(for the past two days). some tears here and there. i believe it was triggered by yesterdays chain of events which went something like this.

NOTE: i have a very irrational and intense fear of spiders and i consequently have a phobia of basements and narrrow dark places or dense bushes and anyplace else a spider could happen to be so while some of the following events may seem...well...stupid(and in retrospect i feel that it is as well) at the time i was rather terrfied.

my mother and i went shopping together which means she was bitchy on the way to the store, during the trip, and back. on the way back she bot guilt tripped me about money and me not having a job and once again described how much stress she's under in great detail.for some reason(guilt?? anger?? pressure??) i was already on the verge of tears but i was holding them back because i felt i had really no reason AND i hate crying when i have no reason because people always expect you to explain. we got home and as i was opening about to open the door to the house i realised as my eyes focused and adjusted in front of me(it was dark)that there was an enormous spider appoximately 4in in front of my face...damn it.

 to be continued when my mother isnt asking me what my problem is.
