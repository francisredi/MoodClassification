seriously, this is annoying

im tired all day, every day, due to the fact that i wake up at 4:45 am for my job.
then the second i turn off the light and hit the pillows for real, my brain won't turn off, i get anxious, and nervous, and think about everything i can't fix and anything that doesn't matter.
i really wish this could stop so i could get more than 4 hours of sleep a night. 

im glad i started classes again, but im already stressed by them.  the main stress is just the busy schedual though.  rushiing back and forth between work and school and more work. I also go such good grades last semester that im already pressuring myself to match those again.  

and i need more fun.  i need more opportunities to just throw back my head and have a true honest laugh and good time.
i need more people that im super comfortable around
i miss having a super tight girl friend that i could tell all my secrets and stuff to face to face, rather than though phone coversations over state lines.
and i need more hugs!
