Later - Same day
I had to get a new cell phone today.&nbsp; My cell phone is so unreliable right now - at a time when I need to have contact with people.
Also, the house phone rang at 4 am this morning.&nbsp; I thought, the way the guy sounded, that it was "THE" call.&nbsp; It woke me up and I wasn't able to completely go back to sleep because of my nerves. My stomach is all upset again and my head is dizzy again.&nbsp; Yes, I'm eating.&nbsp; No, I'm not sleeping well.&nbsp; Can I just go to sleep and wake up when this is over.&nbsp; I TOTALLY get that parents are supposed to die and leave their kids.&nbsp; I just don't think I'm going to handle it well when mine go - whenever that may be.&nbsp; I'm worried about the secondary issues BESIDES the burns that's going to affect him.&nbsp; The nurses all agree that he's "ok" and "stable" but why not the word I want to hear most "improving" or "doing great".&nbsp; I'm calling my friends too much and I really don't have much to say.&nbsp; I feel like I'm whining and bothering them too much because all I have to say is the same thing over and over... he's the same.&nbsp; But really, there are little things that either encourage me, or mostly discourage me.&nbsp; And that's all it's taking... a little thing to mess with my emotions.&nbsp; I see people walking around the nurses station and I want him to do the same thing... walk or wheel or limp, I don't care.&nbsp; Geez, insult the doctors and pick on the nurses - just DO SOMETHING in the way of improving and getting out of that bed.&nbsp; Monday - after that, we'll know more.&nbsp; I'm scared about Monday.
