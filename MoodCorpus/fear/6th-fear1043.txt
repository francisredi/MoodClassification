what was i thinking....?
what the hell was i thinking? earlier i took a friends advice and told "him" that i still like him. (i sent him a text bcz i can nvr get ahold of him on the phone and we c eachother for like 2 minutes total a day). i sent it to him at like 2:30 and it is now 7:15 and i still haven't heard back from him. in the text i said, 
    "Hey, whats up? There is something that i have been wanting to tell u but keep chickening out. U have probably figured this out by now, but i still really like u. I dont kno what i expect by telling u this, except for u to tell me if u still like me or not. I spend a lot of time wondering if u still like me too. I am sry about anything stupid i have said or wrote to u that i shouldnt have in the past few months. I am not asking for us to go back out bcz i realize that u r really busy and that u probably dont like me, i just want to kno. Please answer me with the truth as soon as u can and dont let this make it any more awkward between us than it already is. (note: what the hell was i thinking, dont let this make it anymore awkward than it already is? i will b suprised if i can even look at him tomorrow) I dont expect a 6 page answer by the way lol. o yhea, and i will pay u back for these if u want. Well, i'll ttyl. ~trish~"
    again, what the hell was i thinking? i feel so stupid! i can not believe that i sent that! it makes it worse that i still havent heard back from him.  i want to just curl up and die, and i havent even heard back from him. it is gonna b so awkward tomorrow at school since we both work in the concession stand...i have never felt so stupid in my life! on a happier note, i fixed my webcam finally...oh yhea, and i have a science fair project due on monday that i havent even started on.
