Whew!
It has been one heck of a week, and it's only Tuesday! I went back to work on Monday, which kind of sucked because I was tired and a little bit achy still, but...! I GOT THE JOB! I GOT THE JOB! I GOT THE JOB! And still can hardly believe it! In two weeks I'll be a Sr. LTA (library technical asst), have health benefits (already do, but it's through the family business, atm O.o), vacation time, sick time, holiday pay, get to use the Uni gym, plus get an almost 10k a year raise!!! *boggle* It's like...a real job and stuff!!! *grin* Seriously, I'm still just falling over myself here.

Then this morning, it was really cold here (remember, this is FL, really cold is in the low 30s, which almost never happens), I went outside to leave for work, and not only was there frost on the grass, there was ice on my fucking car! Like, really real ice, on the windshield and back window! That didn't just brush off! It was awesome! :P

Finally, I really hate to do this, but I'm going to make something public, because I have to do something about it. I have to lose weight, since I recently found out that I'm well on my way to Type 2 Diabetes. Not gonna go there. I've see-saw dieted for the last 3 years and, everytime I re-gain, I get just a little bit worse. Fuck me if I know how this even happened. *shrug* So, me and my mom are doing the Zone diet right now, and I've lost 4 lb in just about a week. It's...interesting, actually. I like it. I've done WW before, but gonna give this a shot. So...here goes.



Sorry to blab so much! Now, must sleep! Oh! Happy Valentine's Day, everyone!
