i finally started seeing myself through your eyes.
i'm soooo addicted to myspace. 

i had an awesome day, well most of it was awesome anyway. i met rick the temp! he did like a motivational speaker thing at my school and i just absolutely fell in love all over again. he's even cuter in person. he has perfect skin. swoon. i hung around for a while after school and took some myspace pics with my flatmates. i love sophie kinsella novels so i've decided to call my best friends my flatmates... it'll pass. thennnn went to so's and read some magazines. i stole a magazine with fall out boy on the cover. peter is cute. then i was supposed to go to youth... i brought my bible and everything. i was going to do it and then i got into an arguement with my dad and he made me come home. so i didn't end up going to youth. is it a sign? i've been listening to an awesome hillsongs cd and i really want to go... but i'm so scared about opening myself up to all that again. i do miss God though and i have been very distanced from him for a long time now... maybe that's why i'm so nervous but i get a terrible feeling in my stomach and i'm not ready to be back in that atmosphere. it's a huge deal. 

ah i need sleep. love.
