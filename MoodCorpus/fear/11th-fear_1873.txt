I am so nervous.
I am so nervous.


As of mid February, I have been in the process of applying to Wayne State's Masters in Theatre Costuming program.  I have submitted my application to the master director, and on the 7th of March, I have my interview, where I will submit my portfolio, my pieces, be interviewed.

I am so nervous.

I haven't even had the fucking interview and I'm NERVOUS!!!  I want this, it's perfect.  It's so me.  The craziness of theatre costuming, no demographic, no set ideas, I'm designing for a person that doesn't exist yet, not until they are created.  I love it.  The rush of getting and entire costuming build out in a few weeks, then just watching it.

The fact that I'm starting to care so much, that I am worrying, I can't eat that well, I'm not sleeping.  Until I know it's mine, I won't.  Its right there and I can't have it yet.

I want this, so much.  And I'm so nervous.
