Ponderings on the NYC thing
My phone interview with NYPL is tomorrow at 2:00 (either Central or Eastern - I'm not sure).  So the stress of all that aside, the interview is tomorrow, and I'm nervous.  I don't know why.  I wasn't nervous with ASU (whom I have not heard back from yet, but don't expect to until this week sometime), so I don't know why I'm nervous with the NYPL.  Maybe I actually really want a job there.  I did find a cute apt. for around $800 in northern Brooklyn (utilities included).I've gotten one of two reactions to the thought of me in NYC.1)  "Oh, wow.  How exciting.  That would be a great job."  And to those people, I say thanks for your support.2)  "You do realize how expensive it is to live there, right?"*  No.  I had no idea the cost of living would be higher in one of the biggest cities in the country than in small town Wisconsin.  No, I've never seen, nor heard, anything that would give me the idea that the cost of living in NYC is high.  I research things and get paid for it - of course I know how high the cost of living is in NYC.  I have family there.  One of my old roommates is from Long Island.  I am familiar with the money issues living in NYC might provide.  *This is the family reaction.  I don't think they like the idea of me moving to the coast. As an aside, I haven't even had the interview.  So, I don't know if I even have a job there.  If I get a job there, I don't know where it would be or what I'd be doing.  And the starting wage for new librarian hires in the PL system is not as bad as some make it out to be.  My standard of living would probably go up - one of the plusses of being in poverty now.I got to relieve my stress a little this weekend by playing with Bear and Pugsy.&nbsp; They are on diets, so Bear is a little cranky, but Pugsy has more energy.&nbsp; I have little pieces of them with me on my scarf, coat, sweater, etc.&nbsp; How I love dog hair.
