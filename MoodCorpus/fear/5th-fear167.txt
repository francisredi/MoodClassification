Love is the most unnerving feeling I can imagine.  I've been in very strange situations as some of you know, but none have been more terrifying than love.  Two years ago, my life ended.  Everything I breathed for fled from me within less than a day.  I couldn't bear to live without those that made my life what it had become.  I despretly tried to hold onto Jeremy, but he slipped away.  I lost myself.  I refused to let anyone have even part of my heart.  I had nothing left to give.  I felt like I had fallen from the only heaven I had ever known, with no chance of regaining it.  To this day, I still hope Jeremy and I will find our way back together.  I still pray that he will realize all he is to me and that I am equally part of him.  But today I found myself in a new situation.  I asked God for something else.  I asked God for someone else.  I feel so close to this person and yet so far away from him.  I can't even type his name so as not to jinx it or upset him.  I don't really know how he feels and I'm not sure he knows how he feels.  I've only asked God for one thing in my life, Jeremy.  And today it felt just as right to ask God for this man.  Jeremy drifted through my life briefly and taught me things I never would have learned otherwise.  Maybe this person will do the same.  Maybe he is what I have been prepapared for.  I've known him for a long time now and still am every bit as intrigued by him as the day we first met, maybe more so.  I want him to know what I have posted here and on my xanga.  But I don't want to tell him directly.  He will read it when the time is right.  Something will tell him to read these pages.  I'm regaining faith in fate and in love.  I've never been more scared in my life.  Wish me luck.
