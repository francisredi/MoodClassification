What does tomorrow bring?
Tomorrow at 4:45pm I will be sitting in a cold Dr office.  A new Doctor, a special doctor, a man who will be playing a hudge roll in my life.  Tomorrow I see Dr Steven Nozetz, my endocranolgist. I am not sure how to feel or what to think.  I am scared!  Whats he going to say?  Whats he going to do?  Is it going to hurt?  How am I going to take care of myself and my kids?  I have so many unknowns and I know tomorrow I will have many answers and alot of information to process. 

I have the most amazing story.  So tonight I told Bob was I going to Henerys for fruit and while I was driving I decided to go to Target.  I really had no reason to go but I went.  So I am just walking around and I hear mama look its Ms. Ellen.  OK so I have not been Ms. Ellen in years, since I was at the Y.  Here was this little boy well not so little anymore he is almost 7 that I use to teach FOUR years ago.  So we were talking and let me tell you she looks GREAT and I had said somthing turns out she has Prolactnoma WHAT I HAVE.  The only thing was hers in cancer.  DON'T FREAK! There is such a small chance of it being cancer less then 5%.  Well as she is talking I started to cry I didn;t mean to but I did.  She goes no no its ok I am ok and I am happy and this has taught me to live and be happy.  I said no no you don;t understand.  I just found out that I have two tumors.  She just hugged me as we stood in the middle of Target crying and hugging.  WE exchanged numbers and I think she is going to become a GREAT friend.  There was a reason for me to go to Target tonight.  I didn;t walk out with any bags but I did walk out with a tear in my eye and a smile on my face.
