It's official now. My mother has been diagnosed with dementia. Her doctor is running some more tests to fine tune the diagnosis and then he'll put her on meds. There aren't any that can reverse the damage, but they can stop the progression. God I hope they work. Because I really don't think any of us could take it if she ended up like my grandmother.  She already has trouble following the thread of conversations and has delusional thoughts of doom--- mostly involving us going to jail for child abuse and neglect and income tax evasion.

  I don't feel safe leaving Maddie in her care any more and sometimes I feel like I don't have the patience to take care of my child and my mother. My father is the one that does most of the managing with my mother but he gets kind of flaky about things, so a lot of time I end up having to manage his management.

  I don't really have a choice anymore.  I have to be the strong level-headed one in this household.  And god it's exhausting me.
