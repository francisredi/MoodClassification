Well, the whole thing is over with myself and David.  I wish that it could have worked out, but sometimes a marriage cannot work out if thre is nothing there.  I love him, but there is more to a marriage then love.  Through this whole divorce there has only been one person that can completely comfort me.  He makes me feel happy, he always just seems to know how to place a smile on this asian face.

It's kinda weird how we met and how we just completely clicked with each other.  I'm not going to lie, when I first met him I thought he talked way too much, but Igot over it. He's pretty much just like me, which is awesome!  It's so hard to find someone you completely connect with.  He's a great friend.  Now if you ask me will he ever be more than a friend?!  I'm not sure about that.  There are just so many things stopping me from having those kind of feelings for him.  But then there is that one feeling that makes me wanna risk it all, but I'm going to be smart about this, I've made so many wrong decisions in my life that I just want to start making the right ones for myself.  Hopefully though the whole wrong decisons it wont prevemt mme from making another wrong mistake by not letting someone completely into my life because I'm trying to be smart.  I dunno...Idunno how I feel, but I do...I dunno if that makes sense, but oh well, I don't care, it makes sense in my head!  lol.  Anyways, I'm gonna go now.

I will try to start and update this thing on a regular basis now!
