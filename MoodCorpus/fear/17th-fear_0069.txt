It would be a good day to be pregnant
I don't feel very well. Physically and, well, you know. I have a bad cold, probably from wearing summer clothes this week end, thinking I can handle the freezing temperature like I use to. But I'm tired these days, and I should have been careful. Yesterday, JM called. I couldn't answer. The fact that he called me put me in such rage (I don't know why), that I litteraly whished him to go to hell. I don't know. I think his story is this great lie just to get to sleep with me. Maybe he's smarter than I thought. Anyway I don't want to deal with him right now, I'm too tired. Actually I'm afraid : I fear that something bad is about to happen to me. It's weird, as if my dreams are preparing me to face this huge wave, but I'm not getting any stronger, and my physical weakness won't welp at all. I need people around me, a lot, people who will say they don't care about my mistakes, people who will love me no matter what I do or look like. I need my friends to be there for me right now. i want to be with them so much I could cry. You know what? I know what I'm afraid of, now, I'm afraid of loosing my friends; and here's the weird part: I afraid that they'll leave me soon.
