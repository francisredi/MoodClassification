Tomorrow
Im having surgery tomorrow. Im pretty nervous about it even though its not a major surgery or anything. They have to take a cyst out of my wrist and close up a hole that caused the cyst to start with. They arent putting me to sleep, I'll be away the whole time but numbed up and drugged. Im only taking one day off work too haha! I might have a workaholism problem since I was supposed to take off two weeks! Jackie's pretty pissed because I cant lifeguard on the weekend but I dont care, there isnt much I can do about it. Plus, I lifeguard every damn weekend for her even though I told her I didnt want to do it anymore so she can bite me... I feel so loved because all my friends said they were going to come bring me food and movies and keep me company. I have to make them appointments haha! Rian is coming in the morning, Karlin is coming in the afternoon after school, and AJ and Mike are coming in the evening after work lol! Im going to have company all day long. The only one I really want to come over though is Karlin. Not that I dont want my other friends to come, its just that I want Karlin to come most of all because she's good at making me feel better and we can watch The Sweetest Thing!!!
