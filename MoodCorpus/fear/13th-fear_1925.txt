Vanessa can not.
The future scares me, this is probably a very healthy fear, but none the less it is my fear at the moment.  Grad school. Finishing my Undergrad.  the next 5 years, the next 10 years, eternity.  it can seem so opressive, but like a member of AA (Artists Anon) i kinda just have to take it one day at a time.

does anyone here have any hints on how to look into finding a suitable grad school?

does anyone know if i will ever not get estatic because i got new (non goodwill) pants, due to new (non goodwill) pants being such a rarity?

does anyone know if i will be ok?

i think i will at least be ok.

well, now the TV is putting up that little dot that says "whoaaaa, it's time to turn of the telly, and go to bed."  *makes like a hippy and goes to bed*

p.s. Xauf (patrick), bar of soap, perry ave, monday night.

p.s.s. i seem to have inh erited dad's sleep apnea..this means i really need to go to sleep clinic, he has this kind where your soft pallette like closes off your airway, apparently this raises your blood pressure and can give you a heart attack.  i need to lose weitght, and exorcise my throat (not like that)...and maybe i can use this as an excuse to finaly get a breast reduction (people who don't know me might not be aware that i have huge huge boobies.)
