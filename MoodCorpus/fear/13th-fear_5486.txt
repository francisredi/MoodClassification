the shear agony
He's home, he's in my 8th hour. I spent all day agonizing him being home and I never see him throughout the day. Then hes in my fucking 8th hour study hall 3 times a week. I lost it, I completely lost it. Sally basically had to help me control everything i was feeling. The anger, the sadness, the stupidity, the hate, the lost friendship, and broken promises... they emotions came all at once. Nobody really understands the pain and agony i was going through. (Em might understand). It kills me, I dont have feelings for him anymore of that nature, but it still hurts, i'm scared of him. He knows exactly what to do and say to make me completely putty and be able to fuck with my mind. I dont want to go through those games. The sad thing is if they start, i'm pretty sure Casey won't have my back. LIke he won't stand up and protect me. Casey's the knight in shining armor or is suppose to be, Nick's the big bad wolf who will eat me. Sad. Just sad thats all I can say. 4th quarter shall be interesting, wish someone would give me advice on what to do. Got anything... help me!
