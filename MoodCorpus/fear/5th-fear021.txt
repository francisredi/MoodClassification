im scared
im scared i dont know if i can handle everything that is happening i have three weeks coming up of classes where i leave the house at six in the mornign and dont get out of class at night until ten i dont know when i am going to have time to get all of my homeowrk done i dont know if ill be able to make it to class on time becasue i have twenty minutes to get from my school all the way to occ on a bike which is a trip that takes me twenty minutes from my house and it takes at least ten fifteen minutes to get from my school to my house the end of the semester is coming and with it finals are also coming my future depend upon the actions that i take this year no one in my family has dont what i have done i have the ability to go to just about any school that i want to as long as i can get the grades as well as acheive the rest of what i need to do this year such as scolarships and such i hate that there is so much pressure on me to do all that i can to make it my grandma raised me and so she tells me all the time that i am going to make it and that this is the year that i have to start applying for scholarships and i know this but it seems like if i dont make it then it will affect her becasue i was the first female that she raised and so what happenes to me is a reflection on what she does so if i fail then she fails that is what many parents think that actually take part in thier childrens future or at least that is what i am assuming she tells me that she will support me in whatever i do and yet sometimes i dont believe that that is true becasue she wants me to have soo much she took a different path and she did not have a whole bunch of oppurtunities so it is like she is putting her hopes and dreams all on me i dont know what i am going to do and i dont know how i am going to deal with all of this in a way it scares me actually i am completly scared there are so many times that i juat want to crawl into a corner and tell myself that everything is ok and that there isnt all of this stress that is going on i hate it that i am crying my future scares me i dont know what is going to happen i dont know where i am going and i dont know what i am going to do in life it seems like the whole rest of my life rests on this time right now what am i going to do ...
