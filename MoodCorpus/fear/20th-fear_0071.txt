I'm leaving my house tomorrow morning at like 8 to go to RVC so that I can get on a bus for camp.  I know I'm only going to be gone for almost three days but I am going to miss the people that aren't coming with alot.  I hopefully this summer won't be as lame as I think it is going to be.

This weekend I found out some good news and some not so good news. The guy I like likes me, but we aren't going to date. Knowing this person as well as I do i can completely understand why.  The only thing I don't get is why the past matters so much. I mean I see why it matters but it shouldn't as much as it does. Plus on the other hand things are alot different now. I just want us to be together. I think I might like it better if we were dating but if he doesn't feel that way then I am fine with being just friends I guess. I seriously just don't know what I would do without him....I really want to kiss that boy but I am scared I will get hurt. I know i can trust him and I know he wouldn't lie to me. I just got hurt last time and I don't want to again but if I do, I think he's worth it.

Last night I had a bonfire at my house which was so much fun..I bet Jordan's boy friend Connor last night and he fits in with us very well. I'm sure he is scared of me because any time he has ever seen me I've been 
super hyper.

Today Jordan came over and we walked to Hoffman to meet Connor. I was in a really good mood today. I'm sure Jordan seemed a little irritated when I was taking pictures of them, but she knows she loves those pictures
