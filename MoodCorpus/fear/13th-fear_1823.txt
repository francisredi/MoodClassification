Domestic life
So I found out today that Jason's grandmother is coming to stay with us next saturday evening into sunday morning.  Jason is taking her to the bus station early sunday morning where she will travel back to Grandmother Land: a very small town in western PA where she has a cat.

I am very apprehensive about this matriarchal visit.  She is a little woman...perhaps 4'11" in high heels, with a gruff voice, smoking too many cigarettes with a desire to complain about everyone and everything.  But she loves her grandson, and she is nice to me.  I just don't know what we will do with her all evening!  What the hell will we talk about?  Other than being Jason's grandmother, we don't have anything in common.  We've already gone through the usual catch up conversations through recent visits.  I'm afraid we will sit there staring at each other.  Thank god for the cats!  We can always just watch them and talk about them all night :) Hell, that's not an unusual evening in our house anyway.

So I've begun the "House Cleaning: Grandmother Edition".  This includes dusting the knick knacks and the tops of picuture frames on the walls.  It'll take me all week as Jason and I aren't the most tidy people in the world.  Right now I have so much dust up my nose that everything smells like old books.
