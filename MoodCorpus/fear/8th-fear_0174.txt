ok so this week i am MAD hungry , cant get enough to eat!!!! that is all i want to do night and day!!!!!

also i am nervous now , i am getting my u/s done when i am 18 weeks 3 days but i am hearing horror stories about woman being told that the gender can not be seen before 20 weeks! my ob sent me specifically for anatomy and to find out the sex (my dr i guess is a rarity and knows the sex even when the parents dont! they code it and put it on the charts! even if the parents arent finding out) so, im skeeered! I WANT TO KNOW! i want to know if its a MORE pink OR MORE blue around here!!!!
 i cant rememever how far along i was with my other two ultrasounds... i cant imagine that i was much later then 18 weeks since this is pretty typical of my ob!!!  :(  i just hope that they can tell...

well i am off to EAT more and try and sleep!  anyways one week from today... well today is over so 6 days!!!!!!!!

belly shot!!!   this was me at 17 weeks!!! im 17 3days now!!!!
