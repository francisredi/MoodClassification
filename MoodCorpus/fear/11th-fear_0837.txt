So this may be it. Last night she came over because sergie didn't pick her up at work. SO she called me and had me pick her up. We watched some athf episodes and she fell asleep on my couch. At around 1 she woke up and told me to take her home. I asked her if she would spend the night since it was so late and because we both had a few drinks, but she got angry at me. She was angry because she was going to go to sergie's. I felt hurt, so very hurt. She continues to throw me away for someone that she knows she has no real future with. I can't let her do this anymore. I can't let her continue to see me, then lie to me and go see him right after. It is wrong to do that for so long to me. She has already slept with him and we have only been apart for a short period of time. 

So I told her she needs to make a decision because I am dying inside everyday. Friday she has off from work and I told her we can either spend the day together talking about things, or we can bring all of her stuff to her place. I am so scared she is going to throw me away for an infatuation. I really can't believe this is happening.

I called her this morning and asked her to call me before she goes to work. I'm sure she slept over at sergie's so she probably won't call me. She is hurting me so very bad. I may have made mistakes, but i never treated her like this. I never would because I love her so much. God, I pray that she does not throw me away.
