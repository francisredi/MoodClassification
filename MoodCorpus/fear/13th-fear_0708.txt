I can feel it
I can feel this guilt and pain growing stronger and stronger.  I can feel myself push it away, as if on instinct.  Like I don't even realize it.  I don't want to deal with it.  Not now.  I know it will get worse, but I don't know what to do yet.  I messed up twice.  I can't face them twice.  I can't be forgiven twice.  I can feel it.  I can literally feel it, but it hasn't broken the surface yet.  One day I will break, and it'll be soon, and I'll regret all of this.  I already regret everything.  I regret the person I am.  I regret having no motivation, and I regret being lazy.  I regret having no dreams, and I regret putting everything off.  I regret putting myself through this pain.  I regret putting everyone else through pain because of it.  I hate myself.  I want to be happy agian.  I want to love myself, and love my life.  I want to be able to take a deep breath and look up at the sky with a smile.  I can feel this growing.  I don't want this to get worse.
