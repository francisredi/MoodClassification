Sometimes...
I wonder sometimes. I feel so unsure, so afraid, terrified that everything I have, my dreams and my love, are going to just slip through my fingers. My mother was screaming at me today about AP Comp, that I'm not taking it anymore, about how I'm such a failure and so shameful to the family. That I don't deserve to be related to them...
It couldn't have come at a worse time, with Dave's words still in my head, mocking me, tearing at me. I spent an hour talking to Cheryl about it just so I could calm down. I don't know what to do. I'll be so sure one moment, then I'll turn around and watch my world fall apart around me. I can't lose this, I can't lose him, I just can't... But it's not my choice.
"Choice is only an illusion...", if it's only an illusion then why am I forever being screamed at for mine. I don't understand. I'm so afraid. I need a hug, really bad before I reach for those blasted safety pins.
