Yo!
Well, tomorrow is the big doctor appointment.  I'm uber-nervous about it.  I don't like having cold metal shoved up me and I don't want to find out I have some disease.  Not like an STD but PCOS.  If I do have it, I'll have to change my eating habits and that's always the suckage.  But I guess the sooner I find out, the sooner I can get better and stop feeling tired all the time.  Even my boss asked if I was ill because my skin is so pale.  Suppose if I was still into the goth scene, I'd be happy to be this pale.

All-in-all, I'm feeling better.  Not 100% but better than I had.  I'm still exhausted and I still get dizzy spells, but not like before.  And the head cold from Hell is finally gone.  I guess I should be happy about that but I still worry.  I'm always worrying about stuff I shouldn't worry about.

According to the poll I did about my new layout, CSI is the winner with Wes/Angel coming in a close second.  I had a CSI header but when I went to upload it, it was way too small.  *sigh*  I spent a good two hours looking around for a new one but can't find one.  *emos*  I did find a cool Catherine mood theme.  Wish I knew someone who made headers.  Would love a Catherine one to go with the mood theme.  I'm not very good with graphics or I'd make one myself.

I finally got my Wes/Lilah fic finished for a ficathon and it's been sent off for beta.  It's not due until April but I want to get it up and done with.  I ended up signing up for another ficathon today.  It's a drabble of less than 400 words.  I can handle that.

God, wish I wasn't such a bundle of nerves right now.  *sigh*
