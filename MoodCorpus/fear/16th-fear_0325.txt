SHIT
Well...still lots of stuff going on - but don't have enough energy to write about it.  My mom's blood sugar dropped to below 20 last night. =(. I'm not sure that of those that actually read my journal, if anybody knows what "normal" is and stuff. Read if ya want  FREAKIN SCARY shit. what's also scary is that it was just luck that my dad happened to go check on my mom at the time (when she was convulsing on the bed). It scares me so freakin' much. I'm half in denial, and half scared so much I can't move. What if last night was worse? I don't know how I would have handled it. Makes ya think, ya know? Since the transplant - it's like....we've all been slightly happier and better and stuff, and I forget how things were horrible for so long. I don't want to go back to that. At all. =(. And then my dad is leaving this weekend, but I already have some plans I can't break, and I'm scared shitless. That's pretty much the whole of it. I'm just scared scared scared and feel helpless.

Okay, I just really needed to vent and stuff. I'm gonna go watch some Veronica Mars, 'cause it always cheers me up.
