Confused
I'm so confused everything is driving me crazy. I just feel like disappearing before anything else happens. My friends are fighting and I with one of them but I don't like being mad at people unless I have both sides of the story, but I don't feel like asking since my friend did something I really hate he said that he wanted to go out with someone and he really did not want to, and that's what my ex-boyfriend did to me when we dated and he dumped me at the end of the year I still feel a little hurt, but I'm over it, and the other thing is I'm nerves about my grades in math I'm not understanding Algebra II and I'm giving myself headache at school and when I get home I don't want to think about homework and I'm so tired of all this and I wish the world would just stop for 2 days and let my head find its way back. I just don't know what to do anymore. Maybe I'm going crazy, really crazy, Could I be right?
