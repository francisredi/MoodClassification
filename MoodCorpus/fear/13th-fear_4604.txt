last night i spent a few hours looking through the breast reduction community on lj. ell and i have been having a little confusion with our insurance plan (we're still listed as blue cross california but it won't give us doctors for portland on the website even when we've logged in with our membership number) but i need to call and get that figured out because... 
i am actually going to make an appointment for a consultation with a plastic surgeon.
this is a huge step for me and i am scared to death. for one, i'm worried that i won't get the reduction covered by my insurance (meaning i can kiss it goodbye and say hello to back pain for a few more years) two, the surgery is fucking gnarly and invasive and i'm going to have to take some time off work/life for it. another concern is support (pun intended!). i don't really have many close friends in portland yet, and i'm going to need people with me after the surgery, especially the first week. i've thought about buying my best friend chasidy (the one in SC) a plane ticket out here because she's been through similar recovery - she actually had implants done a few years ago. anyway. nervous. the money thing would definitely hold me back more than the surgery itself. this is something i really want/need to do and sooner will be better than later.
