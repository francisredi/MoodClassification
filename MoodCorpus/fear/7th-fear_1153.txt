Lockdown
What a day.  This past thursday, as I was reviewing a lesson with half of my students, and the other half was taking a test while the horrible alarm went on. I have been in a fire drill before in the same school and I did not recognized that alarm sound. My first graders silently got up and started getting in line, but one of them was really scared and started crying out loud, he started running and getting under neat his desk. I did not know what to do and the first thing I said was "this is not a fire alarm, calm down, there is no fire... nothing is going to happen, go back to your seats and wait for directions..." As soon as I said that, the Principal made an announcement "this is a lock down, please lock your doors, all students return to your classroom immediately". The first time I experience a lock down was during my first week substituting and I remember being really scared. I guess is a common thing here in the city of San Bernardino. Anyways the students had to eat lunch inside the classroom, and we got to play inside. After we ate I explained that it is ok to be scared and to cry, and that -it is not ok. to laugh at people. I also told them that we need to stay calm, and  not run around like crazy because that can create more problems. The rest of the day went smooth and I got to finish all my testing.
