My Film.....
I must express to this journal the massive anxiety I had before I filmed my short film.  I wish I had more time and money, and because I did not have those things I wanted to make sure I worked really hard a shot something that was GOOD and WORTH IT...seeing as this is what i'll have to show for myself when trying to break into the industry as a director.  Gosh it was almost torture.  It made me think...do I really want this as a career if I'm going to be this nervous?  Before I shot, I decided YES.  Because there were many things other than just the film that made me nervous.  I was my own producer and everything so I had to make sure it was all coming together and working, AND worry about the creative content and the actors.  WHEW.  I'd say I did a decent job.  I still think I could have done better, but for the time and money I am confident in my hard work.  

Now that the major stress is over, I can't let myself slip in the editing process.  Editing and music and sound is SOOOO important.  I must get on the ball with this next week and start getting nervous again.  Nervousness is pushing me to greatness right now.  My film must not suck.  My goal is to screen my film to the film school and not CRINGE.  This is tough because I am sort of hard on myself.  Ahhhh we shall see eh?  I've got a MONTH!
