Feeling dead
As I was watching "The Constant Gardener" (and bawling my eyes out) I realized something that made me cry even more.  I am so scared.  I'm scared of taking risks, I'm scared of pain, I'm scared of sacrifices and of change...anything you can name, I'm scared of it.  I'm probably going to spend the rest of my life being boring and mediocre - I'm never going to save the world or make a difference.  I'm going to work at a stupid job, try and be pleased with tiny achievements in my day, and when I die, the only people who will remember me are whatever friends I manage to have.  I would never be able to die for something I believe in...I'm too selfish and scared.  I'm so scared.  And now I'm making myself even more scared.  What if my life doesn't have meaning?  And how can I make sure it does?  I can't.  I can't even make this pathetic live journal entry sound poetic or anything, which might be a better disguise, or at least an excuse, for my patheticness.  I'm going to go to bed - momentarily shake off this feeling.  This dead, dull feeling.  Hopefully I'll forget about this, hopefully it is just depressing after effects of a depressing movie.  Hopefully.
