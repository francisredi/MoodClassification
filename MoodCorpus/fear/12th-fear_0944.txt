A Toast!
To change, that which brings bigger and better things while sweeping away old burdens.
To the past, filled with moments to cherish and mistakes to be learned from.
To the present, where we gain said moments to cherish and make mistakes, where we guide our future.
To the future, where all of our hopes, dreams, and unfortunately fears, reside.
and lastly,
To alcohol, the grease that keeps the world turning, eases burdens, and numbs pain and fear, if only for a short while in our minds.

What was that about? Well, I'm offf to the Microsft Training Camp tommorow to get both a CompTIA A+ certification and a Network+ certification, and I'm so nervous I could vomit. I'm nearly crying over missing Baby (my doggie) and she's sitting right beside me. I'm a carefully controlled wreck in progress. That's not to say I'm worried about failure, 'cuz if the prereading is any indication I'll have a lot to learn but I'll have no trouble absorbing it. Also, judging from the sample questions my multiple choice logic for guessing things I don't know is still working. It reminds me of high school, how Amara wanted to kill me because I'd never study and consistanly get better test grades than her. In this endeavor I will of course study my ass off. I will leave this place a layman, and I shall return a hardware and networking master. Like a Jedi, but more practical.
