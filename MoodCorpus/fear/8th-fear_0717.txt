Stress stress stress.
The stuff I said two entries ago that I was hoping would get cleared up in 24 hours... I'm thinking it's not going to get cleared up within that time. >_< Tomorrow then... I hope. I pray.

Unfortunately, the anxiety caused by that is going to make me nervy and snappy during rehearsal tonight, probably, and that won't be any fun. Nor will it be fun that rehearsal's going from 9:30 to midnight. I can't help it... today has to be the Ultimate Cleaning Day, but one cast member isn't available till 9:30 and we definitely need at least two and a half hours. At least.

I've also got to do a lot of homework, and I wasted a lot of time up till this evening.

Because I never feel like these kinds of "here's what I did during my day" entries are particularly exciting to anyone but myself, I'll spice it up and ask a provoking set of questions that have been on my mind today.

1. What are people's opinions on modern day feminist issues?
2. Is feminism dead?
3. Has it changed greatly?
4. What are the greatest challenges facing gender equality today?
5. Are men and women similar enough that they should be able to do the same things with equal ability? Or are they different enough that equality should mean something else?
6. Is feminism even an appropriate term?
