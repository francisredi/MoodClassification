I am FREAKING OUT about my interview on friday. I keep running over all the ways it could be bad. Then I worry that my current boss will find out and fire me and then I won't get the other job and I'll have to move home with Dad and Lady Macbeth. Of course, it is kind of nice to already have a job, so even if I crash and burn at the interview I won't be any worse off than I am right now.

I finally picked a car insurance company. I am one step closer to total independence.

My birthday falls on a thursday this year. I have decided that that is crap and have officially moved it to saturday. The girls at work are planning on 'surprising' me with a cake. They can be so sweet.

I have been crazy sick all weekend. Thursday night I kept waking up because my phone was ringing out in the kitchen. When I woke up on friday to see who the hell had been calling me I discovered that my phone had been off. Stupid fever.

K, done now.
