Talk to me when you think I'm not listening to you
I don't really know how to take what happened with Joe.  I guess that I'm apathetic for the most part.  It's not that I didn't care, or that I don't, but there's nothing I can do to make him come back.  I make a lot mistakes.  I'm far from perfect, I can't be what anyone wants.  Everything in my head is a blur.  I feel lonely, but I don't really want to be around anyone either.  I'm just here...waiting, but I don't know what I'm waiting for.  I try not to be belligerent, I try to hide myself, but no matter how hard I try, everything still comes pouring out.  I don't think that there's anything in this life worth being sad about, and I've also concluded that there aren't many reasons to be happy.   Sometimes it all seems like a dream, sometimes it's a nightmare.  I want to walk with my eyes closed, but I always end up opening them up.  I try to hurry, I run so what I see goes away faster, but no matter what, the impact is always the same one.  At times I feel  withered, but there's always that sunshine and water to keep me from dying completely.  I feel a little bit alive, like a fish that has just enough water to survive, but not enough to be comfortable.  I gasp and gasp, but the more air I have, the more I want.  The less I have, the more I wish I hadn't taken what I had for granted.  There will always be questions, sometimes I will find answers, either in my delusion, or when I'm brave enough to face my reality.  The truth is harsh and cold.  Life is...I don't know.  Have I lived enough?  What am I hiding from myself and the world?  The more I dig, the scarier it gets, and the harder it is to come out.  Nothing helps, but...I don't know what.
