Well, college has finally caught up with me...
So I'm sitting is spanish class, frustrated that I'm about to fail another quiz. I was thinking, I've got to work harder, much harder. It's not it used to be, my ability to bullshit and get by with almost no preparation will not save me anymore. I partially blame the university for my lack of drive and preparation abilities. I have never had to truly study at this university, the classes have all seemed easy and the assignments have been a passing of time rather than a studious effort. Anyway, I got my paper back from my spanish teacher and it said to see her after class. She told me that she had trouble reading and understanding my usage. I asked her for some advice and she told me to keep it simple. I was so embarrased. I've never been in that position before. I'm ashamed. Maybe I'm making a bigger deal out of this, but I am on the ropes. I know it. It's almost poetic that all my plans this weekend have fallen through. So, tomorrow after work, I'll get a good nap in, workout, cook a nutritous dinner, and get to work. Both Comm and Span need to be attended to and I should get some good work done sat night. I feel like I'm a law student, spending my sat night working on school stuff. But like I said earlier, the time has come for me to do some legitimate work in college. I'm almost inspired. In a unusual manner, the need to grow has hit me. It's embarrasing having to redo this paper, but since it wasn't my work the first time, I guess I cannot be too upset. I used Babelfish translation, which was a dud to say the least. But I need to get focused. Since my social life is so uneventful these days, I can put more effort into my studies. For what its worth, this semester will be the defining moment of my college curriculum. I need these classes to move on, the rest will be easy. Of course, I wish I had another Coldplay concert to look forward to this weekend. But, I guess work and more work will have to do.
