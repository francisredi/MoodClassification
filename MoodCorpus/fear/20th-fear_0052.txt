But its better if you do
AHH! FUCK SHIT BOLLACK FUCKEN WANK CUNT.

Ive totally just failed my maths exam -_-; i would be optimistic if i said i think i got an E. Fuck it was hard. I mean i just dont care what n+2(squared)-4bc is. NO I REALLY DONT. I need maths to get into college.
Fuck sake. Lifes shit at the moment. 

Oh - Work rang me up today, and go "hey come ride in the show on saturday" ... so im like "OKAY!" and now im shitting it. I feel really worried and scared. Brookfields have such a reputation, a good one that is, most of the horses are always in the top 3, and im going to have to live up to it - Comet (the horse) knows what hes doing, hes been to shows before. Ive never been to a show, ive never competed at a Shire horse show (ive only ever done cross country and showjumping. Helpful on a shire no?) I dunno why but i really feel like ihave to live up to these expectations. Everyone keeps sayign "Youll be fine" or saying "if you dont do well, it dont matter" well it does matter - to me. I mean i know this is ranting a bit, but did i mention that im scared? I feel really intimidated by Elf (the big boss) and Jo (my boss) btu even worse by Dave (Elfs other half) because if i do shit then i know ill never hear the end of it from Dave, and argh. Im SO SCARED! 
AHHHH!
