Prayers please
My father called today to tell me my mother has been admitted to the hospital. There is something wrong with her heart.&nbsp;At this point it looks like she's having angioplasty done tomorrow. Thanks to Air Canada and WestJet I can't get home in time for the procedure. Firstly, I wouldn't be able to get to Montreal until after 9am (too late, it looks like, to get from the airport to downtown before the procedure starts) and secondly, stupid me doesn't have the $800 it costs to fly back on short notice.&nbsp;My father wants me to stay here anyway until we know more, but I'm so scared and I just don't deal well with not being there. If I could even just sit with her I'd feel better. I can't even talk to her because they don't have her in a room. She's in emergency with no phone in her "stall" and she's being transfered to another hospital by ambulance at some point between now and tomorrow morning. The other hospital has a better cardiac care unit.&nbsp;Anyway if you guys can think good thoughts for me and my family right now I would really appreciate it. My mom has never been the sick one. It's always been my dad. He's had lung cancer 3 times and he's 16 years older than her and she's never had any major issues so I'm not only terrified but in complete shock right now.&nbsp;She can't go first. She can't.&nbsp;She's not even retired yet. And my dad is one of those retarded old men who can't do anything on his own. She's probably stressing out right now about him having to cook his own dinner more than she's stressing about his health.&nbsp;I know angioplasty is considered a standard procedure these days and it's probably not a big deal but it's just so shocking that it's happening to her.&nbsp;And standard or not, I'm scared.&nbsp;
