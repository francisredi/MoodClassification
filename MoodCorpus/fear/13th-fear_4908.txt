Home
We're back home.  That's such a strange word.  Home.  

I never made it to the Ebene stronghold.  On the way there, I caught Jake, Lex, and Cecilia, all following me.  That was rather strange.  We spent several days camped out on the open road, mercifully being overlooked by the Ebene patrols and the Phoenix Fighters.  I've developed a special formula to mask my scent so Ariadne can't track me.  Anyway, last night, as we were sitting by the fire, out of nowhere, Shawn came lumbering up the road carrying Eris.  They were both alive and well.  What I don't understand is why the Ebene would have released them.  Something is very wrong with this picture.

Things are horrible back at the House.  Apparently, Kazuo's been forced to marry a Hylian missionary and it's making Adriana very annoying and cranky.  Of course, she deserves to be mad at me, I outright lied at her, but I wish she wouldn't take out this other baggage on me.  It's not my fault she can't get over Kazuo.

I'm afraid.  Afraid of what's going to happen next.  Adriana tersely informed me that the entire House knows what I was up to.  This includes Maze.  I'm afraid of what he'll do to me.  Afraid of what he'll say to my family.  Most of all though, I'm afraid for Shawn.  I don't know what happened to him, what he went through, or if he's entirely...normal.  Worse yet, I have the unavoidable threat of royal retaliation hanging over his head.  

I thought I would be happy.
