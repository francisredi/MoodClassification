Wisdom Teeth
So not much has been going on lately. I go in Friday at 9am to have my wisdom teeth removed. I only have the top two, so both will be taken out. I'm such a big baby about it. For some reason being put under is really freaking me out. I'm even thinking about seeing if they can do it with only local anesthesia. I had a filling done once with/out anything because I was going to work and didn't want my face numb for 1/2 the day. 

They had told me when I went in originally that local was a possibility. However, this place is so busy that the doctor was like, here are your options, now go talk with so-and-so to get pricing. When I got pricing they just talked about intravenous sedation and that was that. I'm sure it will all be fine. This is my first surgery so I'm just being a big wuss. 

Oh and it started hurting again last night. Woke me up in the middle of the night. Today after work I noticed a lump on the inside of my cheek. It's near my wisdom tooth, but not close enough to touch it. It's the size of an eraser on a pencil. So I'm rinsesing with Salt Water again. I think I've done that 3 times since finding it and I'll do that again before I go to bed. Seems like my infection never went all the way away. I keep having pain and restarting the salt-water rinse. 

Since I'm allergic (it seems) to the too common kinds of antibiotic I'm not sure what I'll get after surgery. 

Oh well, wish me luck ;) Pray for my husband, I'm sure I'm going to drive him nuts this weekend.
