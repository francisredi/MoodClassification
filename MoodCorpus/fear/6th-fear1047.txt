Canada's Indecision 2006
I know the polls are just starting to close in Canada, and we've got to wait til that happens aaaall the way west in B.C....but I'm anxious about what's happening in my future home. So in the meantime I'll just post something I posted after Bush got elected the second time around. I value the freedoms we do have in the U.S.; I know it's many more than other countries have...which is why it broke my heart to watch our government develop the way it has, and I suppose has been for many years. I cried like a bitch when I heard this song that day, because was the day I pretty much up gave up on my country, and knew I had to leave.
tis of theethey caught the last poor man on a poor man's vacationthey cuffed him and they confiscated his stuffand they dragged his black ass down to the stationand said "ok the streets are safe now.all your pretty white children can come out to see spot runand they came out of their houses and they looked aroundbut they didn't see no one.
and my country tis of theeto take swings at each other on talk show tvwhy don't you just go ahead and turn off the sun'cause we'll never live long enough toundo everything they've done to youundo everything they've done to you
and above 96th street,they're handing out smallpox blanketsso people don't freezethe old dogs they got a new trickit's called criminalize the symptomswhile you spread the diseasei hold on hard to somethingbetween my teeth when i'm sleepingand i wake up and my jaw achesand the earth is full of earthquakes
and my country tis of theeto take shots at each other on prime time tvwhy don't you just go ahead and turn off the sun'cause we'll never live long enough toundo everything they've done to youundo everything they've done to you
they caught the last poor man flying away in a shiny red capeand they brought him down to the stationand they said "boy you should know betterthan to try and escape"and i ran away with the circus'cause there's still some honest work left for bearded ladiesbut it's not the same goin' town to townsince they put everyone in jail 'ceptthe cleavers and the bradys
and my country tis of theeto take swings at each other on talk show tvwhy don't you just go ahead and turn off the sun'cause we'll never live long enough toundo everything they've done to youundo everything they've done to you

I just hope Bush's northern buddies don't&nbsp;get to do the same thing to Canada that Dubya's been doing to the U.S.
