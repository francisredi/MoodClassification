weird
I don't know what's wrong with me but I feel like I haven't slept for days. I've been doing homework since 6:00 and I stopped at 10:15. I did homework nonstop. I got up once to go to the bathroom and then I ate dinner. Other than that I was doing homework. I have so many things running through my mind ever since I went to the doctor. They just keep coming. And I kinda zone out when I have lots of thoughts. Everything gets blurry, like I'm looking right through everything, and my eyes are focusing for far away..I don't really know how to explain it. I've been doing it quite a bit. I did it a lot in school on friday. It's just like it was before...I'm going down the same path and I don't know how to stop. I don't know how to get away from it. Memories, fears...I'm afraid to fucking go to sleep tonight. We have 2 dogs that never shut the fuck up if someone comes over, and I'm afraid to fucking go to sleep. I'm the only kid here tonight so I'll be alone upstairs in the dark and I'm fucking scared shitless.
