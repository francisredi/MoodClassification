In my defense, Darlington is kinda intimidating...
I went into Darlington with my mum yesterday and I freaked out. It was too loud and full of workmen. It was a little scary to say it was only my second day out in two months or so. That said, I am still determined to go and see X3 tomorrow and to enjoy it. I'm fucking terrified of doing so but I'm feeling determined.

I also went to the doctors about my depression again yesterday. I am now one of the pill popping, therapised elite. Ahem. I got given anti-depressants which handily cover all my major problems (social anxiety, panic attacks and depression). Little freaked out about one of the possible side effects though: "May cause heightened anxiety in panic disorder sufferers for 1-2 weeks." Greeeeeaaaaatttt! He's also organized for me to see a counsellor within the next week and is utterly disgusted with the people who were supposed to get in contact with me. So fingers crossed this time it actually gets done.

So X3 tomorrow... I'm fucking petrified.
