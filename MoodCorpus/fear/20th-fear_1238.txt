Show Friday Night Kane Hodder.
Dierdre and I got ready at my place. Cassy helped. Glad us girls could get some bonding time. Dre made me a shirt with buttons, bows and hello kitty!
We were a little late picking up Steph and Heather but they went to the store. On the way over I did way too many illegal things. They did my makeup whilst I was driving, so I was driving with one eye closed half the time, and then we got behind some guy taking horses and they took the right lane on the roundabout. I got behind a minivan on the roundabout and jumped in the right lane to pass them once we were out. Scary!

Parked at safeway met up with Brandon to go to the tea lady. Kenyan tea is awesome. Walked around to safeway to get candy which we ended up giving to homeless guys. 
At the park in Olympia I got stuck in a tree and had to have Brandon catch me because I was scared. Then I fell out of the tree and hurt myself. Just a little scrape.
Dierdre and I danced and were cheerleaders in the streets. Oh and we got a video of the giraffe dance.
Burning Armada and Kane Hodder were good. Much fun. We accidentally met the new bassist for Kane Hodder his name's Aaron. He said it was only his second show but he did well.
Some guy was wearing a motley crue shirt,...but I won't even say how badly I made a fool of myself. Ugh.
OH OH OH AND I SAW DIZZLE!!!!!!!!!!


After the show dried blood was discovered on my arm not on the same part but the same arm as my scrape. I washed it off so I hope I don't get AIDS :( I was so nervous I made Dre drive home because I'm such a hypochondriac.
