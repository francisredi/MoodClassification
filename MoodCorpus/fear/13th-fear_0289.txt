my cat is fat, and he makes me happy
Not a whole lot to report. I put 900 miles on my car between Thursday and Sunday. I drove all the way up to Princeton, New Jersey to stay with Ashly for my very last audition. I enjoyed our time in NYC. It was fantastic to catch up with Ashly and meet her new love interest. My audition wasnt really that great, however I went into the audition room with a piss-poor attitude. After 4 auditions and practicing the same audition rep for 6 months, I was pretty much over the whole process. Not to mention that I had to do my audition on a mini-stage in a completely dead room with a sinking stand...survey says: X (EHHHH)

I talked to a rep from Busch today confirming my hire in Festhaus. I'm a little nervous about finishing up this year and working at Busch...but not nearly as nervous as I am to tell my principal/assistant/students that I'm not coming back next year. I feel like such a dick for "abandoning" all of these people. I just hoping they will realize that I do not fit in this town, and I need to get out while I still have the chance. 

I also had the privilege of attending Carly B's wedding on Saturday. Even after attending 7 weddings since last June I still get a little ferklempt. It was a very sweet wedding. KT and I had a blast, especially on her dad's tab at the bar...holla

3 months and 4 days til graduation
