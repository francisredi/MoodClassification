>_<
I am horribly nervous right now. &gt;_&lt; I don't know what to do. I tried researching a little bit about the course, Mass Comm, but I just can't concentrate. It's my first time being to an interview anyway, so maybe that's why I'm nervous like hell! &gt;_&lt;The interview will be on 8.30 am and now it's 6am.. so there are more than 2 hours left for me to get ready. There will be some sort of an entrance exam at the same time, so that's what I'm nervous about. I don't know if it's really an entrance exam, my brother said it was, because on the website, it stated that it's an exam. -_-; But that doesn't matter, what matters most is that it's an exam. An exam. I know, I'm not making sense anymore. I just hope everything will go well though. I hope I wouldn't make a fool of myself. Heck, I don't even know what to wear! &gt;_&lt;And my cat's not doing anything to help either. Just moments ago, he tore a page from my newly bought dictionary. ;_; I need the dictionary for the interview. It's a dual language dictionary. I really don't know why I would need it, I guess it's for the exam. -_-; I dunno. The website said to bring it along.My parents aren't up yet. They'll be sending me to the university, because yesterday we went to take a look around the place, it's beautiful but very very very far away from my house. Anyway, I haven't visited Nagayan's blog in a long while, and I saw this pic of him with Tuti, so cute~! &gt;_&lt;
