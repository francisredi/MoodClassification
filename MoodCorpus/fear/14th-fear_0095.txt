OMG!!! I ALMOST DIED!!
So I really wanted some chocolate when I got home, so I was like hey I'll make cookies.  Well we didn't have any chocolate chips, so I thought oatmeal raisin, didn't have any oat meal so I called my mommy and she was like I have a really good recipe for "cow patty" cookies, it's in one of my stacks of recipes.  So I go and look for it and I can't find it.  I finally find it and my mommy comes home and helps me.  So anyway I'm using the hand blender adding the butter, sugar, and vanilla not doing anything to provoke anything and all of a sudden I hear and see sparks and this pain shoots up my arm.  I jump back seconds from shitting myself and the cord on the thing is fried and the circuit is blown and my arm hurts like hell.  My mom was scared and I almost cried I was so scared.  So I stepped back and back and back, after the initial shock subsided I thought oh shit do I have all of my fingers and hair, so I start counting 10 fingers and no singged hairs, but god damn my arm hurts.  I'm never gonna use that thing again.  My arm still hurts, I made my mommy finish the cookies cause I was scared shit less.  The cookies are good though.

Anyway don't want another one of those to happen.  I'm still shaking.  

Moral of the story don't make cookies, have someone else make them for you.
