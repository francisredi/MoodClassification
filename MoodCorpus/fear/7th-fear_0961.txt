No more Ghost Stories, Jen...
As I was talking to my mother tonight, I looked over at my fridge in the kitchen, which is right across from my couch where I am currently sitting, and on it, this paper was like moving. Slowly, at first and then faser and then slow again, and then it stopped, and then it started again. Oh My GOD! I was freaking out. I had just finished watching 3 hours of scary stories, and the last one had really really freaked me out, with a door closing when no one was there, and this guy got so scared he screamed like a girl. I was freaked out. I gave myself hives, seriously. Like, as I was watching it, and like screaming into the phone that my house is haunted, my feet starting hurting like none other. Oh it was so embarassing. I moved the magnet on the paper, and it hasn't moved yet, but I still have the hives, and I look over at the paper like every four and a half seconds, because seriously, I think it was a ghost. I mean I don't really believe in them, but they scare me to death... And I remember this comic that Grace and I watched where she was saying that ghosts finally get the power to communicate with the living, and they decide to move a teacup, or some paper. Right, if I was a ghost, and I could affect stuff for the living, I would totally fuck around with people... No I would not go to Montana and help someone "accidentally" fall down some steps, or go crazy and get put into a padded room, I don't know where you got that idea...

Seriously though, I was terrified. I almost peed my pants, and I was like yelling into the phone. Yes, I am that cool, a piece of paper moves in my house, and I almost push the panic buttom so I don't have to be alone... yep. I 'm that cool...
