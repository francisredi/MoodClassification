dreams. and more dreams.
Lately I've been feeling isolated from the rest of the world. My dreams keep getting weirder or scarier. Last night I had a dream that I was at someone's house and I was walking towards the bathroom. But since all the rooms in this house are connected to one another, I figured I would go through another bedroom than walk into the hallway. Big mistake. I walked into a dark secret hallway and right ahead I saw a brightly lit room that was all dusty and old looking. In the dark hallway I saw my friend Alexis, dead, in the fetal position. On the bed there were 2 other Alexis's, dead as well, in the fetal position. She was wearing boxers and a wifebeater. Her blonde hair pulled back into a bun. The worst part is that her eyes were open, staring into the empty air. Then I guess I realized how scared I really was and ran back in the other bedroom and into the hallway. Then I woke up. It seemed so real, and I'm getting chills just thinking about it. I can't seem to shake it off because it's just so weird. I usually forget my dreams, but this one seems to be sticking with me.
