you heard him going "baby I love you & I'll leave her & I'm coming out to California"
Okay, I'm not going to try to be brave much on this one. 

My PCOS appointment is on Wednesday, and even though I'm relieved I'm finally going to get myself looked at, I'm terrified they're going to find something or some reason to cut me open. Or that they won't give me anymore pain meds since I'll have "no reason" after I get looked at. Or that they'll put me on more trial hormone treatments for three month periods saying "oh, just get used to it". 

You know, basically, the same old shit since last year.

I'm afraid that my option to have kids (or not) will be taken away from me.

I'm afraid I'll get diabetes, since it's pretty easy to with PCOS (though if you're obese, it's far far more likely).

I'm afraid that I'll be in chronic pain the rest of my life, complete with side-effects (nausea, insomnia, panic attacks even on the psych meds).

I'm afraid that I'll be physically limited because of all of this, that I won't be able to do things at the same pace like I did before.

It's normal to have these fears. And this isn't something that will kill me. But at the same time, I'm still scared.
