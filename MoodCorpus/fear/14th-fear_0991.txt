a little worried...
Me and sarah werent so good today, we got a little annoyed at the same time and then she acted a little weird for the rest of the day pretty much. But kaitlyn left me a comment on my last entry telling me something I didnt expect. That sarah was "all over" ashley's boyfriend. So after some long conversations and me explaining that id break up with sarah in a heartbeat if she did something stupid (no matter how much I care about her) I pretty much found out that not too much happened, but she does flirt a little with other people and I told her it better stop. Basically, she flirted with ashley's bf a little and the only really bad thing that happened was he "poked her in the leg" and then she poked him back and "accidentally" (idk, thats what she says and I trust her, but im going to pretend thats the truth) poked him in the dick. (he then proceeded to get a boner) - and I guess they joked about that or summat IDK, and I definately dont want to think about it.

but god ive never been so serious...idk ive lost a bit of trust in sarah tonite... and idk whats gonna happen with us, im kinda scared cuz I dont want to lose her, I really hope she doesnt do something stupid.

she is coming over tomorrow, and idk, we were on the phone a little while ago and when we got off the phone noone said I love you (usually she says it first when we get off the phone). Idk what to think about that, wouldnt she make it clear that she does love me alot and doesnt want to screw us up? idk what was going through her head, but im keeping myself on guard for anything bad to happen for the next week. 

She might be confused about us, but I really hope thats not the case.
I dont want this to be a failed relationship....

I hope everything is ok tomorrow.
im worried....
