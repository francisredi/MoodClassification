GAH.
So I was watching Imp swim about in his tank, and suddenly, from underneath his tank, crawled this GIGANTIC bug which then fell pitifully to the ground because it wasn't a very well bug, but I still freaked out. My reaction to this bug was exactly like any normal person's reaction to having a gun pointed at them would be. So it ricocheted off of my Otogi furby and landed on the carpet. I was on my feet in an instant, and was searching frantically around for something hard to smush it with. I grabbed the first hardback book I saw, "The Nature of Good and Evil," which makes me snicker now. Anyway, so then I was too scared to get near it to actually kill it, so I called for my mom to come upstairs to do it for me. It turned out to be... a lightning bug x_x;;; I have no idea how it got in my room. 

asdfgh. I wish I didn't have this phobia, because it causes me much stress x_x Well, at least I know my gland that produces adrenaline works. Gotta look on the bright side.
