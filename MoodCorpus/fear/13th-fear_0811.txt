I am a little frustrated with myself right now. I was on Western's website and realized that when I return next semester I will still be a sophomore and I have only earned 42 credit hours out of 72 attempted hours. I'm really afraid that I will get back up there and not be able to hack it. My mom is always saying that some people are not meant for college. What if I am one of those people and I just haven't realized it yet? I don't want to get back up there and do the same old shit that I use to do. The stuff that kept me from making good grades. It's easy to say that all of my focus is going to be on school and I'm not going to goof around, it's another thing to actually do it. 
   I have always quit at stuff when it got to hard. I quit at my jobs, my relationships, dance, girl scouts, gymnastics, and then school. I don't want to quit anymore. I don't want to be afraid of trying new things. I'm tired of letting fear control my life. Sometimes I guess we just have to take a chance and step out into the unknown. And sometimes we have to take these chances alone. My destiny is in my hands. Now, all I have to do is go out and get it.
