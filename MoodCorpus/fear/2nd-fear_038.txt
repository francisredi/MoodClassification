We seriously need to stop this
Last night I had a really creepy dream...one of my professors wanted me, and he was going to do anything in his power to get me. He started to stalk me, conveniently being everywhere that I was. I tried to tell him that I didn't want this, then I tried to lie and tell him that I had a boyfriend and I desperately tried to get someone to pretend to be my boyfriend, but he wouldn't and I was afraid that he'd get shot beacuse this dude was totally after me. I even tried to distract him with Madison and Alex, hoping that he'd want one of them instead, but to no avail.

One time I was in an elevator, and he got on it, so I pushed the emergency stop button, jumped out, and ran as fast as I fucking could. There was a big grassy lawn outside and I had to avoid all these people playing sports and stuff. Eventually Alex and Julie pinned me to the ground and out he comes, all...pimpified. I was so scared that I was going to die or something, and then...

And then...

I woke up.
