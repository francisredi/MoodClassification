I just thought about it, summer's just around the corner. What's going to happen to me?

- submit requirements for talent test in UP (Fine Arts)
- submit my appeal for Ateneo
- enroll for summer workshop in UP (either drawing or photography. wish i could take both)
- work on my artistic skills and create art!
- work on my music/jam! hoy mga kabanda ko. :D
- graduation ball (MC & Ateneo!)
- practice driving
- get lisence
- hang out with friends, of course :D
- take the talent test (with a fair few whom i know are taking it too. :D)
- pray
- save money (i'm thinking about getting a new guitar...)

so yeah, there. stuff to do, stuff to do.

please please please pray for me that i pass the talent test. there's a hell lot of other people out there way more talented than i am. i just hope i can match them...or do better. i'm hella scared and at the same time excited. but more of scared.
