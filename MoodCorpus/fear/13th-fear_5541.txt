Other life updates:1. I am no longer suffering from throat viral infections (sexy right?)2. I bought a new $300 digital camera (Canon 450)&nbsp;shhhhhhhhhhhdon't tellIt actually came out to $416.27 *cringes*did I mention I'm bad with impulsive buying?3. I had a not-so-pleasant reality check that kindof scared me - seeing as I'm going to graduate in a year and I (for the 1st time in my life) have jack-shit of a clue as to what I am going to do with my life and how I am going to support myself. So I looked at my transcript and grades (bad idea) then I looked at my chances for getting into a PA school (even worse idea) and now I am TERRIFIED and depressed about the future. Mainly cause I realize I don't really have one.&nbsp;So I have officially hit the panic button and am frantically trying to pick up the pieces of my once-inexhaustable ambition.
