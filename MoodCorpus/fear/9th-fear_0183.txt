The problem with having an injury you can't disguise at work (I'm not in pain, generally, unless I twist my ankle in any way, but it's still uncomfortable, and I can't walk without limping) is that, should your shop be overstaffed, you're on top of the list to be granted a very generous day off to heal. It has its advantages, and I'm trying not to take it personally, because it is a reasonable choice, and another day of not walking around can only be good for my ankle's healing, but I'm pretty anxious about still being welcome back in two days. My understanding is this place has no particular qualms about saying, "Hey, we don't need you anymore after, oh, now," and if I'm already not present, that seems like all the less job assurance.

It does mean I can stay up a little later tonight, though, which is a bonus. And maybe I'll feel well enough tomorrow to clean, or at least wash the dishes (which requires essentially no walking around).

Stupid gimpy foot.

/me cuts it off.
