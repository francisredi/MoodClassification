Get ahold of yourself, don't worry about the aftermath.
Bad luck seems to be surrounding me the past couple days.  I left my wallet at a Taco Bell... After noticing that my purse was a lot lighter, I retraced my steps and they were holding it for me, thank God.  Last night at around 1:00am the power went out with a loud explosion.  I am terrified of the dark, and monsters in the closet, or living room, or kitchen, or anywhere they could be hiding, so I didn't want to move.  We lit some candles and Tony and I slept next to the fireplace, with a baseball bat.  This morning, after a good couple-hours sleep, but a good one, I got up to get ready for work.  As I was leaving, I drove over the gardener's $500 tool.  Destroyed it.  Had no idea.  I got an angry message from mom after work about it.  She had to buy him a new one and now I owe her my life.  I have an unmanageable amount of homework to do before 8:00am tomorrow morning.  Fortunately, tomorrow is payday.
On a side note:  I have a secret that I'm not ready to tell.  It makes me frightened, and nostalgic, and incredibly nervous.  But like I said, I'm not ready.  I still have a lot of work to do.
