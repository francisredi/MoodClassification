Eep!
So yesterday was the winter choir concert, it was okay except i messed up on my solo...meh...anyway tonight was the winter band concert and that was okay. I went and looked at prom dresses today with Alex which was fun, I have a dress I really really want but I probably wont get it :'( Tomorrow is Lionel Hampton and the Motion City Soundtrack concert :DDD My&nbsp; mom came home sick tonight so I am scared I will get what she got, and plus my stomachs been hurting already most this afternoon :S so scared of getting sick...probably has something to do with the deep seeded route of when my brother got really sick when i was younger, so ya...im really scared of being sick...So I think I am going to go to bed so that I can just sleep and not think about being sick. So nervous for tomorrow!!!"Oh...seems like I'm always on my own,Seems like I'm never coming homeSeems like I'm always on my own...All the stars and boulevards ain't close enough for you...One last phone call from you, it wouldn't hurt much,Just like to hear your voice and pretend to touch,Any inch of you that hasn't said it all or read it all or sungMy life away"
