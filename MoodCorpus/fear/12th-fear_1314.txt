What a way to start off the day
I went to sleep early last night (well early for me) and before I fell asleep I had this feeling that something wasnt right.

Well My father had to go to the Hospital this morning because he was having Chest pains. At first they were going to drive, but my father must have been in enough pain because he told my mother call 911. The paramedics came pretty quickly and did the EKG stuff and it doesnt look like he was having a heart attack. They think it might have been Angina but right now he's in the hospital getting checked out. 

I'm gonna go down later. I really really really hate Hospitals. Never liked going to them. Last year I couldnt bring myself to go see my father when he was in the hospital after his back surgery and he had that nasty staph infection. That almost killed him last year and since then its just been one thing after another. I swear he was alot healthier when he was smoking half a pack of Marlbro a day.

I just hope this isnt one of those precursors because he was having some other problems. Then again maybe all that stuff brought this on so who knows.

I was starting to write my column last night but thats obviously on hold right now. 

Other then that I think everything is fine. But I'll find out later for sure.
