Why my body will be the end of me, part 234389734527...
So I peed blood this morning.  Which given my kidney history, scared the living fuck out of me.  I was hoping for a UTI (isn't that sad, "hoping for a UTI"), and fearing that my remaining properly functioning kidney was kicking off.  I went to the doctor, who diagnosed it as kidney stones.  Yeah, kidney stones, as if there wasn't enough wrong with me.  She sent me to the hospital to set up an appointment to get the "little" kidney diagnostic procedure done.  And by "little" I mean for most people it's a pretty normal thing, but since my kidneys are already beaten down it could cause them to conk out altogether (if any of you are type O+, now is the time to step up).  But if I don't get it done they won't know how to treat it, and that would only potentially lead to larger problems.  I'm leaving school Wednesday afternoon for the pre-procedre BS, and getting the thing done Thursday morning.  The proceedure will determine if they're stones I can pass or if I have to have surgery to have them removed.

I'm really scared over all this.  I don't think I'm going to die or anything like that, I'm just scared it's going to hurt really bad.  I've heard hell stories about kidney stones being worse than childbirth and I'm not looking forward to it.  Right now they're only a little swollen and sore but my doctor said to pretty much expect to be in pain.  :/


so um...wish me luck I guess?  I just want to be better by next weekend.
