Can You Even Imagine....
how horrid it is to have your own novel sitting in Word on the computer right before you--and be AFRAID to open it? Too afraid to even LOOK at it, for fear you will discover it actually MIGHT BE any of the hundreds of bad things you have imagined it to be in the last two months since you last saw it?

Any of the thousands of bad things all the agent blogs SAY we should expect our work to be. Tired, overdone, mediocre, boring... things too frightening to contemplate. So much advice on how bad we are and so little on how to tell the difference. Read the latest best sellers. (ummm mostly....YUCK) compare your work to top sellers in your genre (like if we could be that objective we would NEED to ask for their advice...I know a lot of writers and darn few if ANY are able to honestly "see" their own work) Read boring trade papers to see what is selling. Fine. I read them to see WHO is agenting and/or publishing what. But since any decent writer knows you can NOT write "to the trends" how does THIS help us evaluate our current work?

I know. I know. I am jaded and sarcastic and irrevocably whiny. 

I need to write.

Now if only I could hit "enter" and bear to look at what I have written....
