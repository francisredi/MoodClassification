For homework for church class, I have to go interview a class member and be interviewed by them.   And I don't want to. It's terrifying to me. Like, not only do I have to deal with my own past, with the abuse I've experienced around my religious beliefs, with the memories of that that the class brings up, with the stark and hopeful contrast between those memories and the very positive things that we learn in class, with people's discomfort with the fact that I'm taking a class at a church at all... but I have to be brave and overcome my fear and be willing to risk getting to know someone in the class? 

I'm scared to do that. I feel like getting close to people in a church group has led to my abuse before. And also, I don't want to talk about that to these people because that's the exact kind of thing that I'm afraid of! I feel like it's unfair that I have to deal with this shit at all, frankly. I assume that nobody else there has these issues, which is not particularly fair or relevant of me, and that I'm the only one for whom a single class where we just sit and talk about things and eat is so hard. Plus, my partner in this exercise has called at least four times to change where we're doing it. I THINK we're now doing it outside near the fountain near the lake, which is not very specific. I think I can find it though. 

I notice myself planning not to look up where things are or not to bring my cell phone, as a way of sabotaging it. I don't want to do that, though. I want to TRY having this be safe. I like the person I'm partnered with in this exercise, despite the whole changing-places thing. It won't, probably, hurt me to talk to him. It just makes me feel sick to my stomach. It's so easy to think that I should just go on with my buried fears and experiences instead of digging them up and working through them. But I resolved not to do that anymore....
