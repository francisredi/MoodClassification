Edvard Munch

Edvard Munch should paint your portrait.  You are a very emotional person.  You are always up for a good talk with one of your friends.  You don't like to keep things bottled up.  Often, you are friendly and outgoing, but that can change very easily to being introverted and cold.

The above description is possibly the best description I have ever recieved from one of these corny journal quizzes.

Anyways, I must say, I'm pretty mentally exhausted. Because of the changes in my life (and probably hormones too) I'm back to one of my oldest, hardest-to-break, and worst habits- obcessively fretting over hypothetical and imaginary situations. After the initial thoughts are repeatedly had, it begins to snowball, where I begin to beat myself up for having worried about the initial thoughts, making it a quite rediculous, and devastatingly pointless experience. It is difficult to talk about these things, because they are so nonsensical and obcessive that I fear sounding a little less than sane.

I know and understand what is happening and why, yet somehow this doesn't make it any easier to calm my mind nor diminish the problem. Some moments I feel strong, and see very clearly through the self-inflicted storm, but it only lasts until the next wave of paranoia washes over my refreshing progress.

These are the times that I especially miss my old best friend- Pat. If anyone in this world ever fully understood this curse, it was him. But our lives have changed so drastically, and sadly, we may not even know each other very well anymore.
