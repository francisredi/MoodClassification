I have no clue how I'm going to get everything done for Tuesday and Wednesday. I mean, I'm still working on my Yakuza paper and because of work I haven't been able to get to all of my sources - I have tomorrow, but what about my Egan essay due on Wednesday? And I have to work tomorrow night, too, because my dumbass manager scheduled me in on the day of my exam this week and the only way I could switch and NOT lose my hours was if I switched with someone so I'd be working on Monday. 

I think some more all-nighters are in my future. Yep. I think I'll be staying up all night tonight, probably all night after I get home on Monday from work, and then I'll be (hopefully) handing in my essay later in the day on Tuesday, and then I'm supposed to work on my Egan essay due Wednesday and somehow study for my Wednesday exam. Holy shit.  This is not happening.

I already wrote Egan and said that, unfortunately, my essay may just end up getting handed in late. I don't know what else I can do. I can only hope that after all of this hell I will still be graduating with honors. Because I can't imagine the nightmare if I don't. If i screw everything up in my last year.

This seems utterly insurmountable at the moment. I can only hope that some inner strength formerly unknown to me will suddenly emerge and I will pull it out of my ass.

God, I'm scared shitless.

I gotta go and stare at my blank laptop screen some more.
