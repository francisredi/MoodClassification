Horror continued...
There she was waiting for us in her easy chair...she had apparently lied to the police, and there will be a warrant out for my dad's and my arrest in three different states by June 5th. How? The world may never know. She's talked herself out of fraud, money and item theft, signing and cashing checks that weren't hers...now she's trying to put away the only people who ever cared for her and/or helped her out. Just doesn't make sense. I go to court on June 5th...wish me luck. Hopefully she'll be put where she belongs and justice will prevail. Unfortunately I fear that my dad may be treated unjustly just because he's a male and she's a master mind manipulator...if you pray, please pray for us. 

On a side note...I've completely moved into my new dorm. I'll be moving into another one in July so she won't be able to track me hopefully. I started my job at UNM this week, and I start my dance class the day I go to court. I HATE drama with a passion. Once she is dealt with, I should never have to deal with drama again in my life...I live in a horror movie, a dream from which I cannot wake.
