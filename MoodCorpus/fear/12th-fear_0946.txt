I was having beignets with Craig, my mother, and Craig's father and suddenly the topic changed to the next hurricane season.
Has it really been almost a year? It's still so fresh in my mind. There isn't a day that goes by that I don't think about Katrina and what happened. It's not always sad, but it's always there.
It's weird that in some places, like Oregon or something, Katrina wasn't a big deal. It's just so weird it didn't really affect everyone, just me. Just New Orleans. Just the Gulf.

And it's really scary that another hurricane season is coming up. I don't think I could take evacuating again. What if another one hits? I was really lucky during Katrina, I didn't loose anything I couldn't replace. I didn't loose my house or a family member.
Although I had some rough patches (serious ones) with Craig, we're back together and stronger than ever. We care about each other and give to one another. We make each other happy. What if another hurricane hits and we have to start over?
What if this time I am not so lucky?
What the hell am I going to do then?
