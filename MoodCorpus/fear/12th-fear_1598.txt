So my doctor thinks i'm having migraines and prescribes a migraine medication for me. Last night was my first dose and well let's just say i'm not sure if i'm going to be taking it ever again. I woke up an hour after I had taken the medicine freaking out because I had a nightmare that I can only remember bits and pieces of and from what I remember, I don't remember why I was that afraid. But, when I woke up, the room was moving and blurry and I felt paranoid. Then, I looked in the mirror and the pupil in my right eye was smaller than the one in my left. I was totally freaking out but I was too outta it and tired to call the doctor or go to the ER so I just went back to sleep and fortunately, I felt better by morning. I'm supposed to take one tonight, but I don't think that'll be happening. I have to go back to that doctor on Thursday anyways for an MRI to rule out brain tumors and stuff like that so I'll tell him what happened when I go back. That is if I don't get shot first. The doctors is on the Northside of Youngstown and it had a bullet hole in the front door-- no joke! The nurse said everytime they fix it, it just keeps happening again and someone was actually robbed coming out of that drs a few weeks ago. So, If I'm not murdered on Thursday I will update you on what the doctor said about my "episode" last night lol. 

Time to go to Rich's house!! =)
