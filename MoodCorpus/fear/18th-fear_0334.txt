Oh, man, what am I doing?
Well, tommorow is the day I leave for Arlington to visit Six Flags, and the Grapevine Mall in Dallas. My teacher gave each student in the Horticulture class (including myself, duh) $200 dollars for us to spend on the trip. The other classes don't get to receive the money, because, well, they weren't the ones who potted over 3,000 (yes, literally) pots, watered them, trimmed, and all of that other good stuff. Not to mention that we had to stay all day long at the Spring Sale, and topped over thousands of dollars worth of profits (the teachers never told us how much we truly made), which was hard labor, carrying those stupid plants back and forth between long distances and running around non-stop all day, egh. 

Anyway, this is not really the reason why I'm updating, I'm simply nervous because this has been the first school trip I've ever taken in years, since elementary I believe. I've purposely skipped the past ones I've had chances to take, but, being that this is a small class that I know relatively well enough, then I feel a bit more comfortable going. It still doesn't change the fact that I'm nervous, I feel like something bad may happen to me; its happened many a time before and past field trips, why should this one be any different?

I don't know...it has been years

So I'm going for it. Everybody is older and much more mature (except for one student, ugh, I hate her so much, and I think I might have to put up with the bitch in a room ::sighs:: not that we talk or fight or anything like that, I just hate her rude ass XDD).

I won't be back 'till Sunday.

Wish me luck...
