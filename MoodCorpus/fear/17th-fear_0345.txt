fear consumes me
i'm scared. i admit it.
scared of so many things.

but i know i have to face up to them, whether i like it or not. i can't hide all my life. i would hate myself if i did. so i am going to throw myself out there in the wild and see how life decides to treat me.

i'm not ready. but i have to be.

it may seem like such a tiny deal. but for someone who has lost herself in these few months, it's not easy to get back up again. i know there are people out there who suffer a greater deal than what i'm going through. i'm not shaking a fist at god and complaining why i can't have a better life. i'm just voicing out my fears. so don't tell me anything about people suffering more than i do, and that this tiny challenge in my life is nothing.

because it's SOMETHING to me. period.

it is so like him to give me that final push, and then disappear. 

i wish time would stand still. the days are nearing.
