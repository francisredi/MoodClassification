Today, today, today!
Today is a day of mixed ambitions. One half of me believes with all my heart that today is going to be a great day. After all, I get to stay at Steve's place tonight and (finally) see him. *long content sigh*

However, an equal part of me is dreading to leave this house. My anxiety is high. Scenarios of disaster are running through my head and I can't stop them. A car crash. Sickness. Failure.

I know what this is stemming from---my dwindling bank account and my lack of employment. I tell myself that everything is just fine and a job is on its way, but my mother's voice shrieks through my mind and it hurts, and I feel the need to do something. I jump out of bed in the morning for no reason. I sleep for 3 hours and wake up raring to go even though my body is still begging for 5 more hours of sleep. I leap from times of extreme happiness (Steve) to times of extreme dissapointment and depression (Me). 

My heartbeat is irregular and it hurts. I don't like looking at myself. I feel like a dissapointment to everyone.

It will pass. It always does. It's the part where I have to sit still and ride it out that really kills me.
