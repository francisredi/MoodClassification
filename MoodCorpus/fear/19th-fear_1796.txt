"now i'm doing it, with ted nugent"
I got court tomorrow. I'm super nervous. I got all kinds of things to do around this house. Its insane. I need to clean my room a little, tidy up and put the dishes up. I got to do laundry and finish packing. Its not a lot, but its a daily task thats done through out the day , not within a few hours before I get to sleep.Damn procrastination. I think the cloths just got done washing. Theres bugs outside and I don't want to put the cloths in the dryer, but I need them for the trip.I was tellin my sister about Ole Dude, about how he was "snappin" and I thought that shit was hot.Then I was reading the letter Brandon Coughlin wrote me and she said "Which Brandon, Black Brandon?" and I was like " No, not Black...shhhhhhhhhhhh my daddy." &nbsp;lol. Why is that funny , idk. I think when I have a severe amount of pressure I find more than everything amusing. I need to talk to my sister. lol.We be laughin at everything.My jaw is hurtin so bad. I chew gum too much.&nbsp;My daddy told me today "shut the FUCK up"It hurt my feelings and I didn't talk to him. Then finally when my voice felt stable I told him no one talks to me that way. No one. Then idk. Just whatever.Okay... &lt;3Peace
