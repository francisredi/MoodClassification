OH GOD!!!
Major crises... talked about this to rockchick today at the cinema and decided to go for it. E-mailed him at about 10.30 pm and OH MY GOD, he replied already. I cannot look at it. There are two replies, so I don't know if it is actually a reply or whether the e-mails didn't get through and these are two "couldn't deliver" messages... but then it would say that in the subject line, right? And it would be from a mailer-demon or something and not have his name on it??? Oh god, I need to die. Right now!!! Why did I do that. I knew it was a bad idea the minute I hit "send". I feel so ill, I feel nauseous and I'm shaking and I just want to run away and scream.... God, why, why, why did I do this? How STUPID can you be? Even if all these e-mails say is "no prob, will do asap", I will still have suffered a nervous breakdown by the time I finally open them. Oh God I cannot open them. I need to get somebody else to do it... cat??? You get double the chocolate!!! Dear lord, there goes all hope of sleep for tonight. I knew this day was going to end badly. I knew it after waking up this morning with bloody fingernailmarks on the inside of my hands from clasping a fist so tightly my nails drew blood... I need to die. Forget essays, assignments or even the future, I need to jump off St Rule's tower tomorrow. Right now I think I need to take motion sickness chewing gum... God, whywhywhy??? Just make it go away...
