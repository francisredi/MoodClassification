confusion
i really should stop talking so much when i'm nervous. its like i just ramble and ramble and ramble on and on and on about nothing at all and it really makes me look like an idiot but why do i keep doing it?! esp when i'm nervous i mean its not like people can't tell i'm nervous. and why was it so hard to ask him? why was it so hard to talk to him about it?? i've never really had trouble before but why was it so hard to talk to him about it? my words were like a big mush pile of random thoughts and words and nothingness. i'm usually so good about choosing my words wisely and getting exactly wut i mean out but i just couldnt. i really couldnt. i was practically stalling the entire time. close the window. open the window. open the door. close the door. (sigh) i'm a lost cause...its all a lost cause. why am i fussing over this? i'm so flustered. eric was right. i am a flustered person. i can't believe i took jacie's advice and wrote it down!! i can't believe i sat there reading off a paper!!! wut a fool am i. its not like it matters that much to me. does it? no it doesnt. now all questions are answered and there is no longer an issue. period.

i have to be patient now, right? right. besides i have my own issues to deal with i should deal with those first. yeah. but for now, i wait. have faith. play the game that i've NEVER lost.
