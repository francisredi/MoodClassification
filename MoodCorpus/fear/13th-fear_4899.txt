I have an interview at Davis.  It's pretty much an exercise in ranking the waiting list, but I have an interview.  Mid April- they gave me four dates to choose three and they'll send me the one I'm supposed to go on.  Am I excited?  A little.  Am I nervous?  HELL YES.  

I think the thing to keep in mind is that this is just an experience- on that I can go into and take something away from for next year.  Try and take some of the pressure off myself because those of you who know me, know how I get before big events I've planned. 

Well, this one has been in the works for 19 years.  

In other news- I've been strangely exhausted as of late- no matter how much I sleep, I can't seem to feel really awake.  I really miss when I was a kid and I used to wake up and have all this energy.  Yuck yuck yuck.  I think it's time to start taking up with the iron pills again.  The rain is supposed to cut out April 8th, so hopefully I can start taking walks again without omgsuddenflood.
