I want that car.
GAH! I've been watching Supernatural all day, that WB show with Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki. Not only have I developed this hero-worship deal with Jensen Ackles' character, Dean Winchester, but I am seriously freaking myself out since it is now almost midnight and all of the lights are off in the house, and I'm just sitting here alone in my living room watching it. Talk about Creepy. I'm on the Bloody Mary episode... Jeeze. I remember when I was much younger and I would stay at my cousin Maria's house and her older brothers would scare us and try to get us to say Bloody Mary in the mirrors and use the Quija board... (Which, after watching a hypnotist's show at 3 AM on Friday morning, I think I know how the Quija board really works, but that's a completely different story.)

Anyways, my mom found an ad in the paper advertising jobs at this shoe factory, so tomorrow I will be off to check that out (hopefully, if I can get my arse in gear), and then I also need to get back with someone from this other factory about a job there. So, at least I have two options, and both are factory jobs. If all else fails, I'll probably end up as some type of guide at the local tourist spot, you know? But, the whole factory thing appeals to me. I would know exactly what to do every day, and I could go in and do it. 

And anyways, went to a fucking awesome concert on Friday night--the 7 Shot Screamers. Damn, even though I've seen other really amazing bands, I have never had more fun anywhere else.

In-fucking-credible.

And, anyways, all I'm doing now is procrastinating because Supernatural is seriously freaking me out and I'm only nine minutes and fifty-five seconds into the episode. 

But have I ever mentioned that I love being terrified?
