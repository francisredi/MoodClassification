Hoping to Accept
There are things that I'm constantly scared of and do not trust.  I sometimes wish that I wasn't able to think so deeply.  It's what makes me hurt, and makes me cut, and even though I know that it's all wrong, I still do it.  It hurts so many people when I cut, and especially the one closest to my heart.  Why do I continue to do it then?  This is the question I ask myself everytime the thought comes in my head.  

I always have a suspision of certain things, and that's what gets me upset.  When I don't know something.  I get so jealous.  It's something that I can't help.  It's a problem.  I'm selfish and wish to have him all to my own, and when I get nervous about the pictures, it gets me upset.  Especially when I don't know if they've been looked at recently or not.  I can't help but envy them, even though all of them are practically computer done.  

I wish that this jealousy and hatred would stop.  It scares me, it really does.  I need to have the will power to overcome what ever it is that's bothering me, and just learn to accept.  It's going to be difficult for me to accept some things with the way that my personality is and the way that my mind works...especially when I'm home alone....
