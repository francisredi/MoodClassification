I'm So Anxious
I can't believe I am only a little over a month away from having what i've always dreamed of having, BOOBS!!!! I'm getting so anxious nowadays. I must read at least 3 hours of breast augmentation info a day. I spend a great deal of my time on the www.makemeheal.com website where the ladies on these are extremely helpful. I am so thankful that I've been given this opportunity to have the surgery. Conrad has saved all of this money up for me so that I can have what I've always wanted. Is he not the greatest boyfriend? He could be spending that money on so many other things, yet, he saves it all for me. We actually spend that money next Tuesday at my Pre-Op appointment with Dr. Pousti.

I am so gonna take pictures holding all that money in my hands lol. I've never seen that much money in person, it's going to be exciting. Can't get too attached to it, because it goes straight to the Dr. Anyway, I just thought I would get some of this anxiousness out because it's driving my crazy. I want this day to just be here already.
