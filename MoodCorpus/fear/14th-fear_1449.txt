Nightmare
I just had the scariest dream. I wish I could quit it with the nightmares >_<
My family and I were on what seemed like a war ground. We seemed to be light hearted, even though we were being "attacked".
It was like a weird game show, you had to find the solution to the puzzle.
Ech time they catapolted something different at us. An inflated plastic bag, a ball, or the worst, a pinecone which, apon contact with the ground,  would explode, make a flash of light that temporarily blinds you, then catch on fire to the grass around it for a while.
When we saw the first pine cone we were shocked. We though, isnt this a little dangerous for a game show?
I kept marking the inflated plastic bgs, like that was the secret of the game and Id win for figuring it out. I only caught 10 of them, but I boasted that I caugh 18.

A we "waited" for the results of the game, someone said look. Someone catapolted a pinecone at our house, we didnt really care cause itd only burn for two seconds, but on looking there I noticed the other side of the house looked like it was on fire, I said:
"The house is on fire??!! Oh wait no, its not its okay" and just as I realised it wasnt, the house burst up in flames and the roof started to colapse.
My heart sunk and I thought of all my mums precious keep sakes and things as she screamed "OUR HOUSE"
Then we ran over to the house, and all started filing inside, even though it was a buring inferno that would mean instant death. I remember heading in and thinking "Im going to die" but then thinking that it was okay, because at least I would die trying to save my memories.

Then I woke up.

What a scary and stupid dream :s I hope our house doesn't catch on fire.
