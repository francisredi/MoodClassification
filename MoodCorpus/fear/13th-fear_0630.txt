WHY AM I HERE?
What a way to begin a post, but it's the truth, why am I here.  I don't want to be, I want to be somewhere else, eternal rest sounds good. My husband Leigh, is getting ready for surgery on Friday.  That will be the 1 year annaversary of my grandmother's death, it will be the annaversary of beginning of one of the worst weeks in my life.  Grandma died on March 17, 2005, my second cuz was found od'd in his apartmetn on Monday the 20th and when they went to tell his mom, my cuz, that he had od'd they found that she had as well.  3 funerals are way to many for one week.

This last weekend I went on a retreat with the women of Big Flatrock Christian Church, big mistake!  I knew 2 weeks ago that I shouldn't go, wasn't supposed to go, but being the hard headed person that I am, I didn't want mom doing it all by herself, so I signed up and went.  Won't do it again, it was for the women of the church to make a committment to being more active.  Don't think I will be back down there for a while, and doubt that I will be active if I go back, nothing more than helping out when they need it for things like VBS, chili supper & such.  Also, satan worked hard on upsetting me all weekend and so far this week, could just as easily do what my cousins did, but won't not on purpose anyway!  As much as I don't want to be here, I won't do anything to hurt Leigh.  Really I don't want to hurt the kids either.  They need one sane parent.  Unfortunately I am not that person.  If I were to talk to a mental health expert right now, they would committ me, no question!  Can't let that happen.  Will blow steam off in here and maybe write Leigh a letter, he is drinking again.  Says a little wine, more like a bottle an evening.  If he doesn't want to stop, then I might as well quit caring about my meds and what the reactions are, drop the Zocor, am already off of the Zoloft, and the rest, oh well!

Gotta run, if anyone finds and reads this, good luck and God bless!
