i'm scared i'm scared i'm scared.
i think i'm on rozs' hit list :| (literally) 
basically it's all jenny hopton's fault. gawsh, i haven't seen her for ageees and she still manages to get me into trouble. 
the story goes like this: jenny works with roz and roz asked if she knew lucy s, jenny being gay said no, but i've heard alot about her cos i used to be really close to rosie (me) and we used to chat.. roz then walked off, coming back 5mins later saying "despite woteva rosie has told u my friends r lovely people" jenny was like waaaah i didn't even say it was anything bad, just said i'd heard of her. and now i'm scared, usually i wouldn't care but roz attacked emma cruise and she the loveliest person ever!! 
i'm scared i'm scared i'm scared.
oh shit and hannah n em have left me in psych by myself the bitches (love you) 
so if i'm not answering calls tomorrow i'm in hospital. 
thankyou and goodnight. xx
