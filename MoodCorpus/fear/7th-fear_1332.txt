well, shit... what to say...

most of your all know that mark (and for those of you that dont, that is my brother) has been in and out of the hostpital for the last month, more in than out. He had a kidney transplant about  4 1/2 years ago and it is now rejecting, meaning his body is not liking the foreign object inside of it so is fighting it off like a disease. Meaning he will probably need a new kidney within the next 3-5 months, and currently I am the lucky person to get to donate to him.

dont get me wrong, I love my brother more than most people could imagine, I will do anything for him, and I am going to give him a kidney if that comes to be the case. However, I am scared, I'm scared for myself, and i'm scared even more for him, I'm hesitant because I dont know what to expect. I sort of feel guilty for being scared and hesitant, because I know what has to be done, and I shouldn't be scared, especially for myself. I was on the phone with mom today, and she asked me if this is really what I want to do, and to be 100% sure before I commit to it. I dont want to do this, I wish mark would have never had a kidney disease in the first place, I wish he could have lived a normal life, not having to worry about taking meds religously around the clock everyday of his life. But I am 100% sure that I will do this, I've never had more resolve on something in my life, he's my brother and one of two of the best friends I have, I will do anything for him.

that is what is tearing me apart I suppose, not the guilt, dont know if it is even really guilt. It is the conflict within me between 100% certain that I will do this, and being scared shitless about doing it. It is the turbulance in life that defines us, and we have to fly through the turbulance to get to where we are going.

I will try to keep you all posted on the latest.
