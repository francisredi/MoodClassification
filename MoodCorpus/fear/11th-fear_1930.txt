Finishing 3 Journal entries and writing a 5 page Euro politics paper today... made me feel SO productive. I needed to get stuff done because I have so much coming up this week. I work Thursday night and Mae will be on concert here Wednesday night. My goal is to write my other Euro Politics paper tomorrow night and then leave just 2 journal entries for Tuesday night which is very reasonable, combined with studying for Italian at some point with Christina. After Tuesday night I am going to be so happy and just stress free because Ill have only a concert, a night of work and packing to do before I go home.
       Tomorrow after Italian I am going to the towers to see if we got the circle or not. I am very nervous. We seperated into 2 groups. Group 1 is Me, Brianne, Mike and Katie and Group 2 is Jeff, Heather, Seth and Andrew. Hopefully we both get circles and can be near eachother. I don't want people calling me, i want to see it for myself. Last year I was crushed not getting a terrace suite so we better get circles this year.
       Well thats all for now. I need to hit up the gym too tomorrow, so I'll prolly do the paper after I&I at 7, hopefully I'm not up all night, and I hope my teacher accepts the approval for my suggestion to a change in the paper assignment. I don't know how my grades will be this semester, but Im going to try and bang out some good work this week  so they're not so bad I can't salvage them. That's all, Have fun everyone.
