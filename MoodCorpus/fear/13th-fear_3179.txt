Ohhhhh Canadaaaa
YEAH YEAH YEAH!!! OH, WHAT!? WHAT UP NOW!? HUH!? 

I wrote Amanda the letter, put it into pen on paper form and then went to the post office and sent it! Yeah! Now she's going to read it within a matter of days... I'm scared. Very scared. But I'm also excited. But I'm also scared. I just did something I never thought I'd do. Look at all my journal entries from the past. LOOK AT THEM. Failure after failure. So, this is what success feels like. 

I wonder what she'll say back... will she e-mail me? Write me a letter of her own? Try to call me? Will she try to let me off easy or say she feels the same way? Will it make her feel better or more depressed? 

I gotta cross my fingers on this one. I'm fully prepared for the worst. I'm not expecting anything more than that. I feel so insecure right now...

There is a list of questions I posted in a previous blog post. Tomorrow, I answer all my own questions.
