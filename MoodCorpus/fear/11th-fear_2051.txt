will you help me to understand, 'cause i've been caught in between all I wish for and all I need...
In 12 hours I will be in an all too familar place preparing to go under the knife again.  Almost a year to the day.

The only difference is, a certain too familiar person won't be there.  It's amazing how much more nervous I am because I don't have the comfort of knowing that no matter what happens, there's someone I know and I trust right there with me.  (Not that I don't trust my doctor, but you know what I mean.)

I've been trying really hard and doing a really good job of forgetting that person ever existed.  I don't talk about him, rarely think about him, and have even forgotten what he looks like.  But today I have never wanted to remember his face more, never wanted to talk to him more.  And I HATE that, but I can't help how I feel.

I know that there's a high probability I'll be fine tomorrow, but I'm still scared.  And it doesn't help that I have to fill out all these stupid papers that I never had to fill out before that decide my fate should something go wrong.  A living will, power of attorney, organ donation.  These are not things anyone wants to think about, let alone at 25 years old.  I don't know if I want a DNR.  I don't know if I become a vegetable if I want to stay on life support.  I don't know if I want to donate my heart, my kidneys, my skin, my eyes.  I don't know.  All I know is I'm becoming more and more nervous and I don't know why and it's freaking me out.

I keep telling myself I'll be okay.  In 24 hours the hard part will be over.  It will be okay.  I just hope for once in my life, I'm right.
