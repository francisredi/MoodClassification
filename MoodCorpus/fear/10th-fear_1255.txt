I am looking forward to this weekend but then again, I am not. Let me explain. This weekend is my Valentine's weekend seeing as on the actual day, me and him had to work. I am looking forward to it cause from the little bit I have been told, it seems as if I am really going to enjoy myself. But I am not looking forward to it because of all the pressure. I don't think I'll be able to perform where everyone will be happy. I know that a lot of it mostly comes from me and I should just relax and all that other crap but I just can't. And I don't care what anyone says, there is pressure. I won't elaborate at this point in time, but the pressure is there.

But I do get paid tomorrow. So that is a good thing cause I sure could use the money. Unfortunately, I have already wrote out all of my bills so I don't have that much left and I still have to get groceries and gas. I will be so happy when I can finally get to a point where I can get paid, pay my bills and still have some money. I swear, this is the downside of moving. You have too much extra stuff you have to pay for in like the first month or so. And let me tell you, I was looking forward to my refund money but the IRS is not my friend this year. I actually owe the state and I am only getting back a very (and I emphasize very) paltry some of money this year. I can't even put the amount up here, it is that sad. So , if you are interested in letting me claim Aniysha, just give me a shout out.

Well, let me go cause I do have to go to work tomorrow. Luckily, I don't have to be in until 9:00 so you know what that means . . . extra sleep!!!

Love y'all (miracles and blessings)

P.S. Eboni, you have fun in Vegas and don't forget to have enough fun for me too!!!
