As We Lose The Arguements In A Cable Car.....
sooo today is prom. i have my hair appointment at 1 and i'm kind of freaking out because i have this feeling that the hairdresser is going to take matters into her own hands and it won't look anything like the picture i have. this is based on past eperiences. plus i've never met her or seen her or the place i'm going to. 

i've gotten used to typing with acrylic nails even though it feels weird because i'm mostly using the nail and not my finger. strange.

i'm really anxious right now. and i feel i should have control over what music is being blasted through my house at the moment beause whatever the hell country music my mother is listening to just isn't doing it for me. i can barely hear mine at the moment. i truely despise whatever cd it is.

my toenails already got somewhat ruined since last night beause i'm an idiot and t ouched them before they were dry. i don't really care though since no one's going to see them. and i've made one conclusion about last night and that is freddie prinze jr. is not at all attractive.

i need to fix my necklace. i'm out.
