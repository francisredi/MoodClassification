I... gah!!!! life is funky
Okay, things have been very strange as of late.  I'm failing algebra2, ummm, I don't fail math.  Math is my "in the bag" class.  I know I've done one homework assignment sicne first quarter, but that shouldn't matter, not with me.  It's kind of destroyed me... I didn't realize it until today.  I seem to be faltering in most of my classes and really have no idea where my grades are, so I believe this progress report will be one giant attack of evil rawrness.  Another thing, my senior project keeps coming at my mind.  I think of it and it alone, yet I can't do any work because it's soo big and wide-range and scary that I don't even know where to start.  I feel like I've slipped through the cracks of everything.  Unless I'm on top of a table, screaming that I'm going to thrust a knife through my face, no one seems to even notice I exist.  It's sad, I used to live in guidance, now Mrs. Didato is too busy for me.  My teachers have basically cut off communication with me as well.  My friends want nothing more then a howdy-do and happy go lucky Bill to cheer their days, and if it becomes anything serious, it seems that they'd rather not bother.  I know I bring a ton of baggage, but just for once I wish I had someone to fight through my bullshit and actually talk to me.  Hell, make me talk, we both know I want to.  I fight like a moron for everything I don't want, and I do it to see how much people care.  Yes, I hold you to my standards!  I will fight and stick around for years, because I've made a living of it, and it's dumb, but I do it.  IDK, I guess I just needed to complain...
