Tomorrow I have the RSA course I think. I also have to ride around in the shame mobile. 

Today, was shit. The whole week has been pretty shit actually... punctuated with some good events. I'm working out uni accomodation at the moment, which is pretty stressful. Last week on friday I had my first moments of stress since the HSC, and I think I've lost my resistance towards it. It's not much of a choice... having to choose between having a life filled with stress were you can become accostomed towards it or a life without stress where you commit suicide and then hyperventilate when you encounter any stress. Stress. 

I rocked out on piano today for a while. I think i need to work on technical stuff at some point, my hands aren't in the greatest condition these days. But impro is getting pretty good. 

Il ne rien a dire... je ne sais pas si c'est correcte. Je pense que je l'ai vu dans un livre s'appelle "l'etranger". Cette anne j'ai met lots of people.

I keep thinking about how people explode everywhere when they jump off buildings. Damn you J. D. Salinger. I liked all the stuff about the flits though. The teacher was pretty cool.
