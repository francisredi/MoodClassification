I've been on this medication for about 2 weeks now. For about a week, I've had these things all over my legs and arms and some on my chest that looked like mosquito bites, and they itched like crazy. I haven't been around any mosquitos that I've noticed biting me or any other type of bugs. I was going to go to the dermatologist on Monday, because I thought it might be chiggers or red bugs from walking in the woods. I had also noticed that my stomach was upset constantly while I was on the medication.

Last night, I took it and about an hour later my heart started racing and I felt like I started to hyperventilate. That passed after about 15 minutes but it scared me shitless. Well, this morning I woke up and half of my upper lip was about 3 times as big as the other half of my upper lip and the inside of my mouth was dry, numb, and swollen. 

It turns out, I had an allergic reaction to the medication. It kept getting more severe each day I took it, culminating in the swollen mouth. Had I taken it again tonight, it probably would have caused me to have to go to the emergency room as the swelling would have spread to my throat and made it hard to breathe. I'm taking prednizone and anti-histamines now. It was scary.
