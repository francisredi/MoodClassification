Warning--bad graphic story
A horrible thing happened to day, just a little while ago.  We were on our way home tonight, just before eight, me, Husband, and the two younger kids.  It was dark out, and after we passed something dark in the road, husband said, "That was a dog."  We turned around and went back, because he had seen it still moving a little.  After we pulled over, we had to wait for a break in the traffic, with me holding my breath every time a car went by, hoping the dog wouldn't be hit again.  Finally there was an opening, and he went over to it and looked at it.  It was hurt pretty badly, and looked like its hips were maybe crushed.  Husband tried to gently to pick it up and at least get it out of immediate danger, because it was in the center of the lane, and it was a miracle it hadn't been killed yet.  The dog made this horrible noise when he tried, and moved enough that it came out of his hold.  This entire time I was on the phone trying to get a number for animal control, or anyone else I could call.  Another car was coming, and Husband was wearing black heans and a black coat, and they couldn't see him, weren't slowing at all, and I was really starting to panic when he finally jumped out of the way.  Unfortunately, the dog had managed to work itself into a sitting position, and Husband couldn't get him to move him.  The first car managed to miss the dog, but the next few didn't.  I yelled for Skinny to close his eyes, but didn't think to do it myself.  Behind my eyes now the entire scene keeps playing--the horrible thudding noise the next car made as it hit the dog, the way the dog flew and then landed, and the kept getting pushed around as the next few cars hit it.  The first car to hit it pulled over immediately, but by that time there was nothing we could do, the dog was dead.  I'm sorry if this was too graphic for anyone, I know it is awful, but I need to share it, I feel terrible.  Husband is totally blaming himself and feels even worse.
