the only way i know how to say it.....
I love mike! i have more emotions in my head with him then i ever have with any one.... he makes me wanna be a better person but with my agzity it makes me wanna run and hide from him i am so afraid that i am going to hurt him i duno there is just something in side of me that says hide pull away tell him you dont love him but for the first time in my life my heart is fighting back and telling my brain that it dosnt know and that i am just scared... with all this going on inside of me it scares me but I KNOW I WONT LET MY BRAIN WIN THIS ONE my heart knows best I LOVE HIM and he is worth fighting for internaly and exrenaly i just wish when i had my angzity atacks he wasnt around i wish i didnt feal so stupid i am afarid it will scare him away think that there is something majorly wrong with me and cetch the first bus out of here....well im scared of losing him but i am willing to go threw the inturnal strugle cause i know it is worth it,,, i know you guys how dose she know it is worth it i know becuase when he calls me babe or hun or what ever i cant help but get that tingly fealing inside... or inthe midle of the night and were sleeping he just pulls me closer to him i cant help but smile and curl in i love the way his skin feals aginst mine..... alright i am going to go i am going to have him read this and hope that maybe some of what i am going threw wont scare him becuase he will know about it cause as hard as i try the words wont come out of my mouth when he askes me what is going on or whats wrong or why i get so quite....i hope this works...
