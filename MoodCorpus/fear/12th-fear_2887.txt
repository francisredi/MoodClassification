I just thought of something that I dreamed last night... It was the only dream I had that I remember clearly, and the only dream I had with Matt in it.  It was so terrible, though... 
I was with Matt in some sort of single story building, and there were many people there for some reason, including my direct family.  After a while of general socialization, I spotted a huge vortex of air way too near to us through the window.  Everyone started screaming and I held Matt against me tightly, moving with him out the door to find some place safer.  As the tornado started getting nearer to us, though, it started to dissipate.  It vanished entirely before reaching us, and I suddenly realized that I was showing public affection for Matt in front of my parents.  I suddenly let go of him except for holding his hand and walked back inside to a corner of the room to huddle and probably to think of an excuse for holding Matt like I had... when suddenly a vortex touched down right on top of us and we died.
The last thing I did in the dream was try to publicly deny my love for the sweetest person in the world, who I should have been protecting better...  I think all this secrecy with our parents must be tearing me up psychologically... 
Also, on a creepier note, there were apparently tornados throughout southern Illinois last night, and we might have a tornado watch later tonight... As if I'm not creeped out enough already...
