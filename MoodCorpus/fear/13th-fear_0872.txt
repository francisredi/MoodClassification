Suddenly the world seems such a perfect place...
First..Kelly~ Thank you so much I love it :) You always make it look pretty :)


Tomorrow morning at 7:30 I have surgery at St. Anns.  I have to be there at 5:30 and am not allowed to eat or drink after 12 am.  I've been a bundle of nerves all day and its only getting worse as the night goes on.  I'm still in alot of pain after last night and I take my last pain pill till after surgery in a lil bit.  I hope to be home by 3 tomorrow afternoon....but it just depends on how recovery goes.  They don't know how long the surgery will last till they open me up.  Lindz stopped by tonight and we talked and it was long overdue.  I've missed her so much.  I can't wait to go to the beach with her in August.  I love summer with her and right now that gives me one more thing to look forward to after tomorrow.  I've never been to a beach before either so I'm so excited.  I doubt I'm going to be sleeping much tonight just cuz I have to be up early and with my nerves its not worth it right now.  This will prolly be the last update for a while.  Keep me in your thoughts and prayers please!
