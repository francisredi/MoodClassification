Stormy Weather.
Hi, Ho, Hi Ho, it's off to Tescos I go.  I'm about to go and do my weekend shopping, becasue I won't have time over the weekend - Daughter-dear  and I are off to an open day at Lancaster University tomorrow.  

And we are going on the boat to Heysham in the morning, to get there.  

And it is very windy.  

With lots of waves.  

And it will be rough, rough, rough.  

I feel sick thinking about it.  

I hate the boat when the sea is rough - I feel like a mouse in a cage.  And don't tell me that Ben Fogle and James Cracknell rowed across the Atlantic in a boat only marginally bigger than a shoe-box - I don't care - I still don't like it when the sea is rough!

So I won't be around on Saturday, or most of Sunday - we get the Sunday afternoon boat back.  But if you want to watch us leave then look on the Isle of Man web cam (linked just to your right, on my page), and pick Douglas Bay, about 8.45. am GMT tomorrow - it's the big blue boat!   Watch us come back on the webcam at about 5.45pm GMT on Sunday.
