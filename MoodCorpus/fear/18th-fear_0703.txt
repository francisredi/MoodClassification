London
So I will be leaving for London in a few hours. It seems like I will never make it. While I'm finishing up my packing, I'm worried I will be overweight or size on one of my bags and they will charge me for it. It's costing a bloody fortune for this trip and I'm starting to regret it. I'm sure it will be fun, but with the hassle the company has put us through, it's starting to feel like it would have been better to stay at home. Or maybe to just go to London for a month.

I got a cold or something on Sunday, so it is wiping me out. I'm either freezing or burning up, have a runny or stuffy nose, and am coughing like crazy. I'm worried about how the flight is going to effect me.

Steve has barely talked to me since he left. I'm worried he didn't have a good time and he's avoiding talking to me or maybe it's just the standard last priority. I wanted to talk last night, but he was busy with his friend and I had to pack. By the time he had time for me, I was too tired to talk for very long. Today, we have barely talked at all. It's been short calls about one thing or another. He said he was planning on doing stuff with his friend today. That really upset me. I realize he has other things to do, but I'm leaving the country for three months. This is the last afternoon we will be in the same time zone until we get back to school. He's not going to have the time to talk to me because his hours won't accommodate mine. I'm also worried he will find someone knew in Connecticut. Someone with an interest in sports who likes all the things he likes. He's always saying we don't have much in common. I just don't think I can deal with the typical "should we be together" summer conversations.  Why does everyone else know they are perfect for each other and we just can't seem to click?

Well, I guess I should get off the computer so it can finish burning. Once it does that, I can finish packing my carryon and get on my way.

Bye.
