The beginning of this weekend was precisely what the doctor ordered. So much fun and for truly the first time in a long time I felt like the old me. Sunday wasn't so great. I try really hard not to piss people off that I love, but apparently I did anyway, and it hurts. That was just the tip of the iceberg that was Sunday.
So I have depositions on Thursday. I'm quite scared of even the thought of having to go through them. It really hit me today. I have to see him, though not in person, but even still the fact that I have to look at him, even once, terrifies and disgusts me. I've been looking for any distractions I can find to avoid the fact that I have prepare myself for the inevitable. I have to be strong, I have to find my voice and I have to suck it up, no matter how awful, and face him. I'm trying to condition myself to be able to face him, it really has just lead me to a panic attack and a sleepless night. I have too much stuff going on that is keeping me from preparing for my day. I've been on the verge of tears all day, and I don't know how much longer I can keep up with this. It's a lot harder than I anticipated and a lot harder than I can handle right now. Most of me wants to just run away like I always do, but there's still a little bit of the feisty, no-nonsense Sara left that won't let me go down without a fight. I just wish I wasn't so fucking paranoid about everything else. I'm a wuss, I really am, I'm not a strong person, I just pretend like I am.
