After all, tomorrow is another day...
OK, so I am a little slow on getting my shit together. I have plans though! Today will mark my last day of smoking, if all goes well. If I can go 3 days without smoking, I'm in the clear. After detoxing for a few weeks, I'll attack the next vice: Pepsi! And again, as long as all goes well on both counts, I plan on starting a regular exercise routine daily, not only to lose a few pounds, but to help achieve my Marky Mark abs!

Did I accomplish any goals yesterday? Well I did do some laundry, and I'd like to think that counts, as I am looking to accomplish something, anything every single day (aside from getting out of bed) although sometimes I consider that an accomplishment too!

Have a visit with my psychologist planned for Monday, another visit, another day I keep my fingers crossed that he doesn't tell me that I'm insane, but I'm not holding my breath.

Got some good new late last night, and if all goes well, I may be sleeping somewhere other than the broken old futon in the basement next Saturday night(no not in the same bed with my wife, as that would take some kind of miracle at this point)Keep your fingers crossed, I know I am!

Well another Sunday morning at work ahead, with nothing to do but sit at alone and think about my situation here at home (sigh) Perhaps my wife will send me some good news, I'll check my inbox all day long, but much like the insane thing, I shan't hold my breath.
