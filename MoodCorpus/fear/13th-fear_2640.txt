ugh, i need to get this off my chest
I am absolutely terrified that I might get breast cancer. I don't know how all of this came about, but lately I've been thinking about how I can possibly carry the gene and possibly get it. It runs in my family; my grandmother died from it. I know that there are treatments that can possibly beat it and everything, but I also know that many women have died from it and i definitly am not ready to die. I'm so scared. Like, I honestly don't think anyone understands how terrified I am of it. I want to talk to Rocco about it cuz he always seems to ease my mind about everything, but I always come to him about this and how I feel fat and how school is a pain in the ass, and I'm starting to believe that I am beginning to drive him away from me because of it. I can't afford to loose him. He is my best friend and the one person I go to about everything without him I won't have anyone to talk to or confide in. It sucks so much because I have reached that point in my life where I am so scared of dieing. I have the urge to do everything I can in life and since I havent yet the thought of me dieing upsets me so much. 


ok, i think thats enough.
