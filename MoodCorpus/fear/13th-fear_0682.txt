gosh...
i have to call the big scary drilling men and tell them that i can't give them the contract they wanted for a supplier 'like last week' because they need to analyse the rates this supplier is calling for to make sure we are protecting the company.

i'm nervous. these are big scary drilling men who hate me already cause they wanted that contract like last week (everything they want, they want like yesterday) and the work is important and i can jeopardize every and anything if i don't have the contract on their desk NOW, and what is it i'm asking them for AGAIN, why am i delaying their work, i'm just a little girl and they're tired of me stalling their important big scary work...

i have to call them.

the company lawyer who told me to call them and get this information before releasing the contract looked at me like, "i feel so sorry for you, but i'm glad it's you and not me!"

i can be stone faced and just say "this is what i need, this is what i need, this is what i need, this is what i need, nothing doing till i get this, nothing doing till i get this." but i've been advised to be diplomatic in speaking to them, and that's why i'm nervous. cause i have to form diplomatic phrases in my mind. sigh. diplomacy is the devil.

and the more i linger, the more nervous i get...
