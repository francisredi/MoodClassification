A Question I'm Sure Many Ask
On discussing Supernatural:

MuffyTaj: I am a film student.  We don't GET scared by films
MuffyTaj: Except when I was hanging out at Jenny's house and screamed during an episode of Goosebumps
MuffyTaj: Which was just humiliating
Lunar: LMFAO YOU ARE KIDDING ME
MuffyTaj: SHUT UP
MuffyTaj: DON'T MOCK ME
Lunar: OH MY GOD
MuffyTaj: IT WAS SCARY
Lunar: I AM SECURE IN BEING AFRAID OF THE RING NOW, FOR EVER AND EVER AND EVER, YOU CAN'T TAUNT ME WITH IT AHAHAHAHAHA
MuffyTaj: SHUT UUUUUUP
Lunar: ehehehehehe that's fucking hilarious
MuffyTaj: At least I am not scared of wells
MuffyTaj: It was an episode about a plant man
MuffyTaj: I find plants scary
MuffyTaj: The plants were evil!  Evil and scary!  It was late at night!  It was dark!  WAAAAH
Lunar: I'm not scared of wells, I'm scared of creepy little ghost girls that happen to have psychiatic issues. MAJOR issues.
Lunar: lmfao sure dude
Lunar: whatever you say
MuffyTaj: I watched the ring in the dark in a practically empty house and the phone rang and I was fine
MuffyTaj: a plant man from goosebumps, on the other hand, made me scream
MuffyTaj: what is WRONG with me?!
