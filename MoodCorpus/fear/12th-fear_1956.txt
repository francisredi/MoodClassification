Succumbing to pressure, plus nerves
So everyone keeps mentioning MySpace, so I caved in and got one http://www.myspace.com/miyuhime . Although Im not impressed so far What does it have that LJ doesn't?

Got my certification test tomorrow morning. Im sure Ill do ok, but I get nervous easily. I don't test well. I was one of those folks who coasted thru elementary and Jr High and most of High school without the need to study.  But the time came when my brain didn't remember everything and I didn't know how to study...I still don't know how, but hopefully somethings have stuck. But just cuz I have it memorized now means nothing tomorrow.  The written is where I worry, because I suck at writing things out - Im great if I can talk it out. But this one wants you to remember things in order and I think Ive got it....well I DO have it, at this moment. No guarantees later.

Im babbling and I know it. I will go to bed after this and hope I will sleep. I never sleep when Im nervous.
