Tumor Countdown 06!!!
So I haven't updated this thing in a while and God knows I don't want to study for my Spanish test so I figured this was a good last resort. And then I had an idea. Tumor Countdown!!!!!!!!!! (06'!)

So on Tuesday I went to the doctor cause I found this lump under my arm (also known as "my tumor") and my doctor was all like "Surprise! You have two other lumps on your body too!" She thinks the other two are just swollen lymphnodes but she was like "shyeet Alyssa, we're gunna put you on some medication for ten days to see if that big lump (my tumor) goes away." And then I was like, "Dr. Raphols, what will we do if it doesn't go away (this is a team effort you know)?" and she was like "weeeeeeeeeelllllll meh meh meh blah blah we'll have a surgeon look at and you'll get some surgery or some shyeet like that yo."

And so here is where my "Tumor Countdown" comes into play. For the next ten days I will update my journal each day alerting the public of the state of my tumor's presence. If by day ten that shit aint gone, let's all assume I have cancer and stock up on pot...medicinal pot. Mmmm.


Ok. So here it goes.

TUMOR COUNTDOWN DAY 1:
The tumor is still present. Rome wasn't built in a day though!

Love,
Alyssa
