Let me get this straight, I'm not mad at Greg.  Maybe if there was something ever between us, yes I would be upset, but there never was.  If anything I'm just hurt and understandably so.  I'm not mad at any one and I don't hate any one.  I'm just hurt and pretty upset with myself.  I shouldn't have expected anything, it's just a fact of life that I'm not meant to have a boyfriend right now.  And yeah, knowing that really hurts.  And I don't care what people say, there is something wrong with me.  Period.  My first boyfriend dumped me because I wasn't pretty enough for him, I screwed up my second relationship, and now I'm just a friend to everyone.  Which don't get me wrong, I enjoy being a friend, but sometimes you need to feel wanted, sometimes it's nice to feel pretty, every once in a while it's nice to know someone is thinking of you.  And my mom keeps telling me that I don't need a smelly boy to be happy about myself and I know that, but again how can I feel happy about myslef when I feel like no one else notices me?  I'm just plain, not drop dead gorgeous, not super smart, not all that funny, there's just nothing real special about me.  Sure I'm a nice person or whatever, but there are plenty of nice people out there, there are plenty of people who listen to people, there are plenty of Sarah's out there and i can garuntee they are better than me.  I'm just me and apparently that's not enough for any one.  And this isn't just because of the whole Greg thing, because I am interested in other people, I have been for a while now, but again, I'm nothing that special.  And as a little side note for certain people, there are other people in this world who are lonely and have a horrible home life.  They just don't go flaunting it around for all to see.  Some of the struggles some go through are best kept to themselves because they are truly struggles and they are painful.
