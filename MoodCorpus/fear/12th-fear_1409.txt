Life
It's rough man.  The fuse was not the magic Parr reactor solution that I had hoped for, so I guess I have to call Conan again tomorrow.  Eventually we will figure this problem out, I hope.  In the meantime, all I can do is sigh and wish it was fixed.  I also tried to recrystallize something today that I haven't recrystallized before and it was not as straight-forward as I had hoped.  Nothing ever is, I guess.  Also, I still haven't picked a seminar topic and my cold is only a teeny bit better.

In the good news department, I had a lovely weekend.  On Friday night, I went to the formal and a ton of people I really like went, so it was awesome.  I only had 2 drinks - I think I was still recovering from the previous night's hangover.  However, I did dance all night which made it great.  Just like prom, but with booze.   Then, on Saturday morning, I scheduled my audition for Stanford Aerobics and Yoga!  That means that on Thursday, I'll be teaching a full class.  The audition is so that the people who run SAY can decide if I'm ready to have my own class.  If I am ready, then I get a class!  I'm really nervous about the audition but it would be really fun to have a class to teach.  And one would be the perfect number for next quarter because then I could really concentrate on it.  Then as I get better, I could try to pick up more classes.  Unfortunately, the audition is this week.  I know, I know, timing on everything is bad isn't it?  It makes this week a little busy since I'm giving group meeting on Wednesday and auditioning on Thursday.  Plus, I need to start working on my seminar and I've got some calculations that better start running.  Anyway, now that I've whined sufficiently, feel bad for me please!
