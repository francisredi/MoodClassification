Sigh. I'm nervous about going to Spain. Don't get me wrong - I cannot wait to go and I think that once I get there I am going to regret not going for an entire semester, but I'm still nervous.
I'm worried that I'm going to get there and I'm not going to understand anyone and when I try to speak people are going to be like, "Who the hell is this asshole and why is he butchering our language"
Because honestly, every time you have a teacher at college who doesn't speak English as their first language aren't you annoyed? I mean I get past it but don't you sometimes just feel a little bit annoyed? And I care way too much about what other people think of me so that's going to bother me.
I'm also nervous about flying. I can deal with cross country flights and I'm good usually once i'm in the air, but the thought of flying over the ocean with nowhere to land just scares me. Plus, after hearing about Lauren's horror story in travelling i freaked for the whole day. In fact I'm freaking myself out now so I have to stop this train of thought.
I'm worried about not fitting in either. It's bad enough I have so few friends at school but now I'm gonna be in a completely different country with a different culture, language and family. God, I'm going to be living with a family, that's scary too.

And do I tell anyone? Of course not. But I write it out and it helps.

I rented TransAmerica tonight from MovieWorks, anyone wanna watch it tomorrow?
