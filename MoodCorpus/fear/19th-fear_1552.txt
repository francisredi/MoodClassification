Nervous flyer - right here.
So I leave on Monday. I hate flying. I mean it's great looking out the window at all the pretty clouds, but I'm the one chewing gum non-stop, twiddling my fingers, and totally thinking about something else. 

So what happens today? I go and check on my stepdad who's eating toast and peanut butter around lunch, which was making me happy. I asking him what he's watching on tv and it's the discovery channel with a special on plane crashes. Great... Watching tv later - Final Destination's on tv. Lovely. 

I guess I'm nervous about travelling away from my family because as a young children, my mother would leave without telling me where she was going or for how long. I would always cry and miss her. My dad was never around once he left me and my mom, and the stepfather's no help - he very serious and strict. I just worry alot, that's all. Worry and get sad and nervous and stuff. I hate it so much. It gets to a point where I get so nervous, I start to feel sick and get headaches.
