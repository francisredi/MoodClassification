Afraid to go public
So this is it.  I'm posting my first public entry.  How lame am I to be freaked out that the entire universe can see what's going on in my pea-sized brain?  And how unbelievably egocentric to think that even one person out there would A) find this entry and B) read it.  But the more I thought about why I haven't made my (admittedly few) entries public, the more I couldn't think of a real answer.  Is it the Internet Bogeyman?  We all hear the horror stories of poor Jane Doe and how she went online for the first time in her life, and was phished or her identity stolen or blah blah blah.  Why would I be afraid of that?  I'm a relatively savvy person and I'd like to think I'm smart enough to NOT give out my social security number to the first person that asks me for it.  No, I don't think I'm worried about what people will take from me.

I think I'm worried what I'm giving people.

When you write in a for-my-eyes-only journal, it's exactly that - just for you.  You can read it and savor your words.  You can wax nostalgic over things that are silly.  But when you put that same stuff where someone else... someone who doesn't know you (or even more horrifying... someone who does!) can see it; something is lost.  It's not yours any more.  Or, until about an hour ago, that's how I felt.  But for all the years that I've sporadically written down what goes on in my pea-sized brain, it's not helped me or given me some sort of catharsis.  It's just me writing about things that happen in my relatively un-eventful life.

So I've decided to try something new.  I'll write what's going on in my head.  Sometimes I'll stick it out there for everyone.  Sometimes I'll let my friends see.  Occasionally I'll keep it private.  But I won't be afraid any longer.  I hope.
