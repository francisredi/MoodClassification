AHHH
SO I don't feel safe driving right now ... I know it's that whole Franklin mentality thing that I have going but ice isn't my friend ... hell water alone isn't my friend.  I'm scared and I don't want to hurt my car in anyway ... what's so wrong with wanting to be careful.  My grandma just told me I was going to lose my job just cause I am being caustious ... I need out of the house and yet I am too scared to leave.  I don't like winter weather and I don't like the fact that the road in front of my house is white.  I woke up at 5 this morning and got all ready for work ... so I sure did plan on going but now it's another story completely cause it's fucking icy outside.  It's fine and dandy that everybody else can go out and make it safe to work but when I call in and the people I talk to says it's slick then I know I have a reason to be scared.  What's so fucking wrong with being scared?  I don't want to hurt myself or my car ... what's so wrong with being careful?
