So close. So far. Friday is the day. to say that I'm scared is an understatement. I'm actually quite terrified. my friend Laura got waitlisted. She has much more experience than me. Grant seems to think I'll be fine as long as I get across how much I desire this. I have so much to accomplish in a short amount of time. The most stressful time of my life I am expected to do well on two important exams and write a literature paper and be prepared to discuss a topic of Polish history that I haven't found yet. I need this semester to be over. I want to prepare for next year. I am sick of this semester already. Everything is hitting at once. Tomorrow I have to go to lab since I won't be there on friday which takes away from study time. Thursday and Friday are pretty much dead days to me. I won't be able to do much of anything those days.
So yeah. thats my life as of right now. I just want to lie in the warmth of my bed, and collapse eating milano cookies.
