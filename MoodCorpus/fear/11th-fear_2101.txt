my day
I had a pretty crummy day today.

I had my midterm in physiology this morning and that really sucked.

this afternoon I had to get my blood drawn and my veins were small (they always are) and we ended up having to use my left arm, and 3 hours later I still feel like there is a needle in there, it hurts every time I bend it. owwwiieeee.

then came my Dr's appt. Riley is doing great. I am not so great. My pap came back abnormal, I have to have a colposcopy done. I go back after my 20 week ultrasound for the colposcopy. I'm quite nervous about this. I'm petrified of a biopsy from my cervix while I'm pregnant. She said I do have a yeast infection and I have HPV so those could be causing the abnormal pap. I'm pretty freaked out and am going to have to wait a while for the results. this really sucks.

she gave me 3 prescriptions (asthma, mirgane and yest medicine) and tells me that my presumptive elegibility will cover these, I get to walgreens and they say no it won't. I'm so frustrated. 

so yeah that is my crummy day, and now I'm complaining to the world of live journal of it (after having already vented to my husband, daughter(she didn't get it) and mother)

oh and something else, she said my german mesels came back as showing I haven't had a vaccine in too long so I have to get that vaccine again after Riley is born, and that I'm O+ I didn't know that I had O, that's pretty rare and kinda sucks, knew about the + part though.
