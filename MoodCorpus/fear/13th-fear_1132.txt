Ex-Husband
My ex-husband called today and asked to speak to the 15yo. When they got done talking the 15yo told me his dad will be moving here this weekend. It seems his new wife just got promoted by the grocery store she works for and she will now be working in San Antonio... Of course where they live now is approximately the same distance from San Antonio as San Marcos is, so that leaves only one reason for him to move here. No, it's not to be near his son... He couldn't sign away custody fast enough once he understood that I wouldn't tolerate him maintaining custody if the 15yo was going to live with me. He actually told me he would have the kid institutionalized before he'd have the kid live with him again.

In the time I was married to him he sexually abused me in some pretty awful ways. He verbally and emotionally abused me as well. He continues to verbally and emotionally abuse our children and based on the way the 15yo was sexually acting out before he moved here I'm worried he may have sexually abused the 15yo also. Since I left him he has done everything in his power to make my life hell. First he grabed the kids and moved to Michigan where he almost completely kept me from having any contact with them for two years. He told the kids that I didn't love them anymore and instructed them to refer to me by my first name and call his new girlfriend "mommy." During the custody hearing he provided my attorney with proof that I'm bi and poly and threatened to take it to the judge, causing me to lose custody of my kids. My 14yo daughter won't even tell me she loves me if he's within earshot. On the rare occassions I am able to get her on the phone he refuses to allow her to speak to me unless she's sitting right next to him.

So the only reason for him to be moving here is to continue making my life hell. I'm so upset I feel sick. I can't believe he's doing this.
