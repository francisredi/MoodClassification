scary!!!
So I'm still back at home on "vacation" in Monterey (right on the beach in Pacific Grove to be exact), and today I was seriously afraid to go outside.  This morning the city issued out a warning for a pack of wild mountain lions that are supposedly right down the street from me attacking the deer at night, but during the day they hide so nobody can find them.  There are these wild mountain-lion warnings every year, and every year somebody get clawed and dies while jogging along the beach.  
Then later today I took a jog on the beach (haha stupid me) and I ran up to about 10 cop cars and 2 ambulances and they were shining search lights into the water.  I asked them what was going on and they said there was a huge shark attack and a kayaker and a surfer were missing. Eaten alive, obviously.  
I just want to go outside without being eaten or clawed, for christ's sake!

p.s. i just ordered chinese food. yayyyy.
