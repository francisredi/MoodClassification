Is it any wonder I'm tired, is it any wonder that I feel uptight
I hate school.
For real, it's taking over, consuming, and swallowing my life whole like a huge orca whale and krill.
I always have so much stuff to do now.
Before, I got to take like hour long naps, now it's cut to 25 minutes maximum.
Plus, all my teachers are loading it on like the middle of the year.
I don't care that there is children starving in Africa, this still sucks.
I always wonder to myself why I do this.
If it were any other situation, I would totally be out of this schedule quickly.
Also, my addiction to coffee has risen greatly.
I now moved from my two cups minimum to four.
Damn it.
I'm so anxious and overwhelmed recently.
I was home for a total of 7 hours this past weekend, which included sleeping.
I'm always crazy obnoxious now too.
I just want to scream so loud that I wouldn't be able to hear myself.
I want to scream into an infinite abyss.
