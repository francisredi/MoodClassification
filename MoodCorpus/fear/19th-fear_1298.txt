            Ok so we had suspicions that Duke was cut proud ( meaning when he was gelded, it wasnt complete so the hormone that says he is still a stallion is there), and we were right.  I found out today that he tried to mount the black and white paint mare ( who has a two week old foal) FOUR TIMES!!! So he was put in a stall dirty , cut on one side , and upset and wanting to be with the other horses . He calmed down when I spoke quietly and stroked him. At that point I didnt know what was wrong why he was dirty and upset. It bothers me that she didnt call me right away. &gt;.&lt; but I just asked her to next time. Now I have a half- *** stallion. a gelding that acts like a stallion. loverly. I stil love him, but Im afraid Im not experienced enough to handle a stallion, technically in his mind. Any suggestions on how to handle a hiked up stallion? Galloping off till next time...
