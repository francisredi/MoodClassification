can't sleep..
Yes, I'm 18 years old and I'm still afraid of the dark, lol. Bryan shut all the lights off in the house and I ended up falling asleep fairly early. I woke up an hour later from a really bad nightmare. Then I looked around me and started to see shit. That's when I woke Bryan up. He wasn't too helpful because he was half asleep, so I started freaking out. Thank God for my best friend Meghan. She calmed me down and now I'm just chillen. Yeeeaahh so I've been up ever since that little incident. 
  I have severe anxiety problems and sometimes I just snap...like tonight. Whenever I'm under alot of stress, I try coping as best as possible but then it hits me when I least expect it. I was supposed to help my mom move into her new apartment today but I had no way of getting over there. She wanted me to be in charge of everything since she was at work, but since I wasn't able to be there everything fell apart. No one ended up showing up to help, and it made me feel like absolute shit. I guess that had alot to do with the whole ordeal tonight.
