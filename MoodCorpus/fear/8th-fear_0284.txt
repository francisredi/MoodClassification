OMG! What have I gotten myself into?
So....It looks like I will be involved in the start up of an artists co-op gallery.

eeeeeeeee......*running for the hills*

Dont get me wrong, I think this an awesome opportunity and I am not afraid of a lot of work (and by a lot I mean A LOT), or of the expense (it will cost a fair bit of change). It will be a good thing and I am trying to be optimistic.

BUT IM A PESSIMIST! I ALWAYS SEE THE DARKER SIDE OF LIFE! I can already plot 10 different ways this thing will crash and burn. Ah well. I am taking a deep breath and saying hopeful things. I am excited but scared, calm but nervous ... ok more nervous than calm. I hate putting a lot of effort into something only to have it fail. Also since im a control freak I dont relinquish control easily. I can comprimise and I think im a good communicator and comprimisor (that is totally not spelled right). I guess I have just gotten to a place in my life that I feel like if im prepared for failure I will be pleasantly surprised when it succeeds instead of depressed and surprised when it goes in the dumpster. Chalk it up to years of build op of thick skin.

I dont know. We shall see how it goes.
