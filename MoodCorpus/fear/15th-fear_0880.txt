i freaked
I went to my aunt caroline and uncle larrys today.  I havent seen them in almost 2 years or so.  They just had a baby.  I found out she was due at the exact same time i would have been.  I saw the baby and my throat locked up.  I got sweaty and pale.  I sat down right away and my mom kept staring at me.  She held the baby and was cooing and ga-gaing over it.  I wanted to run away.  At one point my uncle was holding her and asked if i wanted to.  I paniced and refused adamantly.  I said she was too fragile and i would stick with animals- using it as a cover since no one in my famuly knows what i did.  He said she wasn't that fragile and stood up to bring her too me.  I started stuttering and got up and moved away from him.  I said she had just eaten and projectile vomit and i didnt work together at all.  He said she was too little to do it and asked why i was so nervous.  I just kept saying i didnt want to hurt her.  He finally relaxed and said it was ok and sat back down.  I excused myself and went on a 45 minute walk.

I dont think ive ever been that terrified. I didnt even want to look at her.  A little girl named Meghan.  All i know is that i dont want to go back there again.  And i want to rip out my ovaries and never look at another baby.  Somethings wrong with me.
