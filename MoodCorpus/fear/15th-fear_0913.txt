Sheep Monsters (FFIX)
Last night me and Michael went and saw Silent Hill, though it was a decent adaptation from the games. I was kind of left a little dissapointed. Though the ending could spell out "sequal"?

But the real excitement happend after the movie, at 11 o' clock, when he drove me home. After I wave him off and walk into my house, I take a couple of steps and hear an giant crash, an moan from metal, a sound of a large glass shattering, and the words: "MONTE GET OUTSIDE NOW!"

Terrified and knowing the possibilities that could have been behind the other side of my front door, I open to see that he had knocked over a streetlamp just a few houses down. (perfect walking distance). I run over and am relieved to find him cursing and screaming at a styrofoam cup that distracted him by falling out of his cup-holder whilst he was trying to make a turn.

Eventually the plolice, towtrucks and parents arrived. Mine second. They just got back from the benifit and Will came over and talked with the neighbors and tried to find a reasonable solution to the problem. Micheal's and My parents met for the first time that night. 

Needless to say, he won't be using that car at night. Let alone any car at night. (Also, no drinks in your car.)

I was so freaking scared that he had hurt himself. It was crazy. I didn't go to bed till 2 in the morning.

Lesson learned: "NO DISTRACTIONS IN CAR!"

(For details, just ask.)
