Tore up...
Alright... I love him so much. Well I don't know. I am so confused right now. I hate being a girl. Check it out. I'm 18 years old, always been too "smart" for a serious relationship, so I've always kinda dated around. Well this special guy comes into my life, and I'm too scared to let myself fall for him so I push him away. Now I'm scared. Scared it is too late to have him, afraid he has moved on... I don't know what to do. I'm so PISSED @ myself for letting him go... There may still be a chance but only if I get the balls to tell him how I feel, and good luck on that one. I just don't wanna get my heart broken, although I can't see it feeling any worse than it does right now. Too many people I care about have been through hell. I wanna get married, I wanna fall in love, I wanna find that person... I just don't know how I am ever going to take that first leap of faith. Once I'm through with that I will be fine. I know I will... but until then, what do I do????
