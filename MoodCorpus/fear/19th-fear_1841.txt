Jobs
Gah... I desperately need a job, since my computer's almost literally exploding, and I just don't have the $1874 I need to replace it.  Problem is, I have practically no self-confidence.  I don't know why, but I'm completely terrified of going around and asking for a job.  Maybe it's because I'm afraid I won't be good enough, and I'll not get hired anywhere?  I mean, I know I'm smarter, and probably more personable, than around 90% of the kids who actually have jobs, but I'm just so scared of actually going out and getting one.  And my mom's not helping at all - she just keeps bitching about how I've waited too long, and that I'm lazy and have no ambition, and that I'm basically never going to get anywhere with my life.  That's about the last thing I need.  And she won't drive me places, so now this weekend I have to bike several miles just to find some places to apply, and I'm really gonna make a great impression when I walk in sweating my ass off.  I could also take the bus, but I have no idea when or where it stops, or how much it'll cost.  And chances are the job I get won't pay anything even remotely near $1874, even before taxes, so I can't afford to spend any of it on bus fares, so I'll have to bike to work almost every day.  Hell, I'll be lucky to make $500.  I'm so screwed.
