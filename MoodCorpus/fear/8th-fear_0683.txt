ok. so am big nerd.
alright, watching channel 19, and the winter concert. i'll admit it, i'm a nerd. i see myself on tv, and i have to watch. unless i'm singing/acting. that i can't watch myself do, i'm too embarrassed. 

shock is starting to set in for me that on saturday i'm going to be competing against sophomores AND freshmen for the NATs winning title, whatever that is. and i'm not ready for it. i mean yeah, i know the songs, i know the words, i have the musicality, the facial expression, but i don't have any movements of my arms or walking or anything. and i know if i don't get that all down now, i'll be too nervous in the audition room to do anything about it. i wish i could just let go for things like that, just totally be the character and everything, but i feel like an idiot when i do. even though people say i was good, i just hate to do it.  i just can't let go of myself and assume a different persona long enough to be convincing. i'm just anxious for saturday to come so i can get this over with and start on the NEXT singing thingy, which is the associated board exam in march. scary, nitpicky, stuck-up british people grading you, without allowing for human error. i feel like i have to get 100%. i need to. 

and i really wanted the damn solo for danse baccanale in freshman winds. it's really awesome and arabian sounding. it's written for sax and oboe, so naturally mrs walton gives it to the oboist, rachel. nothing against her, because she's good, and she's really nice, but she can't play that solo. none of the grace notes, it's off pitch, whatnot, to make a short story shorter i think i should be the one playing it. i don't care what that last statement makes you think of me. that's the way i see it.

and my dog's been biting REALLY hard lately. my hands are all red and scratched from his little needle-like teeth. owie-zowies.
