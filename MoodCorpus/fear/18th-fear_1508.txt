Goddamn. First I want to flunk my classes, and now I have this sudden urge to drink/smoke weed/do drugs. I fail. Ironically, we re-took this drug survey in history today. It was pretty retarded. It was mainly "in the past 30 days, did you use _____?" So it basically was like me checking off "no" like a million times.

Like I will actually do drugs, though. I'm 100% sure that I won't. I'm too scared of becoming addicted; I'm already addicted to too many things already. It just feels like I need to relax and not think about how incredibly stupid my story was that I turned in today, and I need my escape from reality to be completely out of my own control. And yes, I do get stressed out over the most retarded things.

So, it's time for the better alternative. The most hardcore-liek-woah South Park shit to ever walk the earth. And hell, do I need it. For one thing, it's fucking Friday. I turned in that report so I don't have to worry anymore. But even more importantly, I have to get working on that fanfic for Charley. Because she likes fanfiction now, especially the whack kind, and I'm going to take as much advantage of that as possible. 

IT'S GONNA BE A KENNY/MR. SLAVE. 

WERD.
