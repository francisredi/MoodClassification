What to do.... what to do....
Ok, I have a dilemma. One of my rats, Molly, has a tumor. An enormous tumor. I decided when I first noticed it that I wasn't going to have it removed because she is over 2 years old. I just felt like that would be a crappy thing to do to her and she's already pretty old for a rat; in other words I didn't want to do the surgery and then have her die a month later.

Well, it's been like, 2 months now, and the tumor is really big. And I feel SO guilty about it. She still has lots of energy and is still interested in food and exploring and stuff, but she is losing weight. Last night I decided I couldn't live with the guilt anymore and I needed to do something about it. But now I'm not sure what the right course is... my boyfriend thinks I should just have her put down (which I REFUSE to do utnil she obviously has no chance for quality life anymore). I could just leave things the way they are now, and she'll eventually be like Eleanor was at the end; when I had her put down. I've been thinking I should just take her in and have it removed, but I am worried it may be too late now. She is old, she's lost a lot of weight, and the tumor is pretty big. Like, the size of a golf ball. Right in her armpit. AHHHHHHH! What do I do??
