Interview and Weight Report
Waist: 43 inches
Weight: 245 pounds.

Okay, I REALLY don't know what I'm doing anymore. I know this week I was lax, and I'm glad I didn't go over 245 pounds, but could someone explain this to me? 

How could I gain so many inches in such a short time, literally overnight, not lose weight but gain it, and not look like I've gained anything, but lost some about the waist, AND have my clothes fit much the same as they did before? 

I just don't understand it. I'm past frustration and anger now and I've delved directly into the land of confusion. I eat less than 2200 calories a day, and drink plenty of water, and I don't eat anywhere near as much as I do while on shift. Mind you, sleep is still an issue for me, a very big issue, as it's just plain hard for me to get anymore than five hours a day. I also think my lack of swimming has to do with it, and so next week, I intend to go swimming first thing in the morning, like I used to, and get back into shape. That's the best thing a person can do.

Now, tomorrow, I'll be going to Vancouver for my JET Programme interview, and I have my papers ready to go, but I'm still nervous. I feel as though I'm going to screw up even the simplest of things, despite my best planning. I have nice clothing to wear, I'm shaved, and I have experience, plus I will have my degree in late April, a copy of which I have to send to them as soon as I get it.

Everything is as prepared as it is going to be. I have only to do my best.

Now if only I would stop being so bloody nervous. >_<
