I see the bad moon arising...
This week has been busy and thank god for that because if I would have to sit here and constantly think about the money I don't have for school - I think I'd probably wind up killing myself.

I called on Tuesday and they told me (PHEAA) that I was not eligible for any aid from the state. Whereas my school told it was just the Pell Grant, so Wilkes told me to call back in a week to see if anything was taken care of it - finanical aid wise, I'm really nervous but I've learned to hide my feelings my parents so well, so they think it isn't bothering me. Work has helped, Tuesday I was at the losest I've ever been. I wanted to call off work so bad - but I got out of bed, took a shower, and went to work and ya know? I'm proud of myself for making me get up because it at least pre-occupied my time with something to get my mind off of it.

The specialist my mom was supposed to see for her knee wasn't covered by our insurance, so her appointment is pushed back even longer. This time she has to go all the way into Bethelhem to see one, and then go St. Joe's for the surgery if she needs it.

On my way home tonight I almost hit a deer, I'm still a little shaken about it since it is the same spot where my dad hit his a few years ago. Not to mention, I got like 6 hours of sleep last night, which is not enough for me. I went to bed at 2am because I was working on the Sons of a Carpenter presentation for Saturday and then Gail woke me up with a phone at 8am about it, and then I couldn't go back to sleep.

But in all this dark gloomy stuff that has been happening lately there is an upside - I called Mr. Sharadin back about the Folk Fesitival and he told me was going to hire me as a consultant the week before the fesitival to get things started and then I will be working at the fesitvial when I can. I told Joanne and she is willing to work around my FF schedule for work, which is nice since I'll probably get more money from FF anyway.
