The Secret...



Dick had once posed to Bruce a couple of years ago that "a lot of people knew our secret-Ra's al Ghul; the Riddler; too many of our allies, and now an angry civilian." Though, at the time, the "angry civilian" had been my late father, Jack Drake. 

Now, another civilian knows our secret-Bruce's significant other. I'm not saying that I'm against someone close to us knowing this-but, from what I've found out as a result of Bruce's birthday party/New Year's celebration, there's another Batman in town-Bruce's biological son, Alistair Wayne-or, Alex, as he prefers to go by-and, he's from the future. 

(smirks faintly) Yeah-that little tidbit I know about. It may not have been information personally divulged to me, but this will indeed be locked away under the things I'm supposed to pretend I don't know. 

I can't help but be concerned-with such a multitude of people who know our secret, what are the chances that someone as insane as Killer Croc, Deathstroke, Luthor, or the Joker were to capture Christine, or anyone else who knew our secret and were able to torture them to find out? How strong-willed could they be in order to keep that information from being revealed? 

Maybe I'm just jumping to conclusions after having been in the 'Haven for a year. Still, those doubts are going to be in my mind for some time to come...
