AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!
I am so scared and nervous right now because I just found out when I'm taking my third party test.  Next Saturday the 18th I'm taking my road skills test with Tom Ranta.  Talk about scary.  I hope I don't fail.  I don't know what to expect and I am very bad at parking so I hope I can pass my parking.  I don't know how to react right now.  Part of me is nervous, part of me is excited and part of me is saying that I'm going to fail.  Anyways...

I am feeling much better today.  I lived on popsicles, fudgesicles, and saltine crackers yesterday because those were the only things that I could stomach.  Today I don't have much of an appetite which is ok because I don't feel like I have to puke anymore.  I turned in applications to Pizza Hut, Dollar Tree, Bonanza, and the Villa.  Hopefully I'll get a call from them.  I'm also going on vacation in April and I'll have to miss like 3 or 4 days of school.  We're going over Easter to Tennessee.  I'm excited but I'm not excited about having to put our dog in the kennel.  I'm hoping I can find a house sitter for my babies.  If anyone is interested please let me know.  Well I gotta go...gonna practice for my test.
