"I'm so tired and turned around and scared."
Today's subject title for my update is actually from a song by Rise Against called "Anywhere but here." The song, and this lyric specifically, seems to hit rather hard for me today. Mostly because I had sort of an epiphany earlier today. Basically, I was in the bathroom at DU today and it hit me, I feel like I'm going around and around in cirlces. No matter what I have been doing recently, no matter what choice I make or where I chose to turn I feel like I keep going around the same spot. If you remember the old cartoons where the guy gets on an exit ramp for a highway and then gets off trying to get where he's going, only to keep getting on and off in the same area and not going anywhere only getting more angry that's basically how I feel right now. 

After this epiphany of sorts I've felt really scared. Well, I've felt very scared and turned around, just like the lyric says, for quite awhile now but it just hit me today. It hit me in such a way that I've been having manic anger moments that have my head feeling like it's about to explode.

I could really use somebody right now, but that doesn't look like it's in the cards right now or anytime soon.

Later for now.
