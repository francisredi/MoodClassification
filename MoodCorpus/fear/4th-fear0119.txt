transitioning....
So...Annick read my tarot today.  I always do it for other people, and I'm good at it.  Not to toot my own home, but I'm good at it.  But I never get it done to me, because I don't know many people who read tarot, or at least they're not here (Hi, darthparadox!)
But I kind of get the stunned silent reactions now.  It's weird when someone who's not you picks apart your life.  That's the best kind of reading, but it's also really scary.  It's like, I know what I need to do.  Now I just have to do it, but it's scary, and I'm kind of a coward.  Well, maybe not coward, but I'm not as out going as I want to be, and I'm not where I want to be in my life.  I'm scared, of a whole lot of things, and I need to not be scared anymore.
Here's the thing...I'm a solitary person, and for the most part it's by choice.  But sometimes, and more and more lately I've been worried.  I see that vision of myself, older and working, and alone, and it doesn't have the same appeal it used to have.  I don't think I like that anymore.  But now I have to change everything.  Well, not everything, but something.  I don't know.  Maybe I'll be more eloquent later, but I've become so used to putting myslef in this one role, and I'm afraid that I won't ever be able to break out of it.  I'm not asking for anything, but there it is.  
I don't know.  I guess getting my tarot freaked me out a little more than I thought it would.
