The sickies again
Metformin can rarely cause a serious condition called lactic acidosis, which can be fatal. Seek immediate medical attention if you develop any of the following symptoms of lactic acidosis: unusual tiredness (fatigue) or severe drowsiness, cold skin, muscle pain, breathing trouble or rapid breathing, unusually slow or irregular heartbeat.

After reeding that and asking Foxxie for her opinion I made a doctors appointment. My symptoms? unusual tiredness, cold skin, and muscle pain. Other symptoms are severe headaches. I am not going to tell dad about this appointment simply cause I am don't want to be belittled for feeling badly.

I exprinces moments of shakes as well, I am being to get rather scared, and its worst at work. I think its because they (my co-workers) are like my dad in many aspects. So that adds another stress level onto everything else.

Anyways I will try to post the results of the appointment if I remember to do so
