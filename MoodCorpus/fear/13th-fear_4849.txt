the past is in the past
When I Die!! Torn to pieces Clawed to death Broken home Broken heart Nothing is safe No one is right Don't tell me the pain passes It only grows worse From a dot to the world to a universe It never stops Everyone knows nothing of me I wear a mask Concealing my true feelings Whether happy or sad&nbsp;All they see is me smiling, Then alone I cry myself dry Nothing's worth living for I hope life will be better WHEN I DIE!! Psychosomatic Suicide wasted down below darkness calling hello to you shadowy figures and bright lights lead you through the dreary night you see him coming you know he's there but you'll always wonder where figures you arn't aware sneak around, knowing no fear daytime passes slowly now and night is no better watch the clock and see the hands stomach churns with "unkept" fright can you even sleep tonight? Roams the next day and starts again you'll get him soon enough with ease your pain and torture can't get worse he'll die someday to end this verse I wrote these a few years ago. They arn't that good, but I was really going through a rough time. I felt that if I wrote it down it would go away. All the times that I cried and wanted to be somewhere else completely, wanted to change what had happened, done something different. Anything. &nbsp;But they didn't, those feelings never went away completely. Reading them now brings really bad memories. I've made many&nbsp;mistakes. Non of which I can take back. They make me cry every time, every time.&nbsp;I know now that I have come further away from that point. But I can't believe that I was there. It scares me. What happens if I go back to that point? I can't go back to that point. I don't want to go back to that point.&nbsp; I will NOT go back to that point. &lt;---sounds like I'm trying to convice myself, which it also scary.
