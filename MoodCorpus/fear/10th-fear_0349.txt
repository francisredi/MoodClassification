Help me, please!
Does anybody read this?  If you read this, I'm reaching out to you cuz I really need help.  I just did something I know I shouldn't have done.  There's something really wrong with me here.  I don't know what I can do.  I don't have an apointment with my therapist until a week from Thursday.  I think I need to speak with someone sooner.  I'm going crazy here.  I know the way I live, I'm gonna end up killing myself long before my time.  I'm not even trying to hurt myself anymore.  I do things without realizing I'm doing them.  I want to love myself.  I want to take better care of myself.  For the love of God, help me!  I'm really scared.  It only takes one little thing to send me spiraling.  I need help.  I need a push in the right direction.  Hell, I need someone to hold my hand through this.  I don't care whether or not I am romantically involved with you.  Shit, it would probably be better if we weren't.  I am not as independent as everyone likes to think.  I'm not accountable for my actions at all.  Now I'm really scared.  I feel as though I really have nothing now to fall back on.  Help me please!  I want to stop hurting myself.  I'm through with it.  But I can't stop.  I don't know what's wrong with me.  There's something inside of me that wants the pain to go away, something that wants me to take the initiative and stop it.  But there's a voice inside of me that's tearing me down.  Sometimes I wonder if it is the real me.  But I know it's not.  It can't be the real me.  I won't let it.  Somewhere inside there's a strong person struggling to get out.  I need you, whoever reads this.  I need you to help me through this.  Please.
