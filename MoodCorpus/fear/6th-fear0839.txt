Oh this has been an interesting day
God. 4th update of the day. So the guy I gave my screen name to, Jeff? Well I was talking to him for about 2 hours tonight and I guess I'm hanging out with him tomorrow. I don't know what I've gotten myself into. It's not going to be good times I can tell you this right now. I know I'm going to come up with some lame ass excuse and get myself out of it. I always do. But this time, he's in my U.S History class. So I can't avoid him. I know what you're probably thinking. I haven't been in a relationship in a while and I need to stop blaming myself for what happened with Vinny. I just... I don't know. I'm afraid of commitment. I hate the fact that I'm a virgin. I hate that I'm afraid of intamincy, getting close to someone, sexual or not. I'm afraid that they'll do what Vinny did. It can't be healthy having your first relationship last for so long and be so shitty. I think a large part of it is that things move way to fast for me in college. And it doesn't help that I'm uncomfortable in my body. Blarg. I guess we'll see how it goes.
