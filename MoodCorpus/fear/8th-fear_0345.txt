I curse my protoboard
I've not yet completed soldering the stupid protoboard and already I hate it. I think I damaged some of the wires when I soldered it. I worry it will not work when I test the future projects. My professor scared me when he spoke of how students spent hours and hours fixing their codes when in fact, the board was the cupid. He spoke of how students failed the course because their boards didn't work.

I'm worried. I'm worried. I'm worried. I hate myself. Why did I solder it so badly? God, I hope the board isn't damaged. How do I undo it? I want to get another prototyping board, but somehow I couldn't access http://www.zarx.info/. I've gotten tangled in this web. How do I get out?

I've not worked on the naruto_rabu assignment. Shit. I have only 2 more weekends. I'll try to work on it, but I'm afraid my maddening worriment will affect the quality.

I'm scared. I'm deadly scared. I don't want to unsolder the board because I may damage it furthur. What must I do? If I fail the course, I don't know what I must do. The future is bleak. I think a second major is in order. I need a back door out. I should take Chem & Phys in the next semester. Who cares if I graduate in 2009? Damn it. I'm scared. I'm so useless. I must be the most useless person in the world.
