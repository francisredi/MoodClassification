I feel so sick
I know that God has a plan for all of us and that no matter what it is there is a reason for everything that we go through in life, even if we can't see why or what the good it does us. I just want to know why it all has to be so painful and why I can't stop feeling so sick. I want to eat food but I cannot. Is it selfish of me to want my pain to go away? We just watched Passion of the Christ tonight and thinking about it, he went through so much and yet I can't deal with the small about of pain that I have by comparison. Is it selfish to call on God and say I give it all to you and can you take my pain away? Is it? I am so lost right now, as to what I should be doing with my life. Everything is being thrown at me at once and I am having problems cooping, but should I? So many people have it worse off than me but I still complain. Everything seems like my fault no matter what anyone says or it seems like this pain won't go away. And yet everyone seems to love to tell me that it will be okay. If it is going to be okay then why do I keep wigging out? I want to retch every 5 minutes and the pain in my stomach won't settle down, but I have become to see myself as a total prat for being such a burden to everyone. And no matter how hard I try I really feel so alone even though I know I shouldn't. I call out to God and I know that he listens, but I feel so unworthy of His love and everyone else's. I pretty much feel like shit and wish it would end.
