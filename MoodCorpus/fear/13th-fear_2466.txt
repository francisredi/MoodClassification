The days are long and stressful. I feel like bursting into tears at random moments. My schedule next semester won't allow me Fridays off which makes me sad. My schedule for next semester sucks. I got lucky this year though.   

This place drains the life out of me day by day. I wish I had someone to hold me here. It might make all the difference. It is so lonely here. I have friends. But it's not the same as home. I can't relate about my life. And I don't have a life here to relate about except the stress. My social life consists of eating at the cafe with friends.

It also occurred to me that I don't know any fashion majors who are happy here. We are all miserable. I wonder if it's the program here or if it's this way in other schools as well. I hope this is not the fashion life. I don't think it is, I know it's stressful, but it can't possibly be this miserable.

It would be nice to be happy about being here. To look forward to returning after a weekend. This never is. One more year of misery and I'm done with this place forever. I hope the misery I am putting myself through is worth it.
