To the doctor we go
Off to my pain specialist this morning, in the neighbouring city of Guelph (that's pronounced Gwelf, for those not in the know).  He's a good guy, Punjabi in origin, and knows his crap about pain.

I'm hoping that I can get him to write me an exemption for the Joylent Green.  I'm also going to consult with him about the narcotic regime I'm on from my GP - I wasn't taking any pain meds the last time I went to him.  He'll very likely decide he'll go back to the epidural steroid and an array of nerve blocks.  I get the one - the epidural - in the base of my spine.  It's one of the least fun things I've ever done - it feels as though this large man is doing a one-handed handstand on my S-I joint - and crushing it with the one hand, while he's doing the handstand.  I.e., it HURTS.  He's a hell of a pain-inflicter, as well as a pain-fixer.  Anyway, after the epidural, he does about twenty needles into the shoulders and neck, 10 each side.  Because that's so awful, he tends to do it as quickly as he can, so his technique on any given shot is...call it brutal, if you will.  I do appreciate him doing it fast, though, as doing it slowly and carefully probably wouldn't make it much less painful.  

When I get this treatment, it usually leaves me wrecked for the day, but it also gives me some relief for a week or so.

So that's my morning.  My Beloved is driving me, in case he does decide to do a treatment today, though I think it unlikely.  I haven't been to him in a little over a year, and so I think he'll probably just be doing the consult this morning.  Be back by...oh, 11:30 or so, I'd guess.
