and the devil's always trying to make you scared of the absence of sound
and the devil's always looking for a way to convince you that yer a nothing
and the devil's always trying to put a new song in your head to sing"

anyway, that's just the course.  tell me wut you think it means if you want, i always think it's fun to see wut people think yer talking about.  but yeah.  same old depression again, i almost burst into tears quite a few times these past couple days.  i think it's getting worse, and i'm not helping out much.  i feel like i keep fueling it, but it's just... well it's hard to explain.  if i don't fuel it then it hurts more, but in the end i think it lasts longer if i do keep feeding it... but it just hurts so much, you know?  i mean there are things that help me but i can't really supply those things... i'm really hoping that Spirit West Coast will fix things up, though i'm worried becuz all my friends that are going hang out with these other people that i don't know and when i try to make friends with them they just kinda ignore me... so i'm kinda scared that i'll be all alone... i've kinda been feeling that way alot, like alot of my friends (not all of them) are kinda ignoring me and all and so i'm trying to fix things with them and it's just do chaotic... i feel like crying.  i'm scared about alot of things and i hate feeling this way and i dunno.  depressed.  alright, i'm gonna leave.  peace out
