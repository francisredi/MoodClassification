Fear
I fear the woods behind my house.  I dunno if I have a reason to be scared or not.  Anyway, I was in the kitchen making tea and Chris was outside barking.  He always barks but for some reason something made me open the door and listen and I heard walking sounds in the woods.  I know that guy was spotted twice in our neighbordhood a few weeks ago and I do think about it a lot.  So when I heard sounds coming from the woods and my dog barking the first thing that comes to my mind is that it's a human rather than an animal.  But seriously what are the chances of that?  I want to tell myself it was just an animal that you heard walking but my mind thinks the opposite.  So I dunno after listening a little I got nervous about Chris cos he got quiet so I went outside and called him inside.  I let him in the house and then I just leaned over the railing on the deck listening for more sounds and looking into the darkness.  The sounds seemed to disappear and then my mom saw me outside and came out and I told her that I thought I heard someone so we both stayed out there listening and then went inside.  When I was young I never feared the woods. I'd play in them all the time and now I won't even go near them.  That's the problem with growing up.  We are so much more cautious and it just ruins your mood and how you perceive everything.  I don't even feel comfortable being home alone anymore and that shouldn't happen *sigh*. I think a lot of it has to do with what we see and hear from the media.
