There's one thing I can do nothing about..
Well, it's not going to be tonight. I'm hoping it'll be tomorrow. I don't know. I guess that's all I can do. But he's gonna have to let me call him, because I'll possibly be at my grandmothers. It makes me literally sick because I'm nervous. Every single song remidns me of him. I can barely stand just sitting around because thinking of it hurts too much. I love him with everything inside of me, and I just want things to work out. i have never felt like this about anyone before, even though you may hear it a lot from people. I have never been more serious than I am right now. I have never meant anything more than this. I have never loved anyone more than this. I just hope he hasn't lost all feeling. I have experienced once breakup in my life that meant something. This is 20 times worse. I know this because last time was a completely different thing. I wanted what I was used to. I wanted someone to "love" me. I wanted someone who would "care" about me. I want this because I'm in love. I want this because he makes me happy, and I know I can make him happy. I want this because I know things can be different. I want this because being without him hurts. 
I'm not suicidal, nor am I emo. It's called heart broken. so get used to it. Too bad, if you don't like it, don't read it.
