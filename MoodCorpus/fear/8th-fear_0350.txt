a little nervous
Today's show went good as well. I had meant to go to my mathclass afterwards even though we were given a day off, because I really cannot afford to get behind on anything at the moment. But I just felt so tired when I was at my friend's house that I decided to skip it for once... I feel bad about it now but I really needed the rest. We had two hours of dance after that and I am quite tired right now. Just drank two mugs of coffee but I can't feel it working yet.

Tomorrow's going to be a tough day. First two hours of tomorrow's classes are a test-exam in History (we have a real final next week and this week we are making one to test our knowledge) The next two hours we have our listeningexam in French. I am a little (read: a lot) worried about it... I hate listeningtest, and English is ok as I can understand that quite easily... But the danger with French is that it can be totally incomprehendable at some points. It's a beautiful language but I have often experienced during listeningtest practices that somewhere during the tests you somehow seem to lose your ability to listen. You just dream off and before you no it the darn cd says 'beep' and you've totally missed the answer.

The good thing about it is that we can resit it, but I hope that I can do it right in one time.... Listeningtests are hell and I really do not want to sit through another two hours of intensive listening to a French person rambling on and on about some very uninteresting job or political item.
