I got stopped at a check stop today and it was so incredibly scary. Even though they searched my car and only found a box of tampons and my english homework, I was speeding and didn't have a taillight so I definitly had two police officers in my window shinning a light at me yelling at me that I was irresponsible and I almost killed one of them and they don't think i'm worthy of driving and basically in so many words telling me I was the scum of the earth, at least that was what I felt like once they finished verbally attacking me. I never had anything against police officers, but I definitly do now. I am a teenage girl driving 14 kilometers over the speed limit with no tail light not some criminal mastermind out to foil the police force, god by the time they were done with me I was balling and they told me I better get out of their way and a slow speed too...SO SCARED! I am over it now, but holy shit was i scared, I was shaking so badly...I just wanted to be like "stop yelling I get it, i'm horrible I get it just please stop yelling at me!!!" at first I was very scared but now i'm more like really angry. Only because when it's a police officer you can't really defend yourself, you just have to sit there and listen and if he starts to get cruel you can't really tell anybody cause hey it's the law, but basically I wanted to die right then. Thank god there were no drugs in my car or booze, I think I would have shot myself, it would have been better then hearing someone tell me what a waste of space I am.
