Well that was a week I never want to live through again. 

On Thursday it was announced in work that there's going to be some redundancies. Basically, we lost a major account in November, although it only took effect on 1 January. We'll have a preliminary list of jobs at risk on Tuesday, and a final list on Valentine's day. As the bf and I work for the same company we're shitting ourselves, especially as they probably won't take personal circumstanes into account when making the selection.

They're asking if anyone would take voluntary redundancy, but the package is so laughable that it's unlikely many people (if any) will go for it.

On Thursday I was upset, by yesterday I was angry. They've had 2 months to prepare for the loss of the account and they've done nothing, despite them claiming at the time that they'd do all they could to avoid letting people go. Also, I don't think they can really tell how the loss of the account will affect the business after only 4 weeks.

I'm so scared.
