Evicted!
They've finally come for Tony B.He decided he was going to "wait and see what they do".&nbsp; They decided to plaster a large pink eviction notice on his front door.Now he has all of 10 days to figure out what to do with a three bedrooms full of stuff that belonged to his deceased grandmother.&nbsp; The contents of a family home.&nbsp; Mementos, furniture, heirlooms....&nbsp; Everything, even the bag from the funeral home with the flyers from her funeral.&nbsp; His grandmother apparently collected little figurines and statues.&nbsp; It broke my heart to hear him talking about how he's "going to smash everything" so "they won't get anything".&nbsp; I beseeched him to at least box the things up for Goodwill, but all he said was that I could buy it if I wanted to.He's quite confident that he'll be okay.&nbsp; He's "not worried about finding a place to live".&nbsp; Apparently, he has no wish to preserve the mementos of his family.&nbsp; He wants to have a big party, trash the place, and I guess wait and see what happens again.&nbsp; He's got the money to straighten the situation out, but he tells me he needs to "leave the nest".It all makes me feel terrible.&nbsp; I'm taking custody of his fish.&nbsp; That, at least, he seems to care about.I hope he manages to get things straightened out.&nbsp; I think he's a little bit crazy right now.&nbsp; I hate to see someone's family home callously and casually destroyed just because people figure "that's the way things are going to be".&nbsp; I've seen it happen too many times already.I hate what the world has become.&nbsp; Why can't good things be the norm, rather than awful, tragic things?Oh well.&nbsp; Nothing in my power that I can do.&nbsp; :(
