(Not such) comfort food
You can often tell how much your dietary habits are improving by how sick it makes you to go back.  Yesterday, don't ask me why, I bought a dozen M&M cookies at the grocery store across the street, and half gallon of chocolate milk.  I think I figured that I needed a little comfort food and I hadn't indulged in this sortof thing in quite a while, so it would be okay, just this once.
 
It was a major mistake.  I feel stressed, depressed, and isolated enough from the move and from the job hunt, and now the crash from the sugar high has amplified that by about a hundred times.  I don't feel physically ill, but emotionally, I feel like complete shit.  I feel somehow lost, abandoned, hopeless, and alone, and all for no good reason.  
 
I'm cooking some brown rice, now, and am getting some corn and a good sized pork chop ready for when that's done.  I'll have to hit the treadmill after dinner to work up some positive energy, too.  No more comfort food for me.  I've learned my lesson.  Somehow, I really do feel hopeless.
 
I know there's no reason to feel like this, but I'd forgotten how real it can feel.  :(
