Thoughts on valentiMes day
If you know me, you know I love holidays. I most especially love ones I can make a big deal of, and do stuff that is not expected. So Valentines Day is ideal. I bake cookies, buy gifts/candy, send things, buy and create my own cards. Course friends are the best for this, I think better than that 'special someone' that I am becoming so sick of hearing about. I wrap things, I go through ungodly amounts of red white and pink sprinkles and red food dye. Yet, the day before I get depressed about it. I before have blamed this on those I was with for most did not want to celebrate it making it either forced or more commonly didn't a non-occurrence. But now, even if its a 'delayed valentines day' I'm just sad. I mean, I don't want to expect anything, and don't think I do to avoid getting my hopes up, but at the same time I really don't. I think I'm just rambling... I guess I don't even know if I want someone to do something for me, I think I'd just be embaressed. Actually I think the thing that would mean the most to me was something, a card, from my dad, or a phonecall from Mom. Mom always loves valentines day, I even have a present from her waiting on my counter to be opened tomorrow. Now because I have a Doctors appointment to discuss blood work, and Research Methods Test tomorrow, I don't think I should be here delaying studying any longer, nor do I have any reason to be looking forward to tomorrow. Won't even get a chance to see any of my friends... :(
