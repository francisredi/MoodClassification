life
My best friend is not pregnate.... She didn't loose the baby. Aparently life can played a sick and twisted joke on her. two doctors and two pregnancy test told her that she was definatly 99.9 % sure of being pregnate. And I got exited and she got exited and turned her life in side out to prepair for the coming baby. Part of this was moving to Al to be near her mom. when she got there she went to the crisis pregnancy center for a check up. They gave her a test and it said that she wasn't pregnate. she showed them the other two. They sent her to a gino doctor who did thorough exam including a ultrasound. He said she didn't have a baby in her, had never had a baby in her and that it is all in her head and that she has to much estragin. Doctor said she probably had to much estragen because of stress. so that is all sad she is sad and in AL and I am sad and in fl. 
I am mad because there is no one to blame this is just something that hapens to somew people. But it still isn't fair. we wanted her to be pregnate. we both long for the day we get to hold a baby in our arms and not have to give it back to its mom. because are the mom. And here life goes and plays this sick joke on her. I am so scarred that tha may happen to me. Iam scarred of lossing a baby. I am scared of never being able to have babies. 
I am sad for Pam but also for me because I would have been there. It would have been my niece or nefue. But now it just isn't and aparently never was.
