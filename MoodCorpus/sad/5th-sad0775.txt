Hm...
I feel like a part of me is dying here in Appleton.  Perhaps it's because I'm a creature of habit and I had gotten use to the routine I had going in Madison.  Or maybe it's because I'm a stupid girl and am depressed that I haven't been able to talk to Andy for more than a week.  I miss him so much.  Even cartoon versions of him drawn in Yourmometer make me sad...God, I'm an idiot.  I shouldn't be stupid and depressed about things I have no control over.  This shit happens and there's nothing I can do about it, so there's no reason I should be so sad, right?  Why am I even trying to convince myself?  It's not going to do me any good.  I can't listen to my own advice ever, or so it seems.  I'm going to go through another week, feeling as if part of me is missing.  I'm such a stupid girl.  At this point, I think it would be better if I didn't have any emotion what-so-ever.

I suppose on the upside I learned how to cook something new this weekend.  I'm really happy my parents like to cook so much and that they're so willing to let me help out and teach me what to do.  Some of the recipies in my family go by feel, and it certainly helps to have the experience that they have around when I'm attempting such things.  I can't wait to make my own potato dumplings when I'm on my own.  My family has such a mix of different traditions and foods and I'm glad to have the opportunity to experience them all.

This entire time, I still haven't stopped thinking about him...when am I going to stop?
