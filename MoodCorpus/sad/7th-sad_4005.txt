It'll be a day like this one when the world caves in
Today was pretty eventful.

I didn't end up going to the funeral with my mom cuz I had to babysit last minute.  Well the mom tells me that Michael had been throwing up last night.  (Great, I know I wanna sit for a puking sick kid).  Ugh, I've already gotten sick from those kids twice.  Luckily he slept most of the time.  Around 2:30 he woke up & was crying, asking for his mom.  Well, she was also at a funeral so she had her cell phone off.  I didn't know what to do.  She was supposed to be home at 3, but by the time 4:12 came around, I was thinking otherwise.  Finally she came home and fortunately Michael didn't puke.  I don't know what I would've done if he did cuz throw up just grosses me out so bad.  I'm fine w/ bugs, blood, idk anything else, but puke, I just can't handle.  I was saying Our Fathers in my head that he would keep the kid healthy and not let him throw up while I was there.

Then I go home to get horrible news from my uncle.  I'm not even gonna start about that cuz I'll just start crying all over again.  It's so ironic: whenever I think my life is going pretty good it's like I just get kicked in the stomach.  Why can't I just have a few happy weeks before something else goes wrong?  Yesterday was a great day cuz my mom's bosses are paying her money they owe & all this great stuff happened.  Yet that happiness couldn't last for more than 1 day?  I hate this.  And I've been so happy about DR and LBI and now my life is turning upside down.  My family has enough problems as it is, yet here we are, struck with another one.  I just don't even know what to do at this point.  I want to talk to someone, yet I don't wanna cry any more.  But I kinda do just wanna sit and cry for hours and let it all out...or just scream.  I don't know.  I definitely don't wanna go to school monday.  I'm so upset I have a stomachache and my hands are shaking.  This is stupid.
