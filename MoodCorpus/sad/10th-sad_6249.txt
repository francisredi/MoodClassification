so maybe it is just me...
so maybe it is just me.. things do keep getting worse. im stupid for thinkin different. i dont think me and my boyfriend will ever get along. he stood here tonite tried to defend sum girl over me. im just not havin it. thats the past, i took her boyfriend away in 8th grade, and he was the one who wanted to be with me. its not only my fault. yah, i was "that" girl who took her man, but now she is with him, and hatin on me! i think thats stupid. i guess it is just an immaturity thing.. i dont kno and dont care. but i dont really care if she likes me anywaiz. but when he straight out told me that "he will defend them".. i think that is just fuckd up. i dont really care who likes me or not, but dont defend some bitch before me.. its just getting worse. i know that i love him and i know that he cares for me, but all the other things  are just too much. it hurts me and  he doesnt understand. i dont want him to not have friends, just because certain girls dont like me at his skool, but damn.. defendin a girl before me, that is just wrong.. i honestly wonder how he would feel if it was the other way around. this just sucks, and he dont understand...
