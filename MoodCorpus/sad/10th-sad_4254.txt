Katharina slid up to the bar after she got off work, feeling very sorry for herself. As she straddled the nearest barstool, Katharina sighed to herself as she saw a few quiet people sitting at the opposite end of the table. Only the lonely... she sang in her head. Work had been fine, a fairly normal day at PPTH, as things went. But Katharina's mood slipped lower and lower as she continued to see truck after truck full of flowers deliver their wares to people at the hospital. I hate Valentine's Day, she thought to herself as she ordered a double shot of Jack Daniels from the bartender.

Someone started "Dancing in the Dark" on the jukebox and Katharina smiled for the first time all day. Then her smile turned to a frown as tears welled up in her eyes. An image flashed in her mind: Katharina as a small girl, dancing next to a poster of Bruce Springsteen in her father's workshop. Her father smiled as he sang along with The Boss, "Who are you gonna marry, honey?" He asked her, "You, Daddy. But if I don't marry you, I'll marry Mr. Bruce. And we'll live across the street," she replied. Katharina's father swung his daughter around, laughing as they danced.

Katharina shook herself out of her daze and slammed her third or fourth shot, she couldn't remember which. She ordered another and lay her head down on the cool bar top, trying to not feel so alone.
