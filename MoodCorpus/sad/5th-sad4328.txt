My parents and I went to church this morning.  The sermon was on MLK day, of course.  I've heard better MLK sermons, but this one was actually preached by a black man.  My dad thought the sermon was good; I thought the sermon was crazily repetitive.  Dad pulled out some seminary term to describe the sermon's style.  Whatever.  After church, we went to The Corner Bakery for lunch, which was okay but it was  no Panera.  And after that...well, my parents went home.  I always miss them so much when they leave, and I'm never sure exactly why.  It seems like I get more and more homesick the longer I've been in college.  And I don't know anyone on my hall, and they all know each other, and so it's weird.  And I have my door open, and no one is stopping by to say hi...singles are lonely.

I went to Suburban Square with Christin and Christine today after my parents left.  I thought it would ease the pain, but it didn't.  I've just been feeling oddly depressed all day, because everything feels so out of place.  This is the first time that I can't go visit Anjali--that's WEIRD.  Maybe things will feel better once classes start, but I'm starting to doubt it.  I miss Alex, I miss Amanda, I miss Anjali, and I miss my family.  Meh.  This will go away--it has happened before and it always goes away--but for now I'm really feeling terrible.
