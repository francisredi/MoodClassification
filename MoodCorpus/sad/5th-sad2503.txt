why can't i luv myself for being a stupid emotional girl?
so right now, i'm hating myself. feeling sorry for myself, hating myself for feeling sorry for myself. i told myself i wouldn't do this anymore. i guess i'm human. i just hate who i am sometimes. and it's like i cant get over msyelf. and then i just do it to myself more and more. and i hate that it's just all about me. because that's all depression is. feeling sorry for urself. egocentric. whatever. its just retarded and i wish i would stop it. i dont feel like i'm growing or changing. i guess i need to trust. trust. trust. trust. i do all this to myself, so why can't i change? why can't i be who i should be. why can't i stop being scared of doing what i want to do? why can't i love myself? why can't i believe that i can do the things i see myself doing? why can't i believe that those things i see myself doing are from God? why can't i just open my eyes and ears more? why do i wish i could be someone else sometimes? why? God created me to be who i am. i can tell people this all the time, but i can't even listen to myself. why do i feel like i've almost fallen further than i ever have before? why cant i just stop being a stupid emotional girl? why can't i luv myself for being a stupid emotional girl? god does.......
