AEROSMITH - "I Don't Want To Miss A Thing"
I could stay awake just to hear you breathingWatch you smile while you are sleepingWhile you're far away dreamingI could spend my life in this sweet surrenderI could stay lost in this moment foreverEvery moment spent with you is a moment I treasureDon't want to close my eyesI don't want to fall asleepCause I'd miss you babyAnd I don't want to miss a thingCause even when I dream of youThe sweetest dream will never doI'd still miss you babyAnd I don't want to miss a thingLying close to you feeling your heart beatingAnd I'm wondering what you're dreamingWondering if it's me you're seeingThen I kiss your eyesAnd thank God we're togetherI just want to stay with you in this moment foreverForever and everDon't want to close my eyesI don't want to fall asleepCause I'd miss you babyAnd I don't want to miss a thingCause even when I dream of youThe sweetest dream will never doI'd still miss you babyAnd I don't want to miss a thingI don't want to miss one smileI don't want to miss one kissI just want to be with youRight here with you, just like thisI just want to hold you closeFeel your heart so close to mineAnd just stay here in this momentFor all the rest of timeDon't want to close my eyesI don't want to fall asleepCause I'd miss you babyAnd I don't want to miss a thingCause even when I dream of youThe sweetest dream will never doI'd still miss you babyAnd I don't want to miss a thingDon't want to close my eyesI don't want to fall asleepI don't want to miss a thing
This came on at work tonight and i almost cried right infront of Chelsea on front line. :'( It sucked so bad.
