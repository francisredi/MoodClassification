I should just throw in the towel
God, this shit fucking sucks ass. I mean my love life is such a failed cause whats the point. I mean nobody shows interest, and if they do its not sincere. I just get used for some ulterior motive and tossed away once my role is finished, then the others involved go about happy fucking lives. I'm tired of failure, of all the work put into nothing. My soul is so weathered by the continuous rejection all that is left is a feeling of emptiness. I try to seem nice, I don't feel it thought. I see all these people and it pisses me off. Their lies and fake actions, I see through them and I watch people get hurt. Yet they are still worthy of another's love? I fucking sick of the hurt coming to me for condolence just to be disregarded whist they continue down the same path to pain. But at least they get to feel that pain and I envy them. They'll love, be loved, then they will feel pain. I feel an emptiness deep inside that only get worse with time. It aches every waking hour of the day. Am I really that worthless? What is it that determines who is worthy of love and who is destined to fall into the clenches of the cold blackness that is my loneliness?
