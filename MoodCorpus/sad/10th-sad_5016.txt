Ho Hum...
*Sighs* Not much to say right now.  I was going to update, but I'm in no mood at the moment.  I'm in kind of a funk right now.  I go through these once in a while, but this one seems...different, somehow.  I think that with school and such, I've been suppressing the loneliness, and now it's coming out.  It's not just that everyone seems to be in a relationship with someone, I just feel, well, alone.  I dunno.  What I do know is that I crave a strong relationship right now.  The funk has kinda been coming and going for a couple of weeks, but it's now in full force.  I don't think anyone has noticed, though, because I've been hiding these emotions from everyone, including myself.  I don't know why i'm doing this.  It's a damn facade and I should stop.  But for some reason, I don't want people to know how I feel.  I dunno.  I just know that i'm really depressed right now and that maybe I should let someone in for once in my life.  What I want is a relationship.  I see all of these happy people in great relationships.  On the one hand, I'm happy because my friends are happy.  On the other hand, it makes me feel left out.  Right now, I just don't know what to do.  I'm sick of people saying that someone will come along for me.  I'm fucking sick of the waiting.  I've done my time, now when do I get my turn?  I'm sick of living in this big house by myself.  I know I have friends that care a great deal about me, but sometimes it seems like I don't.  I dunno.  Maybe these 'ol blues will pass.  I hope so. :(
