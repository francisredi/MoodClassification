I'm going through the worst time of my life right now.  My grandpa is dying... dying a horrible and painful death.  He had congestive heart failure like 2 weeks ago and has been in the hospital since.  He developed pneumonia and all sorts of other problems and he kept getting worse and worse.  He is 90 years old, so once he got sick it all fell apart fast.  He got fed up with the hospital and in his words "wants to die at home."  

So we got him home and now hospice is coming in and out to check on him and care for him, and all 5 of his children (my mom and aunts/uncles) are staying with him over night on rotation.  It is the worst situation.  I've already lost him, he looks pitiful in his bed, oxygen on his face and tubes coming off of him.  He isn't funny, he barely talks, has no energy to even stand up.  It feels wrong to say out loud, but I can't help but pray for him to die now.  He is suffering so much.  

But at the same time I don't want him to die.  I need him in my life.  His house, the house he built and has lived in for what seems like forever is going to be empty.  What is going to happen to it?  Where will my large family congregate after church on Sundays or for our dorky summer family barbecues?  My family means so much to me and I feel like with his death I am going to lose that last link to my childhood.  My heart is breaking now, and I've been crying my eyes out for days.  I feel kinda bratty because most people my age lose or have lost their grandparents, but I feel like I'm losing a parent.  I love him so much and this hurts more than I ever thought possible.  I know he wants to be with my grandmother in heaven, and I can't help but be slightly angry with God for not hurrying up and doing it already.  All of this prolonged agony is only making it harder on the family and on my grandpa.  I never thought I could feel this much pain.
