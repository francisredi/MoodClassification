I am not dead yet
Oh sorry Grace, I'll e-mail you the icon. Stupid livejournal being all bloody, "no, you can't put your image here, yadda yadda". Argh.&nbsp;



Oh holy cats, I am in it deep. I'm...I think I'm having a bit of a mental breakdown, which may not be news to some of you. I feel a little frazzled, and by a little, I mean severly utterly and totally.&nbsp;I didn't pass my socials project, which makes sense, but I wish it didn't. I need to find a recitation piece, because I still haven't done mine, I still haven't done that science test, or my band test, I still haven't even started my Macbeth questions, I think I've lost the sheets, I think my backpack is growing mold...this is due to me being too lazy to take out old lunches, my hair is falling out (this is not a joke, I keep pulling out huge clumps of hair) and god am I over weight.&nbsp;


I just yelled really loudly at my brother. My mom has to sleep in my bed tonight, oh how pleasent. I need to go talk to my teachers. All of them. Just tell them, that a) I am having a mental breakdown, b) I can't cope with the work load, and no extensions do nothing, c) I am moving to Albany, and I'm not coming back.&nbsp;


I might need to revise c.


Well, I am certainly not looking forward to talking to Mr. Robertson. Not at all.
