just fucking wonderful
foamy.. if and when you read this, please do not mention this to anyone.i was unloading the dishwasher, and i found this cool looking shard of glass. maybe if i had thought about it, i would have thrown it away. but no.. tanya's a fucking idiot. i go up to my room, and i get one of these depression washes. where the depression just seeps into every bone in my bone and i just want to curl up and die. well.. that's not a good feeling to have with a sharp shard of glass in your hand. i already had a cut on my leg from something, so i just kept scratching the skin around it with the glass. not hard enough to break the skin, but hard enough to raise the skin. as i'm doing this, i seek into deeper depression, and i scratch along my stomach. again, not hard enough to break skin, but hard enough to raise it. it's gone away on my stomach, but if you feel it, there's little raised lines. the ones on my leg are scarring. they look like cuts from a month ago. i feel like such a fucking idiot. why do i cut myself when i'm perfectly happy? can't i just enjoy the fact that i have awesome friends, a boyfriend who would do anything for me and vice versa, and somewhat okay parents? no.. i just have to look at the bad parts of my life and dwell on that. i don't want these scars. i don't want these thoughts. i just want it all to stop, but i am, by NO ways, committing suicide. i'll never cut hard enough to break skin. i hope i don't cut ever again, but i know i fucking will. damnit.. i always have to ruin e v e r y t h i n g.
