So, my father won't give me a straight answer about whether or not he's driving me down to South County tomorrow. Which is obnoxious, because if I have to take the bus, I'm going to get stranded at URI unless I can give Sara notice. He started getting pissed at me for not having a key to Sara's house, and I'm like "Why the hell would I have a key to her house? I don't live there." Whatever. I'm getting really depressed for no fucking reason.

My iPod is pretty. I'm being all stupid and ridiculous and not taking the thing out of the plastic sleeve that it comes in because I don't want any fingerprints or scratches on it. Whatever. I'm going to have to shell over another like $30 to get a case for it. Whatever.

I'm in a really really upset mood. It's stupid.

I think I'm just going to go lie down on my couch/bed and read until I fall asleep. Sounds familiar. Except that at Sara's, I'm with my friends. Here, I'm just being a stupid inconvenience to everyone in my house. 

P.S. I want a reliable cuddlebuddy, preferably one who is interested in pursuing a relationship with me, because I feel absurdly lonely right now. Just so you all know.
