sick of it all..
Lately i cant help but think about people. How people think, why they do the things they do? i feel like i'm alone... even though people tell me their here for me and they care as time goes on i feel like they drift farther and farther away... and what used to be isnt any more. for example... i have some firends that recently i just feel like they could honestly care less if i was around, i feel like i make such an effort to support them and never try to leave them out.  & in return i feel like i'm kicked to the cirb like i'm the back up when know ones around,i feel like with me when we're alone their one person and when others are around their someone totally different, they act like they've grown sick or me or just plain annoyed.. i dont no what i do to set this off i dont no if its actually even happening or its just in my brain? i tend to over think alot and people tell me things about myself that they i geuss dont like but to me i find keep me who i am? this confusses me... you think someone truely cares untill one day when a situtation happens and you see a totaly different side of someone, it just makes me wonder? do people not care about others feelings? especially the ones closest to them? i dont no i try to do my best to always let my friends no how much they meen to me i geuss i'm a little sensitve and sappy but i like that about me... i dont even no what i'm talking about any more so i'm goin to stop but the point i'm trying to make is not everyone is who they seem... and lately ive noticed it alot with people...
