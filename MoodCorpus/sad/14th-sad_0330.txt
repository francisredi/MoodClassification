"You're an absolute idiot."
Son't you hate it when at the worst times, the worst shit happens? Like, your own mother calling you a total disapointment and an absolutle idiot? Yea..That hurts. Oh, and dont you hate it when your trying pretty fucking hard and putting as much effort as you can into your school work and you end up getting shitty grades? AND THEN having your fucking mother rub it in your face how much of a fuck off you are?&nbsp;Well I fucking hate it.&nbsp;I havnt been "emo" in a long time and Im not trying to be, Im just TIRED of fucking up and being a failure. It really, really hurts to know that I, once again, have completley fucked up and theres not a adamn thing I can do about it. And Im tired of it. Im tired of putting effort into something thats not even worth it.&nbsp;Oh, and ONCE AGAIN..My mother, my own flesh and blood, didnt even tell me happy birthday yesterday, and she STILL hasnt.&nbsp;I hate my life right now, I really, really do. And I really really wanna cry, but Im gonna (wow this is gonna sound dorky..) be strong and im not GONNA cry. Im just gonna be a SPONGE and soak up everything and just...hide it all inside me. Like normal.
