Remembering
Today is the anniversary of my father's death.&nbsp; It's been 18 years.&nbsp; Most years I've had to remind myself of the date.&nbsp; The real mourning always happened on my birthday which I shared with my father.
This year I've been increasingly aware of it.&nbsp; Part of it is a response to my mother's visit a few months ago.&nbsp; Being with my mother is a jolt because she has 'changed' so much since my father's death.&nbsp; Many of the things that in recent years have been so difficult to deal with were behaviors I never saw in my mother until after my father died.&nbsp; It's hard to realize that much of what I knew of my mother was very much a reflection of my father and that she really wasn't so different from her siblings in many ways.&nbsp; 
The other part of it is a response to the growing understanding of my faith and the integration of my faith into my everyday life.&nbsp; My father was a model of faithful living for me.&nbsp; He very much lived his faith everyday - both in his private and in his public life.&nbsp; In some ways my life is vastly different from the life my father led.&nbsp; In other ways, it is very much the same.&nbsp; The priorities of faith, love and integrity and how those priorities were woven into your relationships - these are things I learned from my father - sometimes from what he said but more often from how he lived.&nbsp; 
I watched the Little Mermaid this afternoon with kitty and Christopher.&nbsp; Ariel's relationship with her father has some of the flavor of the relationship I had with my father.&nbsp; There was much we disagreed on but there was a tremendous amount of love in our relationshp.&nbsp; When I made decisions, my father's 'blessing' came not so much because he agreed with what I was doing but because he trusted that that values he had taught me, the values he had lived before me, were inside of me and would guide me.&nbsp; The moments of greatest sorrow since my father's death have been when I wished that he could see how what he taught me has been translated into my life.&nbsp;
