Update
I look in the mirror and think to myself what have I became, I'm worthless no ones ever going to want you, what's the point.I've been lied to my whole life. Thinking my parents actually loved me and supported me and my decisions. I guess that was one big fat lie, To actually believe them was stupid of me . All they care about is my older sister oh she's so perfect, No wonder I'm so messed up ,No wonder I starve and cut myself and take pills it's because of there lack of attention towards me , I'll never know why they don't support me and look at me the same way they look at my older sister. I'm the outcast of the family . It's seems whatever I do It's never ever good enough for them, or it's never good enough to compaired to what my sister has accomplished .Sometimes I just feel like running away realizing to myself if they would even notice or care that I'm gone, Sometimes I think to myself what it would be like to be adopted in to a perfect family .I think to myself I wouldn't have my ed . I hate who I've become . I have the lowest self esteem thanks to my parents they raised me to have all these problems , I blame them, My whole life has been shattered in to pieces . Everything I ever wanted has been taking away from me.I don't think I want to dream anymore. I hate every day ,It just seems to get worse and worse.I was visiting my sister, And she made me cry so many times by insulting me , And if I said anything back to her my parents would of yelled at me . So I just sat there crying. I sometimes think to myself why do parents outcast certain kids.It feels like I'm all alone .Anyways I think I'm just going to go to bed now take care sorry this is so long. I just had to get it off my head.
