Drugs and Alchohol
More and more am I beginning to see why people end up either drug addicts, alchoholics, or both. And more and more am I beginning to sympathize with them. However, I'll stay out of the drugs, but the alchohol on the other hand, will be a bit harder to do. So far its easy, when your don't have a dime to your name you don't have alchohol to your name either.

On another note, good think my mom keeps her gun locked up in a safe, God knows if I would be making this entry if it wasn't. "Oh God, just shut up already! If you kill yourself then record it live on the net so we can all watch and laugh." Although no one has said that to me, I've seen it said to other people. Personally, I'd love to track those people down and shoot their fucking dick off, or if they where girls, shot them in their fucking pussy. Am I bitter to heartless people? Maybe...

Of course I'm in one of those pissy and depressed moods. Looking at my life, I can't say I have much hope for it. My future appears to hold nothing but failure and pain. Wouldn't be so bad if I had a girlfriend. And not one of those "Oh my god, you are depressed, I'm dumping you" or "You don't have any money, I'm dumping you" types. I mean the "You're depressed, you're poor, but no matter what I'll stand by you because I love you." That shit is true love. Speaking of which, I'm beginning to think that love in that form simply does not exist.
