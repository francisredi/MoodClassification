sigh
I broke up with him. We didn't really talk or do anything anymore. Just little chats a day, barely anything. I talked more with friends than I did with him :( I hated that. And I know it wouldn't change..it's like that day after day lately (probably a couple weeks or so I can't really remember exactly but it's been a while). We had good days rarely where we would talk almost non-stop to each other but like I said that was rarely. We had feelings for each other but had little communication. I got depressed sometimes but I didn't say anything cause it wouldn't have made a difference, the only difference would be that we'd be depressed and not talking or doing anything. I wanted it to work but there was nothing I could do. We've had this problem before and it changed for a little while then it went back to the way it was. *sigh* I guess it just can't change. So I decided that breaking up was the only option left and I did. It hurts but I hated the way things were. I miss him. As much as I want to go crawling back I am going to hold back as much as I can. If I go back it won't change anything. I'm not going to stay in the relationship and just wait and wait and wait to see if it gets better. It was already getting depressing. We had been together for 2 years and a month and some days. I don't regret it. We had some good times but in the end it looks like it can't work. I don't know when it started going downhill but it did. This may hurt more but I'm just going to have to deal.

This song sounds quite beautiful but it sounds sad too. I don't remember what the lyrics mean.
