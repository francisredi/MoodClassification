Life...That's all I can muster
The bad thing about living far away is that when bad things happen, it is really really difficult to get there in time. And the simple fact is, well, you are not there. 
Apart from the fact the most unexpected thing happened to a wonderful person, I can't be there to say goodbye.
What the hell would it be like if you woke up one day feeling sick, only to discover a few weeks later you had terminal cancer? I mean, this person I have known is half of what he used to be, only conscious for ten minutes out of the day because he is so doped up from morphine. How can someone who is so full of life just all of a sudden lose all of it? Transform into a being caught between earth and the unknown? I don't understand all this SHIT. It makes me so fucking angry,I am just so...AHHHHHHH I can't even explain this drenched feelig I have. I am in this strange daze. Why the fuck am I out this far away. I can't miss important things like this, I need to go back. For as long as I can.
I have never experienced death, which is something I am really truly fortuante to disclose. I am so thankful for that. But this is so unfamiliar and it hurts in such an odd way. Granted, I don't know this man on really intimate terms, but he touched my life in a very large way and I always looked forward to his joyful red face. He was never lacking in compliments for me, he saw things in myself I still don't know exist. It is so lovely to hear someone tell you how beautiful you are on a regular basis, even if it is someone several years older. LOL. He is a special person. I hope things just...work out for the best.
Anyhow, I don't even know where I am right now.
