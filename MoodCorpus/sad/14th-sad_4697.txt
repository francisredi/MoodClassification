Just when I think I have the answers, I change the questions...
I'm going through another one of those stretches where I'm completely unhappy and depressed.  I wish I knew what the hell was wrong with me.  I went to see my grandmother yesterday and apparently she's doing fine to the point where she could come home in a few weeks, so it's not as bad as originally thought.  I was on pins and needles walking into that place because I read a News Journal expose not too long ago where these nursing homes really neglect and abuse older folks, so I was suspicious to say the least.  But the place my grandmother is at was nice and clean and the staff seemed friendly, so I was relieved by that.

Best of all, she remembered me, she knew who everybody was.  She asked me how school was going and all of that, and she pointed out that I was the only fool in the family who didn't have a jacket on.  Yeah, she's doing great.  

That should be enough reason for me to smile my ass off, but coming back down 13 yesterday afternoon, something just came over me, and I just was sad for the rest of the day.  I don't know what it is.  I mean I have these days where I'm bottom line down and out depressed.  I don't cry normally, but I was fighting back tears last night.  And I'm still trying to figure out why.  I'm starting to think that maybe I AM losing it.  I mean it's one thing to be alone, but it's another to let it cripple your entire day and demeanor. 

I can't be happy to save my life.  I mean there are things that are getting to me, like my grades and the fact that I'm gaining weight, but I'm just a mess right now.  I wish I knew what I could do to fix everything.  I guess I do need help after all.
