"geez louise, it's always something in this town."
so I went to my new dentist today...was fine until they decided to take x-ray's and found a cavity on a baby tooth I have.  (I have a baby tooth that never had a permanent tooth underneath it, weird I know.)  so the dentist was like, "well since you're here and I'm here and I have a little time let's go ahead and get that filled."  thing is, I never have cavities!  I've had 2 my entire life, I think.  so he gives me novacaine or whatever...and starts drilling and it starts hurting really bad so he gives me more novacaine.  it hurts the next time, so he gives me MORE novacaine.  so then I was paranoid it was going to continue hurting, but it didn't.  ugh, I was so glad to get out of there!  fuck the dentist!  then I had to do some errands and crap like pick up my sister and her friend and pick up my brother and go to walmart.  I went to the library and got a collection of lillian herman plays and cat on a hot tin roof.  as soon as I get those french scenes done (HOPEFULLY by the end of the weekend!  ideally, friday, but that's never going to happen) I'm going to start reading a TON of plays.  well maybe not a ton.  but a good amount.

le sigh.  bored bored bored is what I am.  I should be doing my french scenes...and I think I'm going to.  I'm not too swift with microsoft excel, but that's what I have to type them on.  ahhhhhhhhhhh okay so I'm bored typing this, I have nothing more to say.  goodbye.
