This is my journal
Have you ever wanted to be someone else so badly that it didn't matter what you did with your own life? That's how I feel. I'd give anything to live a certain other person's life, maybe when they were having it all and being beautiful in high school, maybe when they were beautiful in college, or famous or something stupid. Good lives are for beautiful people.

I'm dependent on my boyfriend. I'm insecure. My friends only give me pity calls, if they even call at all. "Oh no, Rachel's depressed. Better give her a call because she had to tell me she's depressed. Let's rip on her boyfriend because he's the only one that gives her attention, positive or negative." Five people told me in the span of four hours that they didn't remember my name. And all of them I have been introduced to within the past 24 hrs.. and no, they're no even all pledgese. I'm a worthless, forgettable piece of shit. 

Why don't I just hybernate in my bed for the rest of my life. I'm introverted. My "sisters" push me around and say mean thigns to me. I fight with my boyfriend constantly. I'm an unhappy person. I don't really know what I'm living for right now.
