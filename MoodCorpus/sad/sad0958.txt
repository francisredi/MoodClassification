Thinking...
So, I have been thinking about my past more and more lately, and i have come to the conclusion that i might not truly know who i am or what my purpose in this existence is supposed to be. I seem to start thinking about this every time i start to write. I may normally have a casual laid back attitude, but i find that i might just be lying to myself. perhaps i do truly care... behind all the masks i wear i find that i am just the same child that cried every time someone was mad at me, but what confuses me is that i couldn't even show those tears when i watched my brother died. I have never cried for him, but yet i can cry out of pity for myself. i used to believe that i could live without my masks, but now i do not think there is anyway that i could show anyone my true face. i can't remember when i started to cry constantly inside; but, more often then i would like my tears show up on the surface, and i tell the people that notice that my eyes are watering or my allergies are acting up. I suppose that it could be just out of pity for my own meager existence, kind of like me writing this here. There are really only two people that know me who would even read this; i feel like i am begging for pity, or perhaps trying to tell them to forget about me before they get too infected by this poor crying child. i sometimes consider putting a bullet in my head in order to stop the pain and the tears, but i'm not really worth wasting ammunition on and i wouldn't want to make someone have to clean up my useless brain matter. It is funny though, the only reason i can truly think of why not to do it anyways is because i'm really all that my mom has left... i don't think that she can survive losing another one of her children. It makes me wish i was adopted, so that it would not hurt her if i ceased to be. But, I guess even after all of this ranting I just pity myself even more. If reading this makes you cry for some reason don't, I Cry Enough For Myself All Ready.
