Valentines Day
Ugh...Valentines day. 
  The day where if you dont have anybody then it sucks! You walk down the halls and all you see are these HUGE stuffed animals, chocolate, and HUGE ballons, and what do you have?? nothing but candy from a friend. Oh joy.  RIght now Im hating Valentines Day!! Im thinking about my X-boyfriend Bryan and what we would be doing right now if I hadnt had made that stupid mistake of breaking up with him. Wondering if it could ever go back to the way things used to be. No more mistakes. 
         All the wonderful times together, talking till late hours of the night, telling him to put both hands on the wheel instead of holding my hand, hearing him ask if everythings ok, knowing that wherever you are that hes thinking about you too, trying to sneek in a kiss here and there, watching eachother with our middle schoolers thinking how lucky we are to have eachother, seeing him and thinking 'wow im so lucky to have a wonderful guy like him'.    Knowing now that that will probably not happen again anytime soon. Its these days that bring back all these memories, all the times you wish you could go back and relive again.  Then going back to the single moment when I wanted to take a break just to be safe and then it turning into us passing the halls and not even looking at eachother. 
       
      Now I look at him and I cant bear it. I feel so stupid to let him go like that, so stupid. Everyday I wake up with that feeling of regret and pity.  Right now Im listening to 'once a upon a december'


"Someone holds me safe and warm
Horses dance through a silver storm
Figures dancing gracefully
Across my memory
Things my heart used to know
Things it yearns to remember
And a song someone sings
Once upon a december"

I have no clue but that song always reminds me of him. Weird huh? Oh well I guess that I just need to move on with my life and still know in my heart that I still love him and that the memories that I had with him will always remain..
