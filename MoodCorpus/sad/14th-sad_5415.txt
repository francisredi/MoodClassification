So I'm in a nice big funk again...
Fairly common after this type of day, but it still sucks.  I didn't get to sleep until about 5am last night and got up at about 2:30pm, right before the new DnD game was to start.  The game was very cool.  Interesting start to a campaign and Jim does a good job DMing.  The general plot so far is that we're all circus freaks that were captured long ago when we were very young and kept in a dungeon to be shown off every few months.  The campaign starts with a strange golem appearing with a message from a wizard saying that he's marked us and needs our help, so he sent the golem to help us escape.  We proceed into a 5 hour session consisting of attempting to escape the dungeon.  Very well designed, if a bit on the harsh side.

Anyway, after the game, I fell asleep for another 2 hours on the couch.  So now it's nearing midnight, everybody's locked in their respective rooms, so it's dark, quiet, and lonely.  Good time for thinking, unless of course you don't want to think.  Thinking sessions very rarely lead to anything but depression for me, which leads to nothing seeming remotely interesting to do, which of course leads to more depression.  It's a wonderful little spiral.

Writing wakes me up a bit, so I won't go into what I was thinking about.  So now I try to see if I can find some food and something to do for a bit before time to sleep again.  Sometimes I really hate weekends...
