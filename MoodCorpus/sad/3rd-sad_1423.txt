I realized you were my undoing
I lied. It wasn't that Christmas repulsed me or that I hated it, because in fact quite the opposite is true. It was the fact that you weren't there, that you haven't been for years. I can't run around the Christmas tree lot to pick one out because it was our thing. I take no pleasure in opening gifts since you can't watch anymore. You ruined this holiday just like every other. You stole my innocence and childhood by not waking up. By saying it was my fault and wishing i was sick instead. Yet still I can't hate you even if I want to. I love you too much and I hate you even more for that. Even when I smile i feel guilty because you aren't able to. I don't want to feel anymore if feeling means dealing with this pain. The guilt hurts and it's eating at me. Should I feel guilty for living? Seeing as it was my fault you were sick. Your words are still imprinted into my very soul. You said you hated me, that I should be sick and not you for it was my fault. I want this all to go away. But I don't know how to make it.


I'm sorry I killed you. I'm sorry it wasn't me. I hope that makes it better.
