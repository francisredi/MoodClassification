Eh...
I really hate who I become when I am around my family for an extended period of time.  I hate that my thoughts become so bitchy and I am this sordid person when I am around them.  Meanwhile, I've been so fucking depressed to such a low that I feel I cannot do anything but lie around and watch the tele and complain about loneliness since I would have to drive at least 1 hour and a half in either direction until I hit a friend or a place with anything real to do.  My boyfriend being 2 and half hours, which fucking sucks.  But I really cannot connect with my family anymore.  In this heightened state of depression, I've been relishing so much in social connections and behaviors and since I'm so lonely, I can only ever see what's happening in my family or on t.v.  And since my family is so fucked up, it gives me a lot to feed on and become even further depressed about.  Ugh.  I can better notice my mom's habits, and my sister's habits, and all their exaggerations and how they deal with each other's habits and feed on each other and GAH!!  It's just so tiring!!  I hated thinking this way and seeing it all the fucking time which is why I moved to New York and got saved!!!  I reeeeeally hate what this place is doing to me--it feels like old times, and the old times sucked.  The old times were emo me, angsty me, angry me, rebellious me, bitchy, depressed, moody, cold, cynical me and anyone that has seen me in school or elsewhere will know that that is totally not me.  I can't stand this...Why can't 2 weeks be over already...?
