Miserable Days
I have no idea why, but lately I have been having many days where I was inexplicably sad, heartbroken, empty, withdrawn.  I worries me, maybe I am not managing my depression properally anymore or something.  But I take my meds, at pretty much the same time everyday, I take my vitamins, nothing happened to triggor this.......it scares me.  I don't want to go back to how I was, I don't want to go back to not knowing from one day to the next how I am going to feel and why.  I don't want to go back to simply waking up one morning and not be able to deal with life that day.  I can't go back to that, and I don't know how to stop.  Things are going so well for me right now, I have been having one of the best years of my life.......I need this to stop.

I hate to say this, but I think part of the problem is that I am lonely.  I want someone I can be truely intimate with, someone to love and who loves me back.  I am somewhat that way with Heather, which is why I have been having such a good year......but I long for that other type of intamacy and love, that intamacy and love I have only ever had with Olav.  LOL, I was watching an old Grey's tonight, and at one point Meredith says to Sheppard that she loves him so much that she hates him, that is how I think I will always feel about Olav.  It is no longer as passionate as it once was, but I do still miss him, hate him, love him, and I think I always will.  And that fact alone I both love and hate.  I think I just love and hate love :-P
