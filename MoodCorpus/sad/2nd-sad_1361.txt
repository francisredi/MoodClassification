I just...
realized what its like to feel pain from everywhere around you. People talk, people you never could imagine could talk without you. But they do. And when you find out, it really does hurt. Didn't expect what I read from a 'friend' earlier, but I guess I should have seen it coming. Whatever though. I was supposed to go to Alec's house later this week to see him. Was going to go with Bryan and Shea...might still...but I have to think about it. Bryan got friday off for it, and we might leave here around afternoon. Shea gets off of school around noon, cause of finals. But like i said, I have to think about whether I want to go or not. I fucking hate being sick. I have a cold, I feel almost betrayed. I feel lonely...but not for the reasons you may be thinking. Cause I have lots of people that want to talk to me, that call me everyday, that I go out with, and that love me, but I feel lonely, cause really, I don't care too much about these people. The people that I really care about besides Shea, are scattered around the nation. and its hard for me to give those people up, but I guess I have to sooner or later, as you find out that they aren't loyal to you. Whatever though. Going back to sleep, hopefully this time it will be longer.
