biggest loser
so i have come to the realisation that i have all these feelings and its driven me crazy for the past six months. also the realisation that i totally lost this. i totally said all these things, and assumed all this shit, and was driven mad with jealousy and had my heart broken and now im the biggest loser in this. its so depressing. just the little things, just the little internety things i force myself to see and hear. making these stupid connections because i have no real contact at all. it kills me. i have totally been defeated and i will admit it. i have no idea how to get back on top. i want to be held and cuddled and i only want it from one person. everything is so cruel. so incredibly cruel sometimes. why cant something you want so much just work. why does this still have to hang over my head like this. why cant i get over it and not care. why do i have to care. im so so over it. im so incredibly over this feeling. it makes me sick to the stomach. its this strange physical pain everytime i realise it. fuck i totally lost this, like i lost it more than anything in the world. im nothing now. they are everything. in their lives forever. i totally stand alone. its so painful. i think about it everyday. so goddamn painful and pathetic and sooo incredibly fucked. im so pathetic.
