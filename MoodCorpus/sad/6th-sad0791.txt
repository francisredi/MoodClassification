SAD
one of my paranasal sinuses has been hopelessly bunged up since yesterday. feels like the maxillary. someone rammed a supersized cotton ball right up it and it's pressing against my brain. or am i getting my anatomy right? i dunnooooooo that same person replaced my brain with cotton wool too. dripping wet with toner sans alcool mixed with stale makeup mixed with all the microscopic filaments of urban decay that collide into exposed facial landscapes and stick there and die, the way flies slam into windscreens and stick there and die. right now i want to die. i can walk, i can talk, i can cut the side of my thumb opening a can of Green Giant sweetcorn and smear blood all over the dishes I'm washing and all over the load of whites I'm sticking into the washing machine, and i already want to die. how do people with cancer do it? and i have Seasonal Affective Disorder. the acronym for which is SAD. incidentally, this other disorder that i have, Social Anxiety Disorder (=I hyperventilate, break into cold sweat and lose my bearings in crowds, an inescapable fact of life in Central London. good that I'm living in Zone 2 now, though venturing into Tesco Surrey Quays on weekends does nothing to alleviate the problem) can also be abbreviated into the same three letters, in the same order. take away the capitalisation and you still get me. sad. in all senses of the word. i want to die.



no of course i don't want to die. what shall i do with myself now? play happier music. ok change...uhh nope...don't have any. recommendations please?
