the ongoing theme
I haven't been updating, but it doesn't really matter.  I had a purpose in mind for this journal and I've failed to reach that goal by a long shot, just like everything else.  Now all that remains are random posts that mean little and the constant background of my bitching.

I did absolutely nothing this week.  Well I did go to home depot to get supplies for a project of mine, but like all my other projects it will never be finished.

It's new year eve, most people are probably out celebrating, and I'm sitting in my room hating myself.  A new year, a blank slate, even more chances to fail, more chances to be fucking miserable.  I can't even have fun without wanting to strangle myself.  I can play games to try and distract my mind, but I get too caught up in it and waste away my time and only wind up hating myself for having no will power.  I still haven't applied to college, the deadline is january 15th, I still haven't done my service project hours for goverment, I haven't done any of my work for art.  I have no will power, I have no motivation to do anything but waste time and make myself fucking miserable.  Heh, I guess that's one thing I can do right, make myself feel like shit.

I don't even bother making new years resolutions, it's just another thing for me to fail at.  More fucking lies I tell to myself.  I know I'm never going to do what I say I will, I just don't have the motivation to.  I want it yes, but I don't want to put forth the effort to achieve it.  I don't want to put forth the effort for anything though.  At any rate this all fucking meaningless, just like everything else I do.  And I'm just going to waste more time as I wait for midnight, or maybe I'll just go to sleep.  That'd be fitting, try and hide from the new year like I want to hide from everything else.
