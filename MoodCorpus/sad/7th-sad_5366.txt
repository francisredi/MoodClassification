a look in the mirror
you asked me to look in the mirror.  so i looked and you know what i saw?  i saw you.  i saw you smiling at me when we were happy.  when your face dissapeared i saw myself.  exhausted, sad, discheveled and alone.  i work hard so you dont have to.  yes i am grumpy when i get up from a three hour nap, but do you blame me working 14 hour days?  i work hard so you dont have to.  i love you with all my heart and though i may not show it all the time by god you better believe that i do.  i saw myself alone becasue i feel as though we are drifting apart.  growing apart not seeing each other.  not having dinner together anymore, not seeing movies like we used to no cuddling no hugging not kissing.  i dont know what your thinking, i cant read your mind.  you dont talk to me when i am here there is always something else.  there is always a basketball game on there is always a football game on there is always something.  i cant take it anymore.  i want a LIFE i want a life with YOU.  i dont know if you have figured that out yet.  i know that we have our problems, i know that we will always have our problems, i knwo that i am a big pain in the ass but you want to know what i want.  i want YOU.  i want to be with you and have those problems with you i want no one else,  i want you to tell me that im being stupid when im being stupid, i want you to tell me i have a fat ass i want to get all pissy about it.  i want you to play cards and bet on the games i want all that but i want you too i want your hugs i want your love i want you heart i want your funny hair that grows way to fast and we have to cut your hair every three weeks.  i want you to bitch cause i leave my clothes in the living room when i get up early in the morning.  

my question to you is what do you want from me?
