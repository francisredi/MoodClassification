Second Guessing
"Well, maybe there's a chance you two will make up."

I know she meant well, and I told her kindly I didn't think so. I wish she hadn't said it though. The voices nag at me, begging to talk to him, and its making my stomach hurt...

What do I do with all these memories of you? Where can I pack them away so they stop making me think, and cry? How do I rid myself of this feeling that I'd give anything to have you back? Because there is no getting back what we had. You're different now. But I still miss you like crazy. I want there to be an answer other than loneliness.

And I can't talk to you. I haven't deleted your phone number, haven't removed you from my BuddyList. But I can't, I can't. Even with the voices screaming and making me ache for it. What good would it do. Wouldn't we just yell and argue? And wouldn't it just make me more unhappy? Like listening to your music...Yet I can't bring myself to completely edit you from my life.

Your mom was very nice to me when I told her. I didn't even cry, not one tear, although my voice trembled a bit. I know they'd still like me to come around, but that house and everything in it...How do I convince myself that its better to never look back? I can't let myself hope that you'll change. I have to admit that fairy-tale endings don't happen in real life and you won't call me or IM me. You've already blocked me on some online venues. We won't talk and this won't become magically fixed and I will keep feeling this way.
