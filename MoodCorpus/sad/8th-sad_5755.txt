Can we cast our shadows alone in the dark?  I can't see... without you.
I'm really sad today.  I need to get over all of this.  I wish I wouldn't have fallen for her.  Feelings can be the worst double-edged sword.  If they are mutual, then it can be the greatest experience, but if they aren't, then you're left feeling so low.  It's stupid, little things that bother me, too, like the fact that I always have to call her and I always have to ask when we will hang out again.  I know I'm to blame for this as well.  I know I still get too close.  I know I probably still hug you way too much.  I know I still kiss you on the cheek.  I know I shouldn't.  I think I need some time for me to be alone and see what happens.  I need to see if you would even bother calling if I didn't, or if things would just wither away, because part of me thinks that they would.  I'm not saying any of these accusations are based on anything concrete, but rather just on how I am percieving things.  I hope I am wrong, though.  I already called twice today, and I know I'm coming off as desperate, and I know I need to stop that.
I need to stop thinking about all of this.  I need to have fun playing Dragon Quest VIII, or practicing guitar, or snuggling with my pillow while I watch Judge Mathis or some other lame TV show.  I know if I don't get a call to hang out today, I'll probably be up all night crying or something.  I guess I just don't feel very hopeful about all of this...
See, my journal is pretty personal, too.  I don't know if you'll ever look at it, though.
