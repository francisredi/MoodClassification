It's really not that bad
This will be the second birthday in a row that I've had to spend utterly alone. Well, fourth if you break down "alone" to be "without any close friends or family". I was out with some people on my 21st who I would've called friends at the time, but really it was more like friends of convenience; the best of limited choices, as I've heard the term used before. My 22nd, I spent the day praying that everyone at work had forgotten. I don't mesh well with the "prank" style of male bonding and, regrettably, I seem to be the only one. And then, of course, last year's was Iraq... No more needs be said. Which leaves tomorrow. Get up gawd-awful early, go stand outside in the dark for a few minutes, make two metric ass-tons of copies of paperwork that should be on file to begin with, go collect more paperwork, make two more metric ass-tons of copies, and attend a huddle of sorts to stuff all the copies into one file. That's 6am-... most likely through 10:30am. Then it's back to the room to make a further dent in what I started today; cleaning dusty TA-50! And yes, that will likely take the rest of the day.
Maybe I'll try to go somewhere for dinner. ... or maybe not. I don't know which prospect is worse; staying in alone or going out alone and sitting/eating alone.
I'll be alright. I'm just... sad. Not depressed, not discontent, not cranky, not mopey, not grumpy, (dopey, doc) not "emotionally exhausted". Just sad.
Sad and tired. I should've been asleep already. I mean, I am tired, but I'm not. Happened monday night too. Tuesday was awful.
