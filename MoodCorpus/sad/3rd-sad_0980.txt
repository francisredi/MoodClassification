Cya Cuz...
Today I took an annual leave day for Kerry's funeral.

For some reason, I'd felt relatively detached up until today, but as I sat there listening to Symonne's tribute to her Mum, to Robin's tribute to his wife, I felt a sudden need for industrial strength dessication.  I was inspired to post though, not to tell you I cried, but by the PowerPoint slideshow of Kerry that flicked by on the screen behind during the eulogies.

Towards the end of the service, they called for those who'd brought gifts to leave with Kerry to come forward and place them on the coffin.  As these offerings were brought forward, the procession obscured Kerry's projected image.  The slideshow had halted at a signature shot of her, and this old guy's head was perfectly lined up so that just the outline of Kerry's hair was visible behind the old guy's shadow.

I was left with the feeling that this was the cosmos reminding us that she was no longer with us, and to treasure her memory because all that we had left was images which weren't really there.  It felt really spooky.

Goodbye Kerry.  I hope you've gone to a better place.  You'll certainly be missed in this one.
