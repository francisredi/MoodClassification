Ive been hiding alot, behind everything lately.Actually for a few months. I bet you couldnt tell, but I need major help.I saw an old friend from Bethesda today, I havent seen him in 4 years, and he turned out to be not what I expected at all. He turned out better. He told me I need to stop swearing, its unattractive, and I really do. People change, and Ive changed too. I dont really let everyone know. My mom cant even see it in me anymore, and I used to think she could see right through me. I really dont know who to talk to about these things, because everyone is so caught up in their own worries, and I dont like to butt in, but I have to let somebody know. I feel really sick right now. I keep pushing things down and I dont like it. I feel used by someone I used to love. I guess, maybe its repressed revenge? Ive been feeling sick alot, and all I do is sleep, or puke or other things. I cant be alone, and I mean even left alone. I sit at home all day , everyday..wondering when my mom will be back. I know shes loving life right now, but Im just trying to move on with things. Ive moved on, but Im still standing. Im not going anywhere I want to. I think my habbits changed too. I dont care about certain things as I used to, and I wish someone would stop me but they wont. Im feeling a bit depressed at the moment, sorry for rambling but I have a lj for this reason, and this reason only. I wish things were in order at the moment. I hate seeing other people sad and it makes me nuts.I want to find new things, I dont want to be alone anymore. I wish someone would just take me, for me.
