ok nm here but tonight is not a good night again luckily I got sum cigs. but im done I've been thinkin alot about what happened today and I decided im moving back to my moms house. im sick of living with sumbaody as screwed up as my dad im sick of the constant fighting im sick of dreading going home cause I know that im gonna be fighting with my dad but most of all im sick of not feeling loved and I know that it sounds really cheesy but I dont feel loved and accepted at my dads. he rfuses to accept me for who I am and thinx I need to change everything about me. I feel loved and accepted at my moms she knows I smoke and she doesnt like it but she knows she cant stop me and she lets me smoke as long as I do it outside my dad on the otherhand flips a nut if he thinx I have cigarettes and at my moms I leave them sitting around. I guess that my dad will just neveer be able to accept me and i know my mom does so this is just kinda my way of saying that this summer im gonna move back to my moms I really dont want to leave but I'm tired of the constant stress I have here and I hate being depressed most of the time. I talked to terry about all this and he says I just need to get out of here that I have a chance and I should take it and he's right well I g2g see ya'll
