Hey...blah yesterday was the pep rally which was funny as hell. miss moire made us sit in one spot in the gym because she said she had to take attendance but she never came back to do it so me, kellie, and jesse got up in the middle of the pep rally and walked over to Steve, Ryan, Steph, Nikki, Chad, Anthony, Casey, Jutt, Courtney, Sean, and a bunch of other people. then i came home and steve called to say that he couldn't hang out at caseys because he was going to his moms i said that it was okay, it wasn't his fault he had to go to his moms. So instead of going to casey's to chill with her and Jutt (I didn't want to be all third wheel/sean-ish) i went with Steph to the mall. When we got there we saw ron and started to hang out him. I kinda of flirted with him...and he told me that he misses me and that he always wants to hang out with me and all this other stuff. i just don't know what to do. But anyway we were hanging out with Leo, Josh, Justin, and Ed for a while and we took a bunch of pictures in the photobooth thing. After that i came home and steve called me...instead of going to his mom's like he said he went to Ocean City with Matt and Ami. I was so pissed off when he said that. The sad part is that thursday night he spent like 10 minutes just talking about how much he hated hanging out with them. Then when we were talking he said "you're lucky i love you because if i didn't i definitely wouldn't be lonely down here, i'd have someone with me". Swear to god when he said that i had tears in my eyes...he's basically telling me that he wants other girls. for the rest of the conversation i barely said anything. I just don't know what to do anymore about anything...
