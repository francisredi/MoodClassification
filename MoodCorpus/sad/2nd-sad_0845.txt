a carthartic moment. yet depressing.
so it was brought to my attention that i was a fake person with very little depth and emotion. Unfortinately for some of the people i talk to this is true. unfortinately one of them is someone that i care about more then anything. 

So at work i kept this on my mine all day. I put on an act of ditzy, happy-go-lucky party girl. The ironic part is I hate myself when i do it. It's the alter ego i guess you can call it. And it is the type of person that i would normally want to see being pushed in traffic and hit by a bus, it's that annoying, and it's not me AT ALL. I find myself doing this when i feel i always have to be the entertainment, someone is bored with me, i don't get the feed back i want and need, and when i think people don't like the actual me. which is a really funny smart dorky person. 

Because i'v put on this act before i have lost so many good friends and people. because in fact when i do this, that is when they get bored, annoyed, don't like me, so on and so forth. Also it takes a huge toll on me, i get depressed, bitchy to my family, and pissed off at myself, i totally feel stupid and under appreicated, (which you can see why) I blow off my true friends to be with the person that im putting the front up for and that gets ugly because they can't stand me. i wish to change this pointless cycle of mine.

that's all i guess.
