I just seriously don't get my life sometimes.  I am about to move downtown in another week and a half or so, I have a loving boyfriend who has been with me through hell and back, yet through all of this I feel so alone.  I feel depressed all the time, and normally the only time my hormones flux like this is when it's that time of the month so this time I can't even blame it on that.  I'm so sick of feeling this way.  Why is it whenever my life seems to want to change for the better that I get sad? I am so sick of feeling angsty and blah all the time.  What in my life is missing that is making me feel this way?  God only knows...  In other news, in mention of my moving, I will be moving into the YWCA downtown in a couple of weeks.  Why is that, do you ask?  Why would I want to move into a place like that?  Well, for one, I want to have a set place to be for at least a year that I don't have to worry about where I'm going to live in another month or so or how I'm going to get to work.  I want to go take classes at the Rochester EOC and learn at least a trade so I can do something other than work at fast food until I can really go back to college and do something with myself. On another note, I saw my mom for the first time in two months on Saturday.  I mean literally, I had not seen or talked to her in two months.  She was in jail for a month and just never called me.  Was I supposed to be happy about this? I guess not...  But I told her a lot of what I wanted to say.  I was supposed to call her back that night, but I came home and crashed and have been afraid to pick up the phone since.  I mean, what am I supposed to do?  I feel so freakin weird... I actually had myself convinced that she was never going to talk to me again.  What should I do? I am seriously at a loss.  I know I should call her, but I'm scared to for some reason.  Well, I guess that's it for now.  I really don't know what else to say.  If anyone has any advice for me, please feel free to comment.
