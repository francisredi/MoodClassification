its very hard to think that one drunken night and all the bottled emotions and feelings would just be blurted out of my mouth and then i would be miserable for the rest of my life. 

by now you would have guessed what im talking about. yes, i told mark that i love him. and you know what he told me. "THANKS!" that's what he just told me. after blurting out those words, thats all i get. well, who could blame him. i mean he doesn't fucking love me so what do i expect. i don't have the power to force him to love me. i mean that's pure insanity. im just so plain stupid. stupid, stupid, stupid!!

and the worst part of it all is that i think he's avoiding me na. i mean who would not avoid a girl for saying that out loud. i should have known!! i should have just kept my mouth shout and never have said those words. im so fucking stupid and what you call an idiot. i should have never said those words. now, im sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo regretting it!!! 

i just want to die not only because im embarassed with what i said and did. but also because somebody doesn't love me the way that i do. 

could abie be right?? should i just look for someone else? everybody is telling me that but what's inside me is telling me otherwise. i love him so much and i can't love someone else but him.
