ooooooooooooooooooooh special
friday the 13th oooooooooooooh scary 

actually i am very superstition, i wore my special lucky ring and my lucky panties lol. i called my sister, and mom and brother to tell them to be careful,  all three suggested i seek help. so the ER was hella busy,probably cause its the 13 and the full moon. i watch the doctor put a catheter into a stoma, it was interesting to watch, i got to flush it:)talked to my boss bout my new job in the file room i start feb,
 oh yeah valentines day
my friend called to ask if i wanted to be part of the lonely hearts club. i guess us single losers will go out and get trashed on valentines, then today for some odd reason everyone at work  was talkin bout v-day and where they're going and what they're getting their sweetheart, and blah and blah and blah, ok ok i will admit i felt a little envious, maybe i am a little lonely but ill get over it.    what the hell travis, i think i will take your invitation to get trashed on v-day, let the alcohol flow freely. let it wash away my loneliness, hell maybe ill meet someone nice.
ok im done rambling

lol my brother just told me him going to get a nipple tattooed on each ass cheek so they look like boobs hahahaahha
