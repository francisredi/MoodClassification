Holding out for a hero?
Today is my day off, and I'm spending it in a horrible mood wandering listlessly around my apartment. There's no way I can go to school, now, because I have to get a second job to pay my bills. I know, in my brain, that I'm strong enough to do it, but I'm so afraid of 60+ hours a week...as it is there are days it seems I'll go mad with everything in my head and happening with my family and friends, and put more work onto that and I'm afraid I'll break down. But I can't. Because I have to do it. I have to pay my bills.
Fairy Godmothers don't exist anymore, no one is going to swoop down and pay my rent and bills for me, at least not without expecting something in return. Mom's house lost my W2's, so I'm going to have to get an extension while I figure out how to get them resent, which means another few months without any money....I can't stop crying. I'm so pissed about money, and Dad's back in the hospital and the people I love are always sick or dying or drinking themselves to death. Where the fuck was this written in the small print? That for years and years at a time life is about closing your eyes and just barging through every day, trying not to see how little love is left in your own life. I want so badly to be happy. How do you make yourself happy in the midst of so much shit? I guess happy is too much of an expectation. I'd be ok with 'able to spend my day off doing something besides crying'. Oh, well. Tears have to run out eventually, don't they?
