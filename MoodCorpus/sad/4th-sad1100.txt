new year's eve can blow me
i've always prided myself on not being very bitter come the holiday season. however, with recent events, i feel i have a right to be a little upset. losing misty and my dog were difficult to deal with, and new year's eve has left me alone. not only am i sick (i think i'm getting mono) i also have my period and the worst cramps ever. i'm dizzy and feverish and my thoat hurts and it hurts to move and i just feel like death. then, driving home through lancaster city, people were out in abundance celebrating the arrival of the new year. but no, not me. the only thing that could have made me sadder would be if it started snowing. i love being outside and laughing with friends when it's snowing. not that it's happened any time recently, but i love it. marlin and i obviously did not go out tonight, i'm not sure what he's doing and i don't really care. all i know is that i am not doing anything and i feel like slitting my wrists. i don't think they'd admit me to the hospital and let me go in time for work tomorrow, though. i just need someone to be with me for the night to make sure i don't take all of my pills or something stupid like that. i'll be fine tomorrow, i'm almost positive. once all the celebrations are over i'll be fine. i miss my dog.
