Memories...
So I was lying in the bed of my lover this morning, waiting for him to come back and cuddle me, when I started remembering when I was young.

I was remembering when I was around 8 and was on a shopping trip with my parents. We came across the biggest teddy bear I had ever seen. I bought it with allowance that I had saved for 6 weeks, aka $13. The bear was huge at that time. I would hug it around the chest and it's feet would come down to my knees.

I was thinking about this and wondering about how small that bear felt now, how much $13 meant to me, what a complex concept happines currently is, and what has happened between my parents. It was generally a depressing thought.

It led me to think about where I have grown emotionally and spiritually and wonder where it could be different or better. Of course, there's the stupid thoughts like "I could have made my parents stay together" (which I can't, already know this) and thinking that I could be happier and less depressed if only I had done something... I don't know what, though. There were also the feelings of loss and sadness for my childhood because I no longer get to walk between my parents with my innocent teddy bear and the feeling of smug joy.

Of course I've given up that smug joy for another kind, but I still miss it and I don't get it back. *shrugs* It feel as though it's unfair of me to say this because of the happy life I normally live ("normally" because I am currently depressed and have been rather depressed lately) and the real Meowse I have as a fiance... but it still sucks a fair bit.

And I have cramps.  lol.

Anyway. I think I'm going to get back to the New Years Eve partying instead of being antisocial.
