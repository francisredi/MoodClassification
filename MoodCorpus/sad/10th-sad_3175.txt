people have it worse than i do, this is just soo hard..
" Did u get the present i left on ur bed?,&nbsp; was it good enough or did u want more" she said in an encouraging voice. I lied " mom it was great" . i really just wanted to break down. Presents dont make someone love you, you being there however does.&nbsp;see Valentines day isnt about presents to me its about being with someone who loves you. Im home all alone tonight, most people would be happy. I hate being alone, but it seems like that is the story of my life.All day i listened to lonely people complain or people who got stuff about how they wanted more, or wanted something else and how it wasent fair this person got this and i got that. You are shallow if u think that way, it those people who get me upset.&nbsp;I mean most of them have everything they could imagine, they go home and theres someone there,they get w/e they want when ever.&nbsp;Theres no point in looking for more when u have enough.Than theres others who practically raise themselves who are completely idependent and just are out looking for someone to help them feel hole.I dont want to be alone tonight. most nights i dont want to be alone. I just would appreciate anyone being here right now...but in all reality i know its just&nbsp; going to be&nbsp;me all night..........
