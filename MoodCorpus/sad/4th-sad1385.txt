God, wanna hold him...or maybe I'll jus sing about it...
A boy. A mysterious boy that is so far gone. One, I swear I could read him. -atleast when he was around. One that has dark eyes and hair, tan skin etched in tattoos, scars, and piercings. One that has full lips and a freckle lay on them. I once told a girl that I'd give anything to have a chance to brush my fingers over those soft sad lips and smooth that freckle out. I know him by his tattooed wings on his back, by the tattoo on his neck, and the one on his forearm. By the walls he puts up and the ways he disappears forever at a time.
  I'm numb and cynical because I'm still waiting on something that....god, I don't even know. He's probably found something else that makes him happy by now. All I know is that I only have the energy to love this boy, if given the chance, 'cause I don't remember how to love anybody else. It hurts more than pain because I think it's over and I'm jus waiting on the past, but I wouldn't know. I'm kept in the dark. I can't move on, and I'm not moving on, because I .... maybe had expectations of how things would turn out. So, it would either turn out, or I'd end up alone. So be it.
