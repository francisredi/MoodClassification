Lonely
For some reason I am feeling extremely lonely right now. Mike is back from his 3 week cruise and already he will be leaving for the 6 month deployment here in the next 3 or 4 weeks. It just seems like too short of a time before he leaves. It's going to be tough while he is gone. I am going to have to do EVERYTHING by myself. Pretty much become a single parent for 6 months. I've gone through these before but I only had 1 child at the time and I had friends and family around. This time I have 3 kids and NO friends and NO family around me. I know I can do it and that I will be fine but still...it's scary, especially when there is a war going on. The reality of it is setting in pretty hard lately. Mike might not even get to come back in 6 months...they may stay away longer.
I haven't been on the puter much at all this past week and most likely won't be on at all for the next 3 to 4 weeks. I am trying to spend as much time as possible with Mike before he leaves. *sighs* Please forgive me if I tend to be a lil moody from time to time. And forgive Lovely for I am not letting her on the puter. She misses you all.
