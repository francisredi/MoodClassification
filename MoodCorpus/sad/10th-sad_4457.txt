for all of you
Hello readers, 

Forgive me for not checking your comments last week, I don't receive email notification of them and didn't see them. 

For the two of you that made the comments on my "grapes" entry anonymously, this one is for you.  But before you continue, please know that I'm not angry in writing this, so don't interpret it as such. It's more a feeling of shock and sadness than anything else.

It really hurts my feelings to think that you take so much value with my livejournal as to be insulted by it.  Your comments give the impression that because Guy has been getting more press than others, you think that I am neglecting you all.  That's pretty sad.  (but please don't neglect to notice how much of my journal is not concerning him...)

My good friends, why did you sign anonymously? Why didn't you just pick up your cell and call me?  What did I say to make you think that I didn't value you? You should know how much you all mean to me to know that just because I haven't mentioned you, I care any less about you or that you mean any less to me.  I spent a vast amount of time last week with my friends and helping them with their problems.  Not making mention of them was a move of confidentiality, not neglect.

I do evaluate my relationships with other people, all the time. And I haven't forgotten you ladies/gents that have been there for me.  I hope you know I'm always here for you too, regardless of time or place.
And yes, I do think that he's going to be there for me. I wouldn't be dating him if I didn't.
 
Because of all of this, I've decided to stop my livejournal for now.  My heart is broken thinking that you all don't feel appreciated, so I'd really rather not write anything publicly that might make you feel this way.

I'm so very sorry.
