could i be good enough
ok so i feel really stupid. i forgot how much it hurts. and boy does it
hurt. i used to be so level headed and i wasnt caught up with liking
someone and being stupidly gay about everything that happens. but all
that has changed and i feel so bad. i NEED to go back a few weeks and
just start over. but i cant and its just gonna keep hurting. and i dont
really feel like talking to anyone about it because no one will listen
and they will just say snap out of it and you have other people to hang
out with...and all that. and i know its true, but sometimes its just
nice to have a good friend that i can cry about things too. and i never
want to cry in front of people. so saying that i want someone around
that i can cry infront of should mean that im really upset. it really
sucks when i see people at school that have someone. i just dont get
it. where did i go wrong? it seems that i can never keep the guys that
i like around long enough, and the guys that i dont like but like me
never seem to go away.&nbsp; its just so confusing. i just feel really
lonely at the moment. and maybe im just being stupid and paranoid but
it really fucking sucks.
