The Beginning
I haven't written a sad entry in a while, but today i really do feel sad.&nbsp; I am scared I think.&nbsp; Jon is going away in 6 days.&nbsp; I won't see him for a long time.&nbsp; I feel a little bit lost.&nbsp; Of course I am really excited for him, because I know he is going to have fun, and I know that he has been waiting&nbsp;a long time to go away.&nbsp; It's scary to go from seeing someone practically every day to not seeing them for extended periods of time.&nbsp; I don't want to act sad because it makes everyone around me feel terrible.&nbsp; I haven't even felt like getting out of bed the past three days.&nbsp; It's going to be hard because most of my friends will go away again to school too.&nbsp; I'm really not a drama queen.&nbsp; I don't want to make a huge deal out of the whole situation, and I don't want Jon to feel bad.&nbsp; I know he is worried about how I will be when he is gone.&nbsp; I know it will be ok.&nbsp; I am going to have plenty of things to do.&nbsp; I am not going to be sad the entire time he is gone, even though I know I will miss him the entire time.&nbsp; The beginning is hard though.
I just want to not think about it, and try to make the most of every bit of time I&nbsp;have with him until he leaves.
