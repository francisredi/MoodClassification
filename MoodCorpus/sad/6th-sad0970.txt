An Update
Well, I've sort of had all of my classes by now, and they seem pretty good.  Jane Austen will be a lot of work, but I think the class will be good.  The class I was most excited about, Seminar in South African Lit has been cancelled due to the death of the professor.  It was very sudden, and they don't really know for sure what happened.  He never showed up for his Tuesday classes, and finally someone sent the paramedics to his house, where they found him dead.  They think he had a massive heart attack.  How horrible to die alone.  And in such an awful way.  I just don't know what to think.  I think I'm still in shock, like, "what happened?  Is this really real?"  I don't know what to think, but I also don't know what will happen with my classes and graduating on time.  But as worrying as that is, its not the biggest deal right now.  He had two young sons.   I just can't imagine.  Its hard to deal with because its just so shocking and so sad, but also because there is so much unknown in the whole thing.  Its just so hard to know how to deal and what to think.  

I feel bad. Katie had some work friend pass away, and she told me right as I was leaving for the class.  I told her I was sorry, but apparently, that's not enough.  But I just can't cope with that and Dr. Adera's death right now.  I just can't.  And she blew me off when I told her, telling me something about her vest zipper.  But, its not like I knew him.  But still, its just so hard to understand.  And it brings back memories of things that are even harder to understand for me.  That makes this hard too.  Death is just so hard to understand, even when you trust God.  I'm trying to use humor to deal with the situation right now, but its really bugging me.  But I know I've just got to trust and believe that everything is going to work out, and that there is a reason for all of this, for everything.
