This dose of reality was no figure of speech...
My brain is doing flip flops, and my stomach is tied in knots. Just reach for another bottle and pray that theres not enough. Stupid little words cant save you this time. its funny how you think its all over when its really just the begining...you cant really define the end or beging of something, because the end of something always leads to a new begining. and a begining, always leads to an end.

would you restate your opinion and hold back your investigation? you know you've gotta move on. quit wasting your time on her, waste it on me. becuase im just trash to anyone, so please just trash up trash. nothing could be worse, right? ill take my heart and rip my feelings out before you come by so you cant tell what im trying to signal your way. 

wont you come and protect me from the abuse?

i guess you didnt care as much as i thought someone like you would. if i fall from the ceiling, would you be my landing? youll  find that my condition is worse than you imagined, hurry up and get this girl to the emergency center. 

no one can save her now.

or can he?

-Im certian ive become broken bruised and numb-
