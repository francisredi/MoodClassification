French entry sept: bonne annee
Happy New Years to everyone and good luck to anyone that made a resolution... I think I intended to but I am having too much fun to concentrate on those sort of things!!!

My New Years was spent at Lille with Sara's dad's family. I was completely out of it for some reason, then listening to zillions of French conversations didn't really help, so overall the evening I think was as average as all my other New Years. I think the day is cursed for me. We didn't get back from Lille until late today so I haven't even had a chance to call my parents to wish them a happy new year. I think I will stay up late tonight so that I can!!!

Today on the way back from Lille we stopped at the Australian War memorial where there were a large amount of the allied forces graves from the western front and the huge very somber stone memorial with the names of all the Australians that died there. The Australian graves had personalised messages from their families that were completely gut wrenching. So many of them were beloved sons and fathers that I had tears in my eyes and had to stop reading them. Over half of the graves at that memorial are australian as it was an australian contingent that liberated the nearby town from the Germans as they took back the western front. There were still poppies in the ground and on the memorial from remembrance day. To add to the atmosphere it was an absolutely dreary day with dark clouds, misty rain and really cold. To say the least it was depressing and made me so angry at the world we live in and the inherent nature of man to only realise what to fight for after we have fucked it up.
ENOUGH

I leave for Amsterdam on the third, that is something to look forward to and get me out of this depressed huff. My mum has told me to stay away from "those" cafes... which is the opposite advice from everyone else!!!

Oh and I saw some deer, so all i want to see in the way of wildlife now is a wild boar!!!
