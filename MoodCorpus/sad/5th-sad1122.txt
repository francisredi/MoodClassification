stab me in the heart
so today i went and looked in the mirror and wanted to slit my wrists so bad because i'm sooooo lonely. so instead i decided i'd give up sex and alcohol and drugs and draw big fat X's on my hands to show the world what a good straight edge girl i am.

so i went to my room and wrote 10 poems and they go like this.
And I can't make it on my own.
(And I can't make it on my own.)
Because my heart is in Ohio.
So cut my wrists and black my eyes.
(Cut my wrists and black my eyes)
So I can fall asleep tonight, or die.
Because you kill me.
You know you do, you kill me well.
You like it too, and I can tell.
You never stop until my final breath is gone.

but then i posted them on myspace.com and someone told me that those were already hawthorne heights lyrics! so i said, "holy fucking shit! i'm going to shoot myself like kurt cobain cause i can't do anything fucking right" and went to my room and cried for 4 hours.


and here i am, listening to dashboard confessional and saves the day and death cab for cutie and hoping not to live another day of my pathetic boring life.  oh please someone save me from my pathetic life!
