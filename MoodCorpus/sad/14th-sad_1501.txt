Lonely
Today I am feeling lonely, so lonely. Nobody understands, everyone says "Just get over it" or "Get on with you life" But how do I do that??? It's been 2 1/2 yrs since he left me and I still don't understand why. I am still angry and I still feel like crap about it. So how do you just get over it??? Sometimes I feel the urge to just puke my brains out and other days I gorge myself to the point that I can't move. I feel so bad about myself sometimes that I figure I just might as well eat cause I will be fat forever no matter what I do. Then I realize that I eat and eat and eat to punish myself because I ate! If that makes any sense at all. I just wish that I could get back control of my life and my eating. I need to lose bad and it just doesn't seem to be happening. I keep thinking that if I just can lose like twenty pounds or so that I will feel better. Then again maybe after that it will take another twenty then another twenty, because it has always seemed like it would take twenty pounds, even when I didn't have twenty pounds to lose. Well I guess tomorrow is another day
