well- i never EVER update this thing. it's too complicated, im a xanga girl...

but, im going to try to get better!

things with me are crazy right now, im just so scared of myself and what's going on..  i just feel like everything is spinning out of control. a month ago, i was put in the hospital for a few days, i basically passed out for way to long and had trouble breathing. i have been having these episodes where i faint, or black out, and it's beyond my control. its not just about eating something, i just feel like i've gotten to far into all of this. my mom family want me to go back to inpatient, but i refuse, it's just causing so much stess, so much drama all for somethingi  dont think is worth it. i feel like im so alone in all of this, that im beyond help or understanding, that im lost. i feel like i have used all my favors, that im destined to feel this way. my weekly appts with my doctor/nutritionist/therapists are a waste, a waste of money, a waste of time, my mom has started going with me to make sure that i go, and it's just a battle. i feel like i should be over this, this is taking to much of my life. i just feel alone. 

i know i freaked out last week with all of that crap with lily. it's just hard when someone says what you're struggling with. she basically hit way to close to home, because im not sure how to live like this anymore..

sorry - so so depressing :( i just need a place to vent, or do something..
