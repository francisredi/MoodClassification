she's been everybody else's girl; maybe one day, she'll be her own.
i keep trying to write but everything comes out the wrong way; so bear with me.

it's so hard for me to admit my mistakes, but quite easy to take on responsibility for a problem when it's not my fault.that's what i did for years. i couldn't bear to believe that everything was falling apart around me and that there was nothing i could do to stop it, so i exhausted myself with things i couldn't change. i pardoned another and allowed myself to suffer with my make-believe sins; the results were devastating. i became an object; i made myself accessible at any time, put someone before myself when i was always at the end of their list. my body, mind, and heart were theirs for the taking. and despite my emptiness, my utter lack of self-worth, it made me feel like a martyr. i equated love with death, thought that the more i suffered, the more it would prove my commitment. it would purify me, really make me whole. he ended it, but i persisted. i needed to know that i had not wasted my teenage years, that love really could conquer all. i became an emotional and physical whore. i was given other opportunities, chances to involve myself in stable and light-hearted relationships, but i denied them all. i kissed and told, i led people on, i had no regard for anyone else except the one who let me go. i could not admit that it was over. and even still, i want to know that i was something more than a puppet. i want to know that i was life-altering, awe-inspiring, just plain good enough. i want to know i did not deserve what i got. the anger has faded, the bitterness has died down, and all i have now is the broken self-image that not even the most perfect man could fix.
