Confused
Wow.. i really dont know what to do. I was reading up on depression and taking quizzes to find out if i am one of the few teens who get depressed each year, and every quiz i take tells me to get help from a doctor, or everytime i read a fact about depression i realize that i have been feeling that way, or acting that way without even knowing it is a symtom(sp?) of depression.
I dont know what to do! I dont want to get professional help, but if i dont it will take longer to get over my depression. 
I thought i was feeling  better, but apparently not.
All i want to know is.. WHY ME?!, why do i have to be one of the 4 out of 100 teens who get depressed each year?! What have i done to deserve this? i am so damn confused, i hate not knowing what to do! i cant say that i have always known what to do, cuz havent, but for the most part i think i have. I have never been so bad at making decisions before. 
I've been wondering why my grades have been dropping so much, and when i was reading facts about depression i figured it out.. because a bad change in a teens grades is what happens when someone is depressed. And someone who is depressed shouldnt make any major decisions about anything, so i guess i shouldnt decide whether or not to drop honors english..
The funny thing is, that i think what started this whole depression was school.. or if it wasnt then all the thinking i've been doing about it has been a big joke. Now i'm back to square one trying to figure out what caused this depression i've been in since the beginning of the school year. 
i wish i was better at expressing my feelings.. all i've been doing to fix my depression is running, and i dont even get any joy out of that anymore. 

w/e.. i'm missing desperate housewives...PLEASE leave me one if you have anything to say that might help me, I'm desperate for help, but help from my friends who i trust, and not from a crazy doctor who thinks im crazy.
