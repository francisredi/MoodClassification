Chuckle and sigh.


I LOVE IT.


I finished my online class today!!!!! *dancing* It's like groundhog's day, except cooler because instead of six more weeks of winter, I get six weeks of only needing to be in two classes!

Eh. I'm also getting sick. Goddamn pneumonia, not only are you difficult to spell but you're a bitch to get rid of. Fluid in my lungs! Evaporate! 

In other news, I find it highly amusing that Gary and Krispy are going out. See, Gary kinda wanted to go out with me back in the begining of the first quarter, and Krispy's really adorable and I wouldn'tve minded tapping that. You see the link up? It's funny, really.

Ah, Valentine's day. You whore.

Speaking of, it came upon me the other night just how much I am the girl you don't date. You might think about it, ponder the idea, but really? It doesn't happen. 
Not that I want it to. Hell no, my life is tricky enough as it is, last thing I would want is to get bored! Or something a little more deep than that. But honestly? Dating and me don't happen often. I never feel like the person I've been with is on the same kind of level/wavelength with me, and so it's always been uncomfortable. 

Anyway, that's a whole tangent you don't want to hear about.

I am sick, I am not as sick as Lizzy. *hug* I am tired, I will go lie down and pretend not to feel so incredibly vapid and alone.
