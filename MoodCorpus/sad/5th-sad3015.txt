It looks like another day home, alone, hanging out in the basement all by myself.&nbsp; The computer and TLC have become my only companions. One can only watch Bringing Home Baby so many times though.&nbsp; I just feel so frustrated, I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm being suffocated and abandoned at the same time. I can't shake this feeling of depression. It has left me actionless. I feel so lazy and unmotivated. Something needs to snap me out of this feeling. I need motivation and a real reason to get up in the morning. I really hate school. Sometimes I will find myself laughing or&nbsp;find momentary happiness during the school day, but for the most part, I hate it with every ember of my being. Well, that might be a little dramatic....I just really don't like school-I wish it was more fun. In general, I need to have more fun in my life. I'm always either angry, sad, scared, or bored. I have fun when I do stuff, and I can just be really goofy. But, I hardley ever do anything. I feel like no one ever wants to hang out with me. Like I'm too boring or anoying. Idk......but for the 550th time 
Something Needs to Change
How can I start this change in me?
