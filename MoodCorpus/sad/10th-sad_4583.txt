Awwww Fudge It!!!
Just had some Stupid Pointless Mini-Argument with Helen. I'm really starting to lose my cool about all this. It just feels like I'm having a long distance relationship with someone who isn't even remotely far away! and I bloomin hate long distance relationships. I just don't see the point. Yes I get nice phone calls most days, and it's nice to know someone is thinking about me as much as I am thinking about them. However I haven't seen Helen in nearly 2 weeks, and it doesn't seem like I will see her anytime soon, other than the odd few minutes grabbed at the club. I really don't want to blow this out this early in the game, but it's doing nothing other than making me even more lonely than usual right now. Surely it can't be that f**king hard for her to find an excuse to be out for a few hours in the week. All I want to do is give her the lovely pressie I brought her. And it would be nice to get one evening a week, surely not too much to ask from someone who claims they love me.

All I know is that today it is making me f**king miserable, angsty, depressed, etc, when before it was having the opposite effect.

God Damn I hate myself for being so needy sometimes.

I'm gonna go home lock the front door, dim the lights, and listen to mopey goth music while smoking far too much this evening, and probably go to bed far to early!!
