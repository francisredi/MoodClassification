I want to hit my brother in the face with something dangerous and lethal. That link above is his myspace. Click it and laugh. He is 13. He says he is 19, his user picture is of my best friend, he has a picture of my other best friend on his user pics. A picture of my friend Aubree as his girlfriend and a picture of me on there. WTF? And he goes on and on about how much he loves his girlfriend. Let me tell you how much I dont appreciate being there. Nor do I appreciate him taking photos of all of my friends and making them his life. And I know his password and alll he talks about with his friends is raping girls. In graphic detail about how he is going to do it. It is so disgusting, it makes me sick. He lies to every single person. And my favorite part is how it says he is slim / slender. hahahah. he is fat. myspace makes me sick and revolted anyway, but now even my little brother has conformed. And all he does is talk about raping people. seriously, the amount of blatant lies on that stupid page is more than some people ever tell. Please don't harass him though, he will hurt me if he knows I made someone be mean to him. And he really will hurt me, physically, so if I want to not be punched and hit, don't make him mad. mmkk?

Today was a pretty bad day. My grandma is trying to kill herself, my mom just about had a breakdown, and everything is slowly falling apart. Everyone just cries and tries to pretend they can make it through the day, but we're all just about ready to crack. I keep saying prayers for my grandma. I'm afriad she's going to kill herself before I ever said goodbye. I wish I could do something, I feel so helpless. I wish I were rich so she could come home and I could hire someone to stay with her.
