oh my
I really need summer to come here now. I just got a ticket for parking in a handicapp stop cause I thought we would be in and out in like two minutes, but not....FUCK. Well I guess that'll teach me. I also have a bitch of a bursar bill, AHHH....I just think that money sucks, I mean I like it when I have it, but I don't love it one way or another if I have it either. I just need to get somemore of it and then I might be happy being able to pay my bills and not be broke. Other than that things are ok, I am just burnt out for the year. I'm ready for a break that lasts longer than a week. I love having things to do everyday that don't require me to have to get up at 7 am, that sucks balls. It was a Psi heavy weekend which was fun, congrats Delta Upsilon. I think I decided to run for VP next time elections come around, but then I was reminded tonight that apparently everyone wants Jamal to run, so I probably wouldn't win :( Oh well, I guess we'll see how it goes. I think I am in a mild state of depression. I just feel so sad and lonely right now. I don't know what to do, does anyone else have this problem....why am I asking....no one even reads my journal, and if they do they don't comment, and I don't know why....oh well...I am just gonna go be sad and stuff.
