I know what I'm doing and saying
I slept ALL day today. I got up to eat and that's it. I'm the most lazy person I know. Seriously. I haven't figured out how someone as lazy as me actually does well in school. FYI, I have NOT always been this lazy. It started sometime around 2004.

Boggle died. Yes, I deleted my post about what happened, and my second post about him had disabled comments. I'll leave comments open on this. I didn't get a necropsy done. It would have either relieved my guilt or maintained it depending on whether he died from the foot injury or the respiratory problem. I haven't hurt myself because I think I'm very stupid. I couldn't figure out how to safely cut off oxygen to my foot. By safely, I mean doing it so I don't end up losing my foot. I was not being completely irrational. Irrational Erin would have decided to kill herself and done something stupid then decided to stop like when I drank a spoon full of window cleaner but stopped after that because I decided it was a bad idea (stopped before any slight harm was done). My therapist did email me, and he doesn't think I'm thinking rationally *grumble* He knows nothing about rats and neither do half of you guys so how can he say what he said? At least he cares so he emailed me. I do appreciate that. I'm an email addict and getting personal emails makes me feel good. 

I'll be brave and leave comments open on this. I doubt many people would comment anyway. I may change that, though, or delete this post. I generally don't delete posts once someone has commented, but then again, I delete them too quickly for people to comment.
