Farewell to a Friend
Readers may recall that, a bit of a while ago, one of our rats died of a massive tumour.  I put the body in the freezer in my lab, but did not do anything further with it for a long time.  However, as I have had a bit of a lull in my schedule today, I decided to get some catching-up sorts of things done, and one of the things that I wanted to take care of was the rat in the freezer.  But what does one do with such a thing?  I asked what the physiology programme does with its euthanised mice, and was told that normally they are sent to high schools for dissection.  A rat with a huge tumour might be of interest, or it might not, in which case the body would be incinerated.  Recalling that the body in question belonged to a dear friend, I felt a little uncomfortable with unloading it in such a fashion, but then 's grandmother gave her body to a medical school for dissection, so how would this be any different?  I thought further, and wondered whether the Museum might have any interest.  I kept assuming that they would not, on the basis of the tumour being difficult to skin; furthermore, again, this is a beloved friend that I am contemplating!  But I figured that I would not know for certain unless I asked, so I did.  The answer was yes, they might in fact be interested, assuming that they could figure out how to pickle the body.  Somehow this did not seem like an attractive alternative, and yet, from a purely rational perspective, it is no worse, and may be better, than giving a friend's remains to a bunch of inexperienced high school kids.  Still, it is a sad thing.
