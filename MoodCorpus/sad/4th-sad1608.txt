pathetic patoola
please- dont read this- but if you do- sorry but i told you so.......
im a very sad lonely girl- i like myself as a person and all of that shit but it would be nice to just once have someone else that makes me like myself even more- someone to make me feel beautiful- it would be nice to just once BE desired rather than just desire things that i attempt to have but have no success in obtaining them- it just gets really sad and really old- im just mixed up because i thi k i want what the whole world is telling me to want- i wish i lived on a mountain with a bunch of monkies- monkies are awesome- i enjoy orangutans especially- anyway- this is just a venting jounal entry- nothing to actually provoke important thoughts of the poor SOBs that read this- ive tried to numb myself down but i get the opposite result which is the enhancement of whatever im feeling PLUS the stupidity to act on them- which always results in an undesireable outcome which further causes more intense pain which then in turn causes all the more reason to try and numb it down.  its a whole cycle that has led me to shitty places and shitty times- but i guess its nothing more than anything anyone else in the world goes through- im not special- im just like everyone else- so ishould just join a dating service or write a cheesy emo song and get on with my life- goddamnit- the fucking cat is stuck in my closet- THE END
