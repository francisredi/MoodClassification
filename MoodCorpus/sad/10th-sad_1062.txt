My emotions are going insane, writing in this stupid journal would just be detrimental to my health, and it would just worry you all. Honestly im fine, Im dealing with some serious shit. Knowing someone could do with out you in a big way is heart breaking, especially when that person is you "best friend". But in all honesty, did I expect any different from him? Did I really think that he would change that much? I actually did. And you surprise me none the less joe. I was hoping for a call, like you would have realized I came home to hang out with YOU to see if you were doing better. And you fucking blow me off for some weed! FUCK! why would I expect any different! I just wanted to help. And I guess weed is enough for you. I am not mad at you but myself. I can't stand being fucking dependent on you! I have been since I meet you. You are the only person in this world to ever make me cry, TWICE! Congratz! Its hard to do! trust me. But my feeling are stupid, and I dont want any fucking comments saying, "Jason your too good for him" 
or "he is a lamo just forget about him" Its not like we were dating, were friends and the bare minimum at that, except with the title of best friends. Like I say, My heart will be in something 10 fold as long as I feel I am needed. This is the exception to that rule. I feel pushed aside yet my heart resides with you. Even though it shouldn't and I have no right to be mad or even expect any different treatment from you, I do. I expect you to feel the way I do. Sometimes you act like you are my friend sometime you act like more than a friend sometimes you dont act at all. SO basically, Im never going to leave you but if you dont want me there, I'm fine with that. I'll wait, until you need me. Or if you not around anymore then Ill be there, I ll be there for you no matter what. Make that three times you made me cry. WHAT IS THIS POWER YOU HAVE OVER ME! 

Im glad im alone right now.
