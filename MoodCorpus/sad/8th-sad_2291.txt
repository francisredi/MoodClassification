sad times
Wow, I am sad. Don't get me wrong. I love lawschool, Edd, my pets, my family. However, I am having some bad luck, for real. We are poor, POOR! Edd's stupid work didnt' pay him. We were just barely hanging on when they did, so you can imagine how crappy it is when he didn't.  We haven't been able to go grocery shopping forever, let alone go OUT to dinner. Right now, I would be excited to be able to go to McDonald's! 
    I started going to church, which I thought would help, or at least help me get through this time. As a result, I am more confused. I love going to church (didn't think I would EVER say that!) Every time I go, I leave inspired. One of the first things I have learned in my "enlightenment" is that God is not just ging to give you anything. I am hoping this a test. I want us to be okay. I hate to see Edd sad. Luckily, he quit his job (is it called a job if they don't pay you?) and will start being a server again. I know that I have complained about this before, BUT... He is happy and excited. He will be able to have spending money. Plus, now that he is over drinking (although it will always be there), he can handle working at a restaurant. Plus, since we can't afford to buy groceries, he will be able to eat good restaurant food. (that was a joke).
