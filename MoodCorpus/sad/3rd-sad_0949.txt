Alone for the holidays.
Usually I don't use my journal to talk about depressing things, but I'm feeling a bit melancholy.  I find myself completely alone for the holidays.  I can't afford to go to Seattle (where my family is) and everyone has left Pullman to be with their families.  Even my housemate is gone until after New Year's and he's not even a student.

I'm usually pretty depressed at this time of year because I'm always single (except for 1 year when I was engaged).  I guess this year I'm really feeling the absence of someone special.  I don't feel depressed, but I am really feeling alone.  

Don't get me wrong....my family hasn't abandoned me or anything.  I've actually gotten calls from my mom, dad, and brother fairly regulary since they found out I was here by myself.  I think that is partly because they don't want me to fall into a deep depression, so they are checking on me.  Those days of the never ending emotional abyss are behind me, but that doesn't me I can't be a little sad from time to time.

I have some projects to work on so I don't get completely bored, but not having anyone to talk to can be hard.   More than that, not having someone to touch and be touched by very hard.  I've never been much for cuddling, but I could use it now.

Oh well.
