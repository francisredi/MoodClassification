The Silence Is Staggering
Im here by myself right now and I started thinking about Gabriel.  I've been trying to call him already since I woke up at 12:30pm.  I've gotten no responses or anything.  I am really beginning to worry.  I know Im probably getting all worked up for nothing, but I really deep down love him even though right now I don't respect anything he's done as of the last week or so.  Im still very angry at him but when we spend times together I don't show it because I don't want to spend our time fighting.  I guess it just wasn't meant to be and Im going to have to accept that this is just another relationship failure.  I don't know why no one is picking up the phone but I was hoping he would see me today since he didn't see me yesterday.  There goes the fucking tears of sorrow.  Why? why did I have to fall in love again?  I will never allow myself to fall in love again.  I can't it's really beginnig to hurt like a bitch.  Im the type of person shit like this don't really sink in until after a week or so.  It's starting to sink in hard.  I know this is really going to affect my progress at school/work.  I feel like I have no motivation to do anything.  Casper lended me his Final Fantasy Tactics and Omunasha (I think it's spelled wrong) but, I probably will never play them because I haven't even played games I already have files in.  As y'all may notice I've been utilizing this journal lately.  For right now writing in this journal is the only way to vent out myself.  
Depressed as hell,
