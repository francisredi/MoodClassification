I love Hawaii, don't get me wrong, but I am so bored here!  I don't have a car available to me and everyone's always gone.  I miss my friends.  Even if they are hella far away from me when I'm at home anyway.  When did I get so sad?

Pretty much I've just been going to school with my sister every day.  She was not exaggerating AT ALL that her kids were little shits.  Holy crap.  I don't know how she makes it through every day by herself.  I'm always tired too because my day's so busy, I get up at 5:50 to go to school and get home at 5:30.  I go to bed so early.  I haven't done anything.  Well today I went to my sister's friend's son's 5th birthday party to help out and I got to eat yummy Hawaiian food and hang out, but eh.  Then I just come home tired and my sister leaves me to go out with her friends.  I guess it would be weird though because we are 9 years apart.  (Well she went home to take a nap and then go out.)  Then tomorrow night is my Aunty and Uncle's wedding reception for those who didn't get to go to Vegas for her wedding in October.  It's so sad cause I don't talk to my friends from when I lived here anymore or they aren't here.  It would be weird to talk to them too because I think I'm still thinking of them in that elementary school mind when I knew them.  They all have of course totally different lives now.

So I guess I'll update later about school cause that's pretty eventful in itself.  However, no one will probably care anyway.  School talk tends to bore people.  :)
