I spent all day today in Sylacauga for my grandparents' funeral.  I can say with confidence that I knew exactly 5 people there, out of probably 200.  But I did meet a lot of people, and tried to remember who they were and how they were related to me, but I don't think I did so well on that.  But anyway, the funeral was very nice.  There was a lunch at 12 before visitation, visitation for family and friends from 1-2, then a service from 2-3.  The service was very nice.  Their pastor said some very nice things about both of them.  The sanctuary was completely packed, with many people standing in the back.  It was obvious that everyone there knew how much my grandparents contributed to their community and church.  The organist and indeed the entire congregation could barely make it through Amazing Grace, which they all knew was my grandfather's favorite hymn.  The immediate family then drove to the cemetary, which was out of town.  At 4 my dad and Dona brought the urns out and they were buried.  So sad :(  But Dona read some nice verses from the Bible, which were her favorites and her mother's favorites.

During the visitation, I did get to meet Stephanie Mizzell, who Robin found through some web site.  Robin knew she was related to us through Sycamore, so the last time we were visiting my grandfather we asked, and he knew who she was.  Sure enough, she is a junior at Alabama and is related to us.  Even though I had never talked to her before, or even seen her for that matter, it was still neat meeting someone I only knew through the internet.

Dona is going to stay for the next week as well to get all the paperwork sorted out.  Next weekend my dad may go back and sort through the ashes to see if there is anything worth keeping.  One of our relatives did fine a little Alabama elephant in the office, so my dad kept that.

It's been a very long day and I'm very sore.  I'm going to bed.
