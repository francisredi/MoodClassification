April showers bring May depression
now there is a large ball of nerves sitting in the pit of my stomach that makes me feel naseated all the time. as each day passes it gets larger. i think its a result of me trying to numb myself to all emotion. i am scared of the day when i crack and everything comes seeping out--that day gets closer every minute. it makes me not want to eat or do anything outside of avoiding the condo and sleeping. sleep is losing its appeal as well--especially when the whole waking up part comes. its hard to find motivation anymore. i just want to curl into a ball and cry all the time but that is not a practical thing to do or a good way to pass time. i am trying to live day to day i actually made it through yesterday without crying--well about this anyway. i am going to try to not write about this anymore on here at least and concentrate on other aspects of life. here goes... 

christa and i went to dinner with josh at dora's last night. then we went to boulder and i got my bellybutton pierced. last night i managed to sleep only on my stomach irritating the piercing and i bled a circle on my sheets. i woke my self up a couple times when the pain of friction was too much to ignore. sam also called and texted me when she got home. i barely remember talking to her i was so tired. we woke up this morning around 10ish and proceeded to get ready. met sam at old chicago and indulged on pizza and cookie. i took my sister to meet my parents and i saw one of justin's cousins. she always pretended to not know who i was and this time was no different. i could never tell if she was always depressed or just that much of a bitch. its prolly a little of both, but that's what happens when you breed like an alpaca. anyways, i am going to start tanning. unfortunately it will be fake and bake due to my lack of resources, but its not like its anything anyone else doesn't do.
