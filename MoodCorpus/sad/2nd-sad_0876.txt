Depression
I think I'm depressed. I first realized it last night. I went on a date; it was ok. But, I felt he was too clingy almost instantly. Is that an excuse? What's my problem? I sat and watched television today, and I cried at almost everything. What's my problem?

I've been having a lot of pain in my stomach and I felt a little faint while walking around the mall yesterday. I don't know what it was, I just started getting light headed and a little dizzy. Today, I wasn't excited or sad...I was just...there. I'm in a funk. Why? 

Maybe it's money. It's been stressing me out a little bit this month. December always sucks. Plus, I've noticed how much I've just been blowing. Maybe it's love and that I am emotionally committed to someone who can never commit to me. I don't know what it is. 

I'm not excited about work tomorrow. I took a new position. I don't know what to expect from it, but I know I'm not excited about, and I want to be. It's not that I'm not looking forward to it, I'm just not excited like I could be. 

We'll see how it goes after this week. I hope I feel better.
