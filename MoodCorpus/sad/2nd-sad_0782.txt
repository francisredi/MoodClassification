I don't lose things.
Before today, I can't remember the last time that I've lost something significant. Even with small things, papers and such, I'm pretty organized. Plus, even when I do misplace something I am almost ALWAYS able to find it again. Whenever someone around here loses something, I go looking for it. So that means that whenever I do happen to lose something, that means that it truly is lost. The frustration I feel when things are really lost is huge because I feel like I should have been more organized or that I should be able to find it. It's a pretty crappy situation.

So, what did I lose?

My ToK journal.



(That may not sound like a HUGE deal, but I've put sooo many hours into that thing and I need it to write my ToK essay)


I know I've said a million times that "today is the worst day of my life" but I think today I might mean it. Not only am I sick, have a ton of homework, have lost my ToK journal, have only really half-completed one of my four Stanford app essays (which is due Thursday, by the way), but my grandpa had a heart attack. They took him into some sort of heart surgery (go figure, right when we're studying it) and I'm scared. He has a very very slim chance of living, but I'm still hoping for the best. So, this week, theres a 50-50 chance that I won't be at school tomorrow 'cause I'm sick, and then theres a 90% chance that I'll be in Wisconsin for two to three days for a funeral at some point during this week. I know I absolutely HATE it when people skip school to work on homework or to just stay home and sleep... I will probably be well enough to go to school by my standards, but we'll see. If I found out tonight that my grandpa died, I might not see you guys tomorrow.

What a bad day. What a bad week it will probably be.
