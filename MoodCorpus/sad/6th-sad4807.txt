My Pocky is soaked in tears...
Today was a rather melancholy and depressing day folks.  I woke up late, which is normal for me really, but it bugged me because I start a new job tomorrow.  So I showered and looked for something to do, which ended up being reading my collection of Love Hina.  I finished it in just under an hour and a half, ad felt terrible afterwards.  The ending is really happy, but for some reason seeing it end just like that... it was just kind of sad.  So then I finished reading Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince, which made me cry again, and so I felt even worse.  So I said to myself, "Self, let's do something fun and happy!"  and Myself replied "Why Kevin, that is an extrordinary good idea!"  And so we sought out to finish my current save file on Kingdom Hearts, and life was fun for about an hour, when I beat the game.  Yet another sad ending.  T_T  What's a guy gotta do to get out of this?  It's like God woke up today and said "Hmmm, today I think will be Emo-day."  And thus it was!  So I ran out with my family for a quick bite to eat, and found out that Rain is sick.  Apparently she's caught a cold, and is still somehow not very fussy.  I think mainly due to my mindset of the day, this made it seem tragic, and I had a hard time concentrating on our conversations.  Then I found out that someone I care about is hurt, and there's nothing I can do to help them.  No matter what I try, it only seems to mask their pain.  What do you do in that circumstance???  I went back to their house to do some laundry, and went down to my old room to finish cleaning out some of the junk I'd left there.  But silence is a poor companion when I'm like this, so I didn't get much done.  Finally I came back home, and just decided to give it up.  So now I'm sitting down, reading some Teen Titans graphic novels, hoping that might help.  I kinda doubt it, but hey, I don't like Emo-day.
