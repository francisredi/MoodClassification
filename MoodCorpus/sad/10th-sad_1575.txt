We're sick..
Well as everyone knows, I'm sick again. I'm really gettin tired of this. Now my daughter is sick, sigh. 

I just gave her a bath, she's all wrapped up in her great-grandpas blanket enjoying some 'air time'... meaning I'm checking the suspicion that she's allergic to the pampers diapers. If so, when I buy diapers tonight, I'll try another brand. 

Poor little thing.

She's starting to sleep through the night though, and I'm finally starting to feel comfortable enough to sleep with her in her crib. I'be been running back and forth checking in on her. I guess I'm just nervous is all. Ah well. Anyways, Life is great otherwise. 

I've been cranky (due to the extreme lack of sleep I've been taking myself too) and I chewed out Tomas very unfairly this morning. I apologized, but sometiems that just doesn't feel like enough. I shouldn't be like that. I have no reason to be like that, he isn't my father, he's going to be there for her and me. He isn't going to totally focus on himself. I dunno. I'm just learning. Wish our marriage hadn't started out like it had, ya know? We had so much we really needed to work thorugh first, and now it's kinda all biting us in the bud.
