I am getting fucking tired of watching the olympics.

Daily routine: school, work, come home and hang out with the ski school.

I am tired of feeling like I don't have my own friends down here. I guess ben's post has made me think about this a little bit more the last couple days. I have friends in my classes. I have friends at work, and I have friends that travis works with and hangs out with. But, the people from school and work do not hang out with me outside of school and work, and would travis' friends hang out with just me, or hang out with me at all if I were not travis' girlfriend? I really don't think so. I am disappointed with myself for not having made any true friends down here. Maybe I am not trying hard enough. Maybe I am putting too much pressure on myself. I don't know, but I am becoming very lonely. 
Lately I feel like part of what is getting in the way is living with my boyfriend. I feel like it is a crutch for me to be able to come home and always have a friend here, always have someone to hang out with. It is making me lazy at making friends. I want to move out, but am scared shitless. Scared because Travis would be so upset, and scared because because because. 
And things with travis.... I just don't know right now. I have become so skeptical of having a serious relationship at this point in my life. I don't know why, I just feel like I am so young and have missed out on something...I am not sure what, but something. It has stressed me out so much, I am not enjoying anything right now. I just want to be very far away. Really really far away.
