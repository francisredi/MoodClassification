i know i just updated a few minutes ago but i have something to get out for the entrie school day and most of work i felt as if i was sliding away from myself and losing purpose if i even had purpose in the frist place. i just felt really bad and depressed today just very not happy even though it was a ok day. but at work that depression just turned to hate of my stupid dumb manager who likes to crack jokes and play around then whenever i try and do that or hit him back with a dis he'd always say get back to work. well for the frist time in a long time i started to question my existice and the existice of others and what is going to happen in the future and my own death of how i wanted to leave this world and i look at old ppl that can't even remember their own names, i don't ever want to be like that some ppl say that life is to short, but to me it seems like it can't go by fast enough. i have alot of stuff flying around in my head and i just need to figure out where i want to go in my life and who i want to be with, this isn't fun for me and i'm really going to have a hard time with this but never the less time will continue to tick- tock back and forth. 
now i'm just going to go into some quotes from history class.
