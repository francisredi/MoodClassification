Brokeback Mountain
I went to the 1:55 showing of Brokeback Mountain with my oldest friend, Julie. There are two theatres in Boise that are showing the movie - one is the alternative, independent theatre and the other is the large 21 screen cineplex. We went to the cineplex because I had free movie passes (sorry independent). 
   I was amazed that this movie was playing at the cineplex, one, and amazed when I saw that it was playing in one of the larger, 300-person theatres at the joint. I think I was amazed because this is Idaho and to secure a large theatre for a gay movie is wonderful but maybe that was how it was when Philadelphai played or Boys Don't Cry played -- I was not in Boise then but maybe it is not an unusual thing.
   I loved this movie. When it ended I was faced with lots of emotions and I held on to these for the drive home and even now. I was sad because of the love that the two cowboys had for each other and continued to have for each other but lived a closeted straight life because that was expected of them. I was also sad because I am 32-years old and I long for love. Even if the love was small snippets over 20 years. I guess I am the sad one.
