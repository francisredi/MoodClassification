Aw, shit.
So Puss the cat, my cat, is going to be put down tomorrow at around 11:30 am.

See, she's kind of got a huge nose cancer (very visible, oh yes- no more nose) which is now apparently making its way, as cancer is wont to do, I suppose, to her right eye.  The Vet tells Dad that it would be merciful to put her down.

I disagree, personally- I won't really go into why, save that I believe Puss is capable of making her own decision about whether she wants to be worm-food.  But this disagreement is duly noted, considered, and passed on.

If you're wondering, at the moment I am actually almost utterly unfazed by this.  The whole Puss-dying thing, I mean.  Hey, sure, it sucks and all, 'specially if you're her, but I don't feel all grief-y and denial-y or anything.  I barely even feel very sad.

This is partly because the future has no real hold on my mind, this is true.  Too many years of teaching myself that my imagination isn't real has actually succeeded and now I can't really tell how I'll feel when she dies.

I guess the other part of it is that, due to various Mitchell's-own-personal-religion based thingamibobbits, I actually don't see death as a big issue.  I won't really go into that, either, save to say two things- one, it is a religion of exactly one, me, and comprises merely my beliefs about the universe as a whole, and two, I believe in reincarnation of a sort.

Or it could just be that I've accepted that death is a natural thing, entirely pointless to worry about.

I guess we'll see how I hold up tomorrow.
