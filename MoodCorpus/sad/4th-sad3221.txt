Candy Cane + Hot Cocoa= Yummy
Something Tom said yesterday made me both very happy and very sad at the same time. Call me unoriginal for quoting song lyrics, but this pretty much sums up what it brought to my attention.

However did you manage to push away
Every living thing you've ever loved
So afraid that anyone would hate you
That you pretend you hate them first

Due to social circumstances before high school, no matter how close I am to anyone, I always assume that whenever they don't want to talk to me or don't show up to events they said they'd be at, no matter what their excuse, that it's really because they don't like me anymore. I've had "friends" do that to me one too many times, so it gets kind of hard to quiet that little voice that keeps saying "It's only a matter of time before they leave you too". Especially since most of my friends from school last year DID leave, either physically as in they're not there anymore or in other ways like they ignore me when I try to talk to them.
I don't want to be alone. But it seems like no matter what I do, I always will be. At least this way it might not hurt as much.
