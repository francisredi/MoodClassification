I'm finally one of those people I don't get. The ones that always cry, the ones who feel empty and needy.
Lucky me. Tonight I feel exceptionally shitty. I'm depressed for so many reasons. I'm starting to quesiton my sanity.
my legs and arms and shoulders are tense from day of crying and stress. I'm starting to become irritate about everything, and I'm not sleeping properly. My body just feels ravaged. I keep having that metaphorical dream and it only makes me sink into a deeper depression. I feel the need to escape from life. It always seems to catch up with me though. 
I'm so tired of this fuck up mixture of sadness, guilt and anger that I just feel like I'm going to shutdown. 
When that happens I stop eating, I stop sleeping and eventually I stop thinking. I can't stop thinking about the crazyness that has been my life over the past 4 months or so. There are so many things I want to say, so many people I feel as though I need to talk to, yet I know I never will. 
I'm so emotionally drained.

Someone come kiss away the sadness. 

I'm gonna write tonight. Fuck maybe I'll stay up and finish my stupid book.

perhaps.
