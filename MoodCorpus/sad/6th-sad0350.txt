Why Do these things happen to me.
Today started off like any other day. woke up late, ate some Trix, didnt do my hair...u kno the usual. well i get on the East Residential to get to campus, and well, the stupid driver got us into an accident and crashed into another car. i was like daaaaaamn, the day is not starting off well. so the accident resulted in me having to walk to campus. and i got really hot, and sweaty on the way walking..i wasnt too happy about that. SO that was incident number 1. so im walking to campus, decided to go through the union  to take a break from the rain. as i walked out the front door i was walking down the steps and slipped and busted my ass. i dont even know what i slipped on, i just remember seeing my umbrella fly into the air and feeling my tailbone/ass just hit the edge of the step. and feeling an awful crunch go through my back.i got up, all muddy, and wet. My ego bruised, but not as much as my ass was. i fell so hard that i ended up scratching my arm up through my coat. it was rough. luckily, thankfully, no one was outside to see me fall. i just got up and ran to the bathroom and attempted to clean up. so that was incident number 2, and after that i just decided to take my accident prone ass home. thats all i have to say about my day. my plan is to try and make it to the RPAC tonight just to walk on the tredmill. dont know if thats happening. good luck with studying everyone.
