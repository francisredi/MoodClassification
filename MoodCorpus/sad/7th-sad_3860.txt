so somehow ive managed to get a girlfriend. and i dont like using the term girlfriend so im gonna say 'wicker basket.' alright well im really depressed right now... yup. she's great and i dont know why ANYONE would bother with me. i hate this. why do i think people have some kind of deeper motive? am i that paranoid? im really insecure. she's really amazing and i dont want her to be sucked into my problems. im horrible. i get depressed all the time and if she's looking for the right guy its not me-- not even close.

the band is going pretty well and i think i might go to adelphi. so i guess im set, right? i wish i was, but something feels wrong-- something always feels wrong to me. i dont get it! im suppose to be happy, but im not!! what is wrong with me?! me and carlos were talking about how some guys complain when they have everything and im starting to think something is seriously wrong with me. i have no reason to get depressed sometimes, but one thing can become something big just because i think too deeply and other worries arise. I HAVE TO STOP THINKING! im a pessimistic little fuck and i should shut the fuck up. which i will do...right now.





p.s. ive got a knife.
