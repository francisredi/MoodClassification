Heartache
Adam's been acting weird lately. Last night, I called and he didn't answer. So when he called back, he was like, "I'd rather not chit chat, so unless you need something, I'll talk to you tomorrow. I'm lonely and depressed and don't want to talk." I was a little upset, but hey, he's been having a rough time with his grandfather and everything, so I kind of let it go. Tonight, he seemed to say that it would have depressed him to talk to me on the phone instead of having me with him. But then, I was like, "Hey on the bright side, I'm coming home for Easter." And then he told me I didn't have to and my mom would be hurt. It just seems really odd to me, like he was trying to deter me from coming home. And when I asked him why he didn't want me to come home, he said, "No reason at all." But the way he said it, I could tell that there IS  reason, and he won't tell me. Then he said he couldn't talk to me like this in front of his parents, and hung up without saying anything but bye. Meaning no "I love you." And he knows I hate it when he gets off the phone without saying that. So this leaves me to go take a shower and cry and wonder whats going on. *sigh* Hopefully Mass with Caitlin will cheer me up. Yay for Palm Sunday, at least.
