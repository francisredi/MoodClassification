New Beginnings
Alright so I deleted all my entries cuz they're old and dont apply anymore. I never updated this thing I'll try to start again but for now a new start.

Depression is still plaguing me I'm starting to think I should go see a psychologist about it because this is getting nasty at points. Its hard right now I have nobody to talk to my parents would just get overworried, my friends all look to me for support so I cant really talk to any of them and I don't have a girlfriend who I can just talk with.

Its coming up on the anniversairy of Joe's death and thats hitting me pretty hard making me sink lower than I already was. I watched Castle in the sky which is a @#$!ing beautiful movie but his movies depress me idk why. Maybe because they remind me of Sam. They remind me of my love troubles I guess.

I'm in classes and actually doing kinda well for once, my Dad is hopefully going to enter a clinical trial for the closest thing to a cure they can get for his cancer. They call it that but its basically what it is. I hope he gets in but it will make life harder for us because long term disability means he's only paid 60% of his base salary. So now on top of my depression, classes, and dealing with my dad I'll have to start looking for a job again.

In general things could be a lot better and I hope I can pull out of this depression soon but my hopes aren't too high.
