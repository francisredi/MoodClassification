boring, boring, boring
Well I haven't worked since last saturday, yes I know it has only been four days, Kelly keeps telling me this.  But I am freaking bored, bored I tell you, nothing to do, but sit and look at stuff on ebay.  I bet Kelly is kicking himself about now for showing me this wonderful site.  I hadn't ebayed before this, but now I am hooked.  Recently I have bought over 12 jewelry items, from rings to necklaces to even my engagement ring.  I have bought loose stones, old coins, and am now bidding on some translucent drawstring bags.  Why?  I don't know, because they are a good price and I am bored.  I am now wondering how many pieces of jewlery can I wear at one time?  Or perhaps I have just bought for everyone on my shopping list this year? 

I think I could find more to do with my day I am sure, but how many times can one hear the same italian lesson or do the same lesson on elements or read the same book, day after day after day.   So today I am leaving the house to pay some bills, most times I would just pay online and be done with it, but this gets me out of the house and doing something.   So off to buy Joey his bus pass, buy my thyroid meds, pay a pharmacy bill, check out the D.I. for some old jewelry I might want to sell on ebay, pick up something for lunch, and back to check on my ebay bids.  

Time to go look for a new job I guess.
