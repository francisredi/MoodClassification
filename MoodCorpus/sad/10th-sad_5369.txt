im so tired i dont even wanna press the shift key.  my whole being is just kinda like whatever.  

i feel weird.  theres still some of his stuff here at my grandmas where i'm staying, and im almost afraid to touch it.  like as though moving it or touching it is going to summon ghosts.  my mind is a dangerous place to be.  i doubt that im the only one thats felt that way with others' personal belongings, but its just so weird.  

its so windy out there tonight.  i can hear my grandmothers wind chimes out on the porch.  and it is so dark.  so cold.  so lifeless out there.  

you know the five stages of grief or whatever, i think i'm sitting on four out of five, every one of them but the acceptance stage.  denial, anger, bargaining, and depression.  that pretty much sums up the way i feel when left to my own devices.  

its contradictory because i dont think ive ever felt more loved, or more lonely in my entire life.  i feel split in half, a la susannah.  

damn its windy.  if i go out to my car to go to work tomorrow morning and its flipped over onto its side, im going to be really upset.
