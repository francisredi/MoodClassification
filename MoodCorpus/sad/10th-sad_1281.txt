everyone leaves
So I was walking home from school on Friday and it was frezing, and I started thinking about how everyone leaves.  First Janet, then Mike...oh it sucks.  I don't open my heart up or become real great of friends with many people.  So when they just decide to stop being my friends, I question my worth.  Aren't I worth fighting for, keeping in touch with, am I so easily replaced?  A thought in the back of my head tells me it's not me...these things just happen.  Well, when I was walking I remebered that Natalie is leaving too.  I'm so happy for her, that she found love, but it hurts too.  She didn't even question whether to stay, whether he could move here.  She doesn't care about leaving her family, so basically she's choosing Bo over me, choosing a guy over me as a friend again.  So then I realize, that the thought in the back of my head is naively optimistic, stupid, and wrong,  because 3/4 odds are pretty bad.  My friends suck.  Not that I want Natalie to give up Bo, I just am sad that even though she isn't sure its gonna work out between them, without a second thought, she would rather be with him than be a friend to me.  My life is meant to be a lonely one, and I can't think of what I can do alone, other than sit in my house with no heat and crochet.
