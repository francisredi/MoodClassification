dear anyone and none
"What if you should decide, that you don't want me there by your side"
I don't even know what to write. SUCH a horrible day today. Everything went wrong. I've decided that my mother hates me, and no matter what I do it isn't going to help. She yells at me for everything. Says I'm a disgrace. Swears at me. Can't get through a sentance without saying 'fuck'.&nbsp;My dad, he tries to respect the fact that I hate it when they swear so much, but not my mom. She's making me BUY&nbsp; MY OWN FOOD. I wanted cashews, but apparently she doesn't want to spend the money for them. wtf. I'm not even getting 6 hours of sleep a night. I attepmt it, but I can't get to sleep before 11:30 anymore. I always try and hide the fact that I'm sad when I am, because I try and be strong for friends. When their sad, I'm always there for them. My mom wants to pull me out of SMUS. Apparently I'm not worth the money, and I'm not getting good enough grades. Well sorry for the fucking C in Spanish, try as I might I DON'T&nbsp;FUNCTION SO WELL WITH 6 FUCKING HOURS OF SLEEP A NIGHT.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm getting pushed over the edge.
And I feel lonely. I shouldn't, because I know my friends care a lot, but I still feel so alone.
&nbsp;Sorry for complaining.
I just need a hug.
