Fat. 
Well.. now don't I just feel great about my body. NOT. I went downstairs to ask one of my parents to borrow their credit card to buy tickets over the phone for the City and Colour concert on March 9 and my dad mentioned how fat my legs were. He was looking at the side with my huge lump of scar tissue (which I also hate about my body). So I mentioned that. Then my mom piped up, who was on the other side of me that no, actually my legs were looking huge. FUCK THAT. My legs are the thing about me that I am MOST self conscious about. I feel just dandy. NOT. I feel like fucking starving myself. I AM NOT OBEISE! Then when I was coming upstairs my dad said that there was chicken on the counter if I wanted. Am I hungry? YES. Am I going to eat? FUCK NO. All I said to him was "No, I don't think I will eat. I don't want to get any fatter than I already AM!!" GRRR. Then I went and cried the whole time in the shower and now. Like... parents aren't supposed to be so hurtful. I am not fat. I will never have chicken legs. Have I been eating right? Yes. Have I been working out? YES. So what the fuck is their problem and where the fuck do they get off ganging up on me and pointing out how fat my legs are. FUCK THEM! I hate them both so much. I never thought my dad, after years of being riddiculed by my mother would stoop to her level. That is what hurt the most. Like maybe I should point out and riddicule some of the things that they hate most about themselves and show them how it feels.
