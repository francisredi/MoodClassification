"How Soon Is Now?"
"How Soon Is Now?" how did that song go? I know for sure there is a line in the song that goes something like "I am human and I need to be loved Just like everybody else does" is that a lot to ask for? I mean don't I deserve a little happiness. I mean everyone deserves happiness. I am so sick of crying everynight. I am sick of hurting. I am sick of being slient when inside I am screaming at the top of my lungs. And please don't leave me a comment saying you know how i am feeling. Please don't tell me that you are in my shoes and know how i feel. I don't need anyone in my shoes. As don't leave me a comment saying you are here for me when in all reality i am falling apart in your presence. I am so sick of being so lonely and being surrounded. I don't want your pity, that kills me. I really don't want anything from life except to be happy and to be with people who actually care about me. SO maybe you are asking yourself why bother on stuff like myspace/xanga/facebook/etc. wanna know why i bother? because inside i am a little girl who is crying for someone to come hold me and no one hears me. here is the real kicker no one cares enough to hear me. SO before you go saying "Ashley I am here for you." think about that and if you are going to say make damn sure you really are here for me. 

Bye

Oh and five months today.
