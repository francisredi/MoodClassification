I had comletely forgotten about this thing until I put in a mix cd I made three years ago.  I really miss the earlier days of college.  These days I don't really hang out with any groups, and all of my friends are scattershot and random.  I hang out on rare occasions, I haven't been to the bars in months, I rarely play poker with the guys, I don't have any group that I can call "the guys".  I am engaged to Jenny now, and I love her so much and I really love spending time with her, but I need to have my own life too, with my own friends.  It's not her fault that I don't have this.  I just don't put myself out there enough to meet people, and the opportunities that I do have I just waste because I don't feel like socializing at the time.  I was supposed to drive to Denver to see my friend Brandon, but I couldn't afford the trip.  It really upset me because I was looking forward to just going back to those old times, even if it was only going to be for a week.  It's pretty crappy when you realize that one of your best friends is over 500 miles away.   I want to change so much of my life right now.  I still want to marry Jenny, but I wish I could relive the last few years and spend some time with my friends.  I am looking forward to starting a career and seeing what I can make of my life, but I'm really scared that the social part of it won't develope.  It's funny; I'm ENGAGED!  I'm going to have a friend for life, someone to share everything with, and it makes me so wonderfully happy.  But I still feel kinda lonely.
