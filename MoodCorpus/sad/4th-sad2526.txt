Just whinging...

My fat-boy (Scrapper) is sick.  He has had struvite crystals in his bladder for years. He almost died before we got him to the vet the first time and figured it out. The solution is simple. A certain kind of food. We started using Nine Lives for urinary tract health and it worked out great. Some folks actually have to go to the vet and buy others foods and they cost huge.  The retail stuff worked fine for the Fat Boy and he's been healthy for years. Recently, however, Mom decided that food was too expensive with all three cats eating it and since I didn't have any money to pay for it myself until recently, I went along with it, unwillingly. Well, now he's sick, and he's bleeding, and I have no money to take him to the vet until at least the 10th, and no way to get him there. I don't even own a cat-carrier. I'm frustrated and angry with Mom, and worried about my cat.  In the meantime, I have to keep him locked up in my room because he's leaving blood spots on everything and I don't want my father wigging out on me because of it. Poor thing's sitting in front of the bedroom door whining.  Bleh.
