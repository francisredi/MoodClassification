Po-Mo's Rant
I hate labels, I really do, but now I must tell you that my sister was right when she labeled me a post modernist. I think that the world has hit it's carrying capacity (for lack of a better word, or would cusp of technology and advancment be a better word?) and now we're on the downfall. You know, everything that comes up must come down.
Did I know that this will happen when I signed on to be on the United Nations Committee for Tech and Environment, it would raise my aniexty about the state of the world. Or is it the fact that my father bought me form uber left-winged nutjob of a magasine called Adbusters (nothing is fair and balanced anymore)and it's just spooked me out of my mind.
I just started freaking out and feeling dizzy when I was cuddling my little brother (he was trying to get to sleep) i mean I was once thinking about how bad it is to be born into this world (i am totally expecting shit for this comment, I mean, if you know that the world was doomed, would you have a child? I mean, my mom keeps on saying that there have been worse times....but that was war...not mother earth)
I think my food poisoning is going back...I can not puke anymore...it was completly gross yesterday..i've thrown up stomach acid before...but never stomach mucus (yes TIM)

Buffalo tomorrow
