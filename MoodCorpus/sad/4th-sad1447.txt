one last deep sigh
Rachel Engelhart age 24 died last night alone in her car.  she was usually a cheerful person but circumstances of new years eve 2005 caused her death.  Rachel only had two fears in life the first was the dark, and the second was being alone.  unfortunately for rachel, her killer left her in both.  witnesses say that her last words before dying were "i'll just wait a little while longer".  her death came as a shock to all including herself.  witnesses report that it was over in about three hours, and near the end she was in a great deal of pain.  her sobs could be heard for miles and after hours of waiting for her love, the tears that ran down her face felt as if someone was dragging a knife over her cheek, slicing every muscle that would ever allow her to smile again.  Rachel had loved only once before in her life but as her death seemed to show us all, this love although it came on much more quickly than the previous was a greater deeper love.  a love that left her alone in her two greatest fears...to die.  

i of course did not really die, but everything else is true.  his love for me ended before the roses ever had a chance to wilt.  there is no such thing as quick and painless.
