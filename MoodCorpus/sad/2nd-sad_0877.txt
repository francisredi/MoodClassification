you lie. everything you are was just a symbolic terror
i slept all damn day. i was so bored i did absolutely nothing, but sleep and eat and watch really old movies. the only productive thing i did today was watch when harry met sally. i've never seen that damn movie, always been meaning to see it. been a tiny goal of mine to see these little movies that people rave about but have never seen. well, i can plainly say that sleepless in seattle is so overrated. or maybe i'm just not much of a lovey dovey chick-flick movie person. *shrugs*

jazmin spends the night tonight. and the sleepy girl chooses to sleep in my bed til i kick her out. she's adorable, beautiful, and so innocent; the complete love of my life. but all i can think right now is i hope she doesn't drool all over my nicely clean bedsheets. i'm horrible, arn't i?

why does everyone seem to fade away from me as soon as they have somebody in their lives? you hardly talk to me anymore. wth? was i just there just so you wouldn't be lonely? i still care and wonder what's going on with you. i know your not afraid to talk to me. fucking whatever, i guess i'm just a distraction.
fuck.

i'll be aware for awhile. *sighs* this isn't good when i feel like this.
