I want out
I'm beginning to think I'm sick in the mind, that I keep myself depressed and keep beating myself up over this. If I just told myself, Ok enough, I'm going to just let go of this, I probably could and lift the weight off my heart, but NO. I don't know which part of my irrational mind keeps clinging on to the past, doubting the future, and stops me from telling myself enough is enough, give it up. I could come so close, and my heart starts to race like crazy, and my mind backs away from the threshold, chosing to coddle my pain and depression, and slowly wring the happiness out of me. 

Do you feel my frustration, that I'm in panic mode? A part of me just wants to get back in this relationship and try to untangle all the knots to make it perfect like it once was, but I know j doesn't want that. Hell he doesn't even want me anymore. So that's out of the question. I hate it when people keep telling me the right one will come along. Seriously, fuck that. There'll never be another j, or anyone else who could find me worth loving. Someone just kill me, I don't have the courage to do it myself.

i know you may not want to see me
on your way down from the clouds
would you hear me if i told you
that my heart is with you now

every time i hear you laughing
hear you laughing
it makes me cry
like a story of life
of life
is hello goodbye
