school starts.
school has started. had lessons yesterday from 8.30 am to 7.30 pm. Am still trying to adapt back to waking at 5.30am, squeezing with the crazy crowd on the mrt, if i'm unlucky - standing all the way to boonlay and in the bus to NTU (for 2 full hours) to and fro, if i'm lucky - trying to sleep on the train. And today's lesson was from 8.30 am to 12.30pm. Trying to get used to being "alone" this sem because Renita's timetable is different (due to some registration thingy, ntu's system is screwed). yea. 

i had an afternoon nap cos i was feeling really tired having to wake up at 5.30am for 2 days straight -.- but i made a mistake by sleeping on a full stomach. i had terrible horrible nightmares. :( i woke up feeling really really depressed. and still am. waiting for him to call me. really need some comforting. 

i think i'm a really paranoid person. i'm really afraid my dreams will become reality. or maybe it's just what i'm afraid will happen. but still. urgh. i can't help but feel really depressed. :(

add drop period is tmrw. gotto wakey at 9.30am just to change a friday tut to monday, so i can be in the same class as Renita, also i'll have lessons on mon-wed, meaning i got a long weekend! hahahha, that is provided the friday slot is not used. :p *pray there will be no makeup classes or guest lecturers* haha but i guess when project work starts full swing, i won't even have free days. :(
