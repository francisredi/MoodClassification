Hey all, I was just sittin here thinkin. You know, all I've ever wanted to do in life is to help others. You know, like if they're feelin down, or worthless, I just wanted to be there for those kind of ppl to help talk them thru it, so that way they feel better. I guess its like this urge to save others. I don't know, maybe I'm just stupid for feeling that way. It just makes me so sad and depressed whenever somebody else is depressed. I guess now would be a good time to tell yall that I'm an empath. No matter how I try to block out other people's emotions, sometimes they come leaking in, and it makes me want to cry. I don't mean to be weak like that, tho. Me personally, I've been told that I have a big heart, however I feel sadistic half the time. There are times I just wanna kill somebody, you know, torture them slowly, and relish in their screams. But I know I wouldn't get away with it, that's why I haven't ever killed anyone. So instead I sit back and watch gory movies. I take so much delight whenever a killer actually kills his victims. I laugh. I fucking laugh and enjoy it. However, if I were to come across someone I don't know with tears in their eyes, I sit down with them, even tho they're a fucking stranger, and I see if there's anything I can do to help. Sometimes I can, sometimes I can't. I swear I have some kind of split personality thing going on. I'm filled with peace and rage. It sometimes feels as tho its gonna tear me in half one day. I feel so conflicted. Anyway, I was just thinking about all that. Maybe that's my problem. I think too much. Oh well. Well, that's it for now. Peace out.
