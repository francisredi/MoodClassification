All and none
It's funny how when you need a little encouragement, everyone suddenly goes silent. When you need friends around or would just like a "feel better" message because they've heard that you're sick, there's no one there. I suppose I'm guilty of the same things. I get caught up in the goings-on of my own life and don't always take the time to notice what's happening in the lives of others. It's not my intention to offer some indictment on the world because I understand that we all have only so much time and attention to pass around. I'm just sick and feeling more like a leper every day. The only thing I'm going to do now is resolve to be better about observing the subtleties and nuances of how people are feeling and try to make them better if they're down, cheer them up.
My mom came over this morning, though. She did my dishes and made me chicken noodle soup and took some time for me, so that made me feel good. My parents are really pretty good to me.
I e-mailed my UHON professor and asked if I could take a sick day tomorrow. That'll make two days of sick days for me (today and tomorrow), but I still have a fever and chills, more or less. I'm coughing and sniffling and other horrendous things that are probably better quarantined in my apartment than spread out into the classroom. I've tried to keep going, but things haven't been getting any better. Being sick is the worst.
I think I'm going to put a mindless DVD on or just go to bed...
