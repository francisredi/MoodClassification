Conduct grades, concert, currently very sad
Because I am the fool that I am, I have lost all possible chances of getting a Third Honor for this quarter. Heck, even my hopes of getting a merit have been dashed. Congratulate me for being immeasurably stupid, and slap me across the face for sleeping in the bathroom: I have three minor offenses because of nine unexcused latecomings, a grand total of A CONDUCT GRADE OF NI. Congratulations Apo. You are officially the stupidest person I know.

Dear God, I know I haven't been treating my merit cards with much appreciation, and I know I'm always saying that I really really want a Third Honor, but I would readily give his ultrasweet YM messages, our conferences, and even the possibility that he likes me back, if it means that I'm still going to be getting a merit card for the 3rd Quarter. I know that sounds terribly shallow and nerdy, but merits are all I have now. :( I can't afford to lose the only thing that's been keeping me happy through every single quarter.

I'm sick of crying. I've had too much today.

CIENTO NG ST SCHO CONCERT

Our Glee Club is still THE best ever. Although St Scho Marikina had some great choreography, in terms of voice and effect, SSC Manila is still my number one. When You Believe and Sino'ng Baliw were absolutely terrifyingly beautiful.

The Holy Family Academy Glee Club also took part in the concert, and one of them looked SO MUCH like Hemhemhim</u. Hahaha. Go Glee Club!

If only I knew that this was how it was supposed to have happened, then maybe I could not have let him do this to me. Prevention
