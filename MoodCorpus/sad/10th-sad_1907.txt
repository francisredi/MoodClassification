i want to apologize for being so cocooned for the past little while. this extends far beyond the reaches of lj. work is driving me crazy. my coworker said to me just now: don't get sick, michelle. why are you still here? you are getting yourself sick b/c you bottle things up and then it comes out as sickness."

she is 100% right. i mean, who can *really* say where this ever present illness is coming or going from, but it is a problem, and i would attribute it to the things i don't deal with proactively, like my coworkers, my job, certain other people.

but it's really hard when things are so overwhelming that the only way to see light at the end of the tunnel is by doing work and thinking that you can get through the actual shit and then there will be peace. but i am realizing that no matter how disciplined i am here, my coworkers are still going to drive me crazy, they are still going to be ridiculously demanding, it is still going to give me tummy aches and nose bleeds and coughs.

and another problem is, as i noticed just now while checking idealist for the first time since the summer, is that i don't know what i want to do. i think i might want to work in a college. that seems potentially intellectually stimulating and not completely creatively stifling.

ideas? job opportunities?

also, if i haven't written or called you back in a couple days, i am really sorry and it will happen very soon.
