Yeah.
Question Mark.

I think I need a little time
Sad, the only thing I can do is rhyme
I guess there's some things I'd like to know
So bear with me, and we'll see how it goes.
Was every kiss a lie? Was that all we were?
Did you close your eyes and pretend I was her?
Everyone wants to be the only one
I lied to you, though: I wanted more than fun.
I pretended it was okay to be in second place
But it makes me sad to think I was just a pretty face.
I guess that's all I was; another trophy for your fucking case.
So try to put yourself in my position
While I try to make some strange decisions
"friends" should be a four letter word, with all the damage it's done
& I don't want to hear one more word about how she was the one.
Pathetic, that I still want your affection
But I want to be more than part of a collection
So here's the thing, my flighty friend
Do you want this to be the end?
Me standing here with my heart in my hand,
wishing I still had the strength to stand?
I don't want your pity, and I don't need tact
I just need to know what it was I lacked.
One day you're cold, the next you're a flirt
And it's beginning to kind of (really) hurt.
So tell me what you want; and tell it to me straight, too
You know I'll happily give it-- I always do.
