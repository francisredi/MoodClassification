Huge blow out and its all my fault
I just got in a huge fight w/ Sean and I started it, all b/c I was stressed out. I've been having the best day, now I'm tired and trying to put joni to bed, then jordan wanted something so he can sleep, which is just something to stall going to bed and I tell sean i can't do everything and ask him to get whatever jordan needs, he says he's too tired from working all day to do it, so after i say i can't do everything, he says well u better start, and that just set me off. so i punched him in the leg. I've always been physically abusive, and I know its wrong, but I get so stressed and angry that I feel like I need to release it physically. Oh lord did he have a hissy. He started screaming @ the top of his lungs telling me to get out, not even trying to listen to my appology and why i did it. and he doesnt appologize for what he said and doesnt see anything wrong w/ it. I know what I did was wrong and i cant do anything to take it back, i just wish he would not expect me to do everything around the house w/ the kids. I mean ,they are his kids too...i usually entertain jordan a lot while he's home while he sits on his ass on the computer, im sick of it. Yeah he is the provider, but he's also a father, its not like i sit on my ass all day doing nothing. I'm tired too @ the end of the day, i wish he could see that...he's so closed minded. I'm supposed to be this perfect person who does everything for him, and where he does nothing but work for the family, he thinks thats enough. well us housemakers never get a break, @ least he gets weekends off. where he, guess what, sits on his ass on the computer. I am sick and tired of it. For a time he was good and involved, now he's gone back to his old ways. We've got to share the load. I wish he could see that.
