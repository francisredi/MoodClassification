I thought she was a crow, cause she cried tomorrow, tomorrow.
I think there is something wrong with me lately. I can't seem to have a smile that isn't forced. I can't keep from being moody. I think I'm pushing a lot of the people that are close to me away. I don't even mean to. I don't know why but I think I'm sad. I can't stand the sight of my body in a full length mirror, or protrait sized mirrors for that matter. I keep beating myself up inside. I can't stand a single thing about myself lately. I don't like the way I look, I don't like the way I talk, I just don't like me. I've been eating too much for my liking. But then I have my gut wrenching stomache aches too. This is normally a good sign to cut down on the types of food I've been eating, otherwise I won't be eating at all sooner or later with the way my stomache gets. Strict diets of popcorn and water aren't really my cup of tea. I've had a cold for a while now that I can't seem to shake. I feel so sick in so many different ways. I was standing in the frozen department at work today and I found myself staring at the groceries like they were my worst enemy when I realized I was staring down my own reflection in the door. I wanted to hit the girl staring back at me, that stupid bitch. I really, really don't know what's wrong.&nbsp; But I'm hoping it's nothing. Maybe I'll get to my birthday without everyone thinking I'm nuts. Guys, I'm sorry if I've upset you lately. I don't know what's going on.
All day I've been reciting this song line from a Distillers song it goes like this:
"The testament's a bloody knifeThe rotting meat's the butchers wifeI eat myself stupidI starve myself smartI thought she was a crow Cause she cried tomorrowTomorrow"
guys.....that's me right now. What the hell?
