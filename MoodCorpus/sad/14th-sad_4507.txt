I am so tired, and just feel like everything is completely out of control.

I am still too sick to actually do anything other than sit around and whine, yet I am still the healthy adult in the house and thus feel like utter shit for not doing anything seful today.  We have dishes and laundry and all that piling up. I have courses to get ready for, old genealolgy courses to finish and 18 billion projects to work on or things to clean.

I know lying in bed crying will not help, but just maybe I can cry myself to sleep and actually get some rest and feel like getting a little bit of stuff done for monday.  Cuz, I can tell i sure as hell am not going to do anything else this evening but continue being a grumpy bitch to the people I love.  I totally yelled at Carus for trying to help me play a stupid rpg game, i am such a fucking stupid bitch. I really don't deserve to even have him a round when I just fall apart like this. he deserves better, the girls deserve better and I should be able to do better.  If only I could actually stand for more than 2 minutes without this damn headache and dizzyness.

I really hate how I feel right now.  I hate even more that I direct it out at others when really the only person i am annoyed at and angry with is myself, and to be honest I don't really deserve it either. I caught some damn virus, I got sick.  i should be allowed to be a bit off for a couple days after that.  Yet I just look around this house, and at my kids and the guilt is just so crushing.  

i have to go apoligize to my husband for snapping at him then crawl into bed.  The whole world can just go fuck itself, I am hidding with my soft blanket and hoping it will all go away for a little while. maybe tomorrow I will be a little more ready to deal with it.
