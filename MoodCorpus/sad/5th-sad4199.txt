I know I can't say I am sorry enough!!!
I am sorry to all of you who where worried sick about me! I never meant to worry anyone like that!
So I don't even know how such an amazing night turned into the worst day of my life ever!!! I was so cought up in trying to figure out where me and him stood that I didn't even pay attention to how how it could all end! I fell asleep with my phone on silent, I know that is so not like me!!!  How did this happen, when did I become so stupid? He is a great guy and I am sorry that people worried so much about me that they started to think he was a bad guy! I owe him so much now if I ever get to talk to him again. I am so sorry I don't even know what to say! I am so so sorry!!! Thank you  for all loving me as much as you do! And don't ever worry about me like that! the lord has me in his hands I promise!!! I love you all so so much! I have to go but please know how sorry I am and I would never want anyone to feel like that! I probabley won't be on here for a long time because my mother is so so so so mad at me I can't say I blame her. Bye guys I love you and I am so sorry once again! How could something so stupid turn out to be something so big!!!!
