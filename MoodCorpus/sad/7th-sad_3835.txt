such a lonely day
such a lonely day and its mine; the only song that can describe today.i feel as if everyone has ditched me somehow. i feel as if everyone tells secrets about me.talking bad about me.secrets dont make friends.those little things that are said that tear up something that was truly there.no one is honest anymore.no one is ever there.stephy is at some friends house while i am alone crying invisible tears that no one can see but that i can only feeel.i now know how stephy felt whe ni ditched her for elizabeth.im so sorry.i didnt know myself in those days.i didnt know what i was doing.do u liek them more than me stephy? do u enjoy being with them more than being with me? is there anything ur not telling me?or am i just jumping the gun. did u really ditch me? am i really truly sad becuz u ditched me? those are questions that fil my head right now. i think i now have no real friends. they are just lies and fakes just like life itself.life is just a huge lie.a huge thing that is distorted through everone's eyes.i just want to know how u guys really truly feel about me.dont distort the meanings with words that arent true.to me love no longer exists.i love u guys but do u erally love me?
