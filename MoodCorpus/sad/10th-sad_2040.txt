this is my life
so this is it this is where i lie

things are definately different around me 

I am not really sure what I am doing right now and I don't know what I feel


So I am single now and I am happy and sad but right now I am alone.  VDAY is 2morrow and I am depressed.  it's not like I would have been able to see her or it would have been special but shit I fucking hate this holiday.  I was okay at first but now things are starting to catch up to me and i feel very very lonely.  but i felt lonely when we were together cuz i couldn't see her. the cold hard lesson is that distance is the very enemy of relationships.  especially when you want different things.  at least if we were together we could work on it but the only way for us to be together is if she was here.  

what it boiled down to is that I am a fucking sap and I want a family with the marriage and the kids and all that shit and she doesn't want any of that.  which I know now that she has said that in a couple years I will find out she is getting hitched but whatever.

this was the most mature breakup i have been through so that was something else.  there are no hard feelings just alot of heartbreak.  the good news is that this time i didn't end up in the hospital.  that is an inside joke that the only person who will understand it wont even fucking read this but whatever.

I hate this feeling that my heart is dying.  

well i know i got over keri so i should be able to get over this.

breaking up hurts.... real fucking bad
