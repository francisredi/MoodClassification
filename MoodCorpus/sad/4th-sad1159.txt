fuck your happy new year
well i figure i should write something because im home by myself on new years eve and i havent updated in over a month which is really sad considering how much time i actually spend online.  the last week has been awesome cause tims home and everyone is hanging out and most people seem to be in a good mood.  im usually in a good mood but lately ive been on and off happiness and somewhat depressed every now and then cause im just getting sick of being alone and yeh i know everyone hates being alone but i guess its hitting harder cause its the holidays and i feel like i should be in a good mood and should be sharing the time with someone.  but this is the way its going and i cant control that much.  my dad is really starting to piss me off more and more because everything that happens to me is always my fault and he doesnt care to hear anything i have to say.  this makes me want to move out and i hope i can sometime after this semester and hopefully with some cool people.  another thing that makes me upset is the fact that in a few short months sam will be leaving for his mission and i wont see him in two years which makes 3 of my friends gone and its really sad because i spent the majority of my time since senior year of high school and prior with these guys and ill still be here while they are doing something with themselves.  this is not to say iw ish iw as doing what they are doing cause i know i could never sepnd two years spreading the word of god or whatever you like to believe so good luck to them.  now that i hear the count of the ball dropping from my tv i guess its time for me to end this upset and think of how i wish i had someone to kiss.  oh well goodnight all.
