falling more and more..........
I'm getting so tired of being depressed. I had everyone at work yesterday asking me what was wrong and why I looked so sad. Well let's see I was stuck at work from 2pm until 11pm on Valentine's day. Also seeing all these people coming in there buying stuff for the person they loved didn't help. Valentine's sucks when you don't have anyone to spend it with. But I can't complain because a friend did buy me a dozen roses. He was suppose to eat lunch with me but something came up and he couldn't make it so he felt bad. Later that night he came in with those and all was forgiven. My mom bought me some green roses. Those rocked so much. 


Just got in from visiting my grandfather. He's doing so much better.I'm do proud of him. He's walking on his own now and getting in and out of bed. So things are looking up for him. But even if he gets out of there he still won't be able to stay by himself. One because he doesn't have a house. We had to give it up because we couldn't afford to keep paying for it and two because we are afraid to leave him by himself because he might fall again. So if he does get out he'll more than likely come stay with us.
