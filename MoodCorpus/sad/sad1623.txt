Grand  Central Station
I've got to complement the National Geographic Channel on their excellent program "Inside Grand Central Station"  a 2 hour show that aired this evening.  It was very well put together.  It did go into the many features of the Worlds largest railroad station with it's 44 Platforms with 67 tracks along them on two levels with hundreds of miles of rails below it.  Grand Central is a Engineering Marvel built in early 1900.  The best thing about this show wasn't all the neat old underground tracks, controls, old heavy weight cars, secret tunnels, and hiden secrets; but was the actual story of it's life and how it managed to survive to today after facing many many many  threats against it's existance through out time.  The way the story was told of it's life was excellent. It seriously brings a tear to your eye watching it.  It's extremly sad how peole are always trying to distroy history and historic things to make way for development and money.   It's sad to see the two ugly buildings that are in place of the once standing Penn. Station that had much better architecture in it and looked like it was built by the Romains

I miss taking the train in and out of Grand Central Station.
I've been in Grand Central Station many times from the 1980's to up through 2000.  I've seen it's dirty decrepit state and threat of extinction back in the 80's (the way Penn Station went) to it's new renovation through today. Compared to back in the day G.C. opened, it is now recieving the look it did back then.
