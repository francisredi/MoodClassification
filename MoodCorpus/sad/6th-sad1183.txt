Breaking again...
Every day just seems so up/down.  I keep thinking that I'm beginning to pull things together, and then everything slips out of my grasp again.  At least publicly I think I've kept on a happy face today.  I know you aren't supposed to be fake with people, but then again you aren't supposed to be nothing but sad and unfairly leaning on them either.

Anyway, I can't even tell what kind of sad I am now.  Am I depression sad, and this will go away as quickly as it started?  Or am I break up sad, because I miss Kenny?  Argh, the Kenny issue is confusing to classify but I miss Kenny the way I knew him pre-depression.  It's really sad, but I'm entirely convinced its true, but my depression has ruined our friendship.  By ruined, I think I mean temporarily ruined.  I'm hoping that as the depression lifts, everything else will fix itself.  The thing is I can't help but wonder if this time things WON'T go back to normal.  Maybe this time the wounds are too deep to properly heal, too infectious that only nasty scars will remain.  I'm afraid that maybe forever he'll consider me his friend, even good friend, but we won't be close like we used to.  I don't want to lose that, but then again, it's already been lost.  And it's been lost for a bit now.  As I've said before, December was HELL.  And last night somehow became more of the same, etc.

Okay, as I babble on and on about stuff it's becoming more and more clear that this is a S.A.D. issue rather than a break up issue.  Surprise surprise.
