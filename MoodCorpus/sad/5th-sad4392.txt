"I'll go anyway, I'll go anyway, they won't refund the ticket"
Damn you.  
I don't see you so I sit here being bored.
And missing you increases the miserableness of boredom.

Today basically involved Queer as Folk, too much food, refunding glasses at Lenscrafters, and selling tickets for "Hair" over the phone.  Please, please, please come see it.  I've been working on this for eight months and it'll be awful if no one shows up.

I've realized that I hate hate hate having nothing to do.  Today was my day off from rehearsals and I had no one to hang out with so I just chilled at home.  I keep myself as busy as possible, and always have, but I don't know what I'm doing.  Yes, I love doing everything that I do but I don't understand why I'm so afraid of having nothing to do.  It's like I'm afraid to stop and be alone with my thoughts.  I'm not even sure of what will make me happy anymore.

I looked at a calendar and realized I'm leaving in about twelve weeks.  Twelve weeks!  What am I going to do...I kept pushing the date up, and thinking "Do I really want to go?"  "Of course I want to go.  That's what I do."  "But why?"  There's so many reasons I want to stay, but there's so many reasons I'd hate myself if I didn't go.

I keep having these dreams where I do really stupid things and regret it and feel upset and so sorry for hurting people I love.

Guh, what a stupid mess.  I'm sorry everyone that you had to know like this.
