I'm such a fat failure,I keep screwing up,and screwing up,and screwing up and,I can't fucking stop messing up.I ate two big packs of crackers 120,plus a bottle of Crystal Light,125,And cracker dip stuff,about 200 or 300 ish today.This sucks,I've got to get my ass in gear,and I have got to stop screwing up.I can't keep messing up,It's almost summer,and I refuse to be fat when June and July rolls around.Yuck.I am going to work out so hard tonight and Friday,then barely eat Saturday,Sunday,And Monday,seeing that I don't have to go to school Monday.Yuck yuck yuck.I MUST get myself back in gear,and get my control back.I have to or i'm going to be purging again.Ugh!,I need to fast again,and actually stick to it.Gah.I'm doing a 42 hour fast,another attempt again starting right now.Then i'll have a can of fruit when I end it,I've got to get my control back,right now.I NEED to lose about 15 lbs,like really fucking fast.I don't know why the hell i've gotten so bad at this,I used to be able to lose 15 lbs,10 lbs,5 lbs in 2 weeks.Now,it's taking FOREVER!!!,I HATE my body at this point.The fat is coming right back,and I have got to fucking stop it,NOW.

This screwing up,and eating like a fat hog will stop right now.Today.I'll have a bottle of Crystal Light or something when I get back from the gym,and that's it.I've got to stop having late night fucking little binges,and binging after school,and just eating tons of food until i'm full in general.It will stop.It WILL.
