Not sure
Have been depressed all day today and not sure why.  Well not sure depressed is the word more like feeling "out of it" Kinda sad.  

Cheered up a bit in the evening when daughter and I put up our Christmas tree although even that made me a bit sad as well.  Remembering the days when it was a family event to put it up when the kids were small.  Having the Christmas music playing, taking video's as we did it.  Just really a family thing and now all there is to do it is my youngest and I and it seemed more like a chore then anything.  Even she felt it and called her sister to tell her that she needed to come over and help as it was just too depressing as she felt like an only child from a single parent family.  However, her sister and boyfriend were doing something so her sister said she'd come over as soon as they were done but by the time they were we had the tree almost done and were feeling better so my youngest called her sister and told her not to worry about it.  

I know I've been having some odd dreams the last few nights and I think this is what has me feeling this way but for the life of me I don't know what the dreams have been about.  I know sounds odd but what can I say.

Anyway, guess I'll go
