Leave me alone, I'm lonely! 
Okay, I have been listening to nothing but Pink's new album lately. It seriously rocks my socks! 
Squee! IMO, stupid girls isn't even the best single on the album and I loved it since I first listened to it. 

School is just crazy lately. We've been writing so many tests and there's so many stuff to prepare for clsses, papers to write and tons of homework. But right now, I'm free. It's easter vacation! 
Which totally rocks! Although that I don't know what to do. I mean I have no boyfriend to meet and most of my friends are gone to Austrich or something. sucky. 
So I'm wondering why nothing's going on lately on the internet. It's like everything dead. 
Well,... time to look for internet friends!! 

I'm so bored out of my mind that I'm randomly downloading things and movies to watch. I've downloaded the Ice princess with Michelle Trachtenberg and Wedding Crasher with Rachel McAdams. Now I already watched Ice princess and I have to admit I liked it!!! 
I didn't think I would, but me being my usual fan girly self it's not that surprising. 

I'm getting more and more into HP these days. I think I'm gonna watch all the movies in a row or something later...
