FROG BLAST THE VENT CORES
There needs to be more hours in a day.  Time just does not understand me.  I have far too much to do!  There are new bands to listen to, new perfumes to sniff, new hairstyles to experiment with, new subjects to bitch about.  24 hours a day is far too little to accomplish all of my grandoise schemes.  They should have closed work today.  I could have used the time, and it was far too dangerous to travel outside anyhow.  I almost fell three times, and once i stepped in a puddle of dirty icewater practically up to my knees.  I should not be expected to work in these atrocious conditions!  My very well-being is being threatened by some corporate stooges who do not understand that my life is bad enough, being a dark abyss and all.

And then my emo girlfriend wants me to get her flowers.  I stepped out of my dorm this morning and I didn't see any damn flowers growing anywhere, so shes just plain screwed.  I don't have any money after I spent it all at hot topic, so I certainly can't be expected to buy her anything.  If she wants chocolates she can bake them herself, girls belong in the kitchen anyway I have no idea what shes doing trying to get a comp sci degree.  Shes probably giving all her professors handjobs under the table just to pass her classes.  It'd make sense anyway, im sure shes cheating on me, why should anything good happen to me?  I treat her with love and respect, and she just pisses all over it.
