Different
The other day I realized that what happened to me has made me different.  I use to just go about my life freely and now everytime I turn a corner I'm afraid that something will happen.  I'm at the point where I don't like to be out after dark.  

It makes it hard for my friends and I to do things when I don't want to be out after the sun goes down.  I'll go out if I'm with others, but not in a situation where they want me to mee them some where.  Heck no!!

Speaking of friends I only really have one left.  The other one sold me out for some guy she's screwing.  Her and I were suppose to be really close and wonderful friends, but as soon as some dude came along she left me in the dust.  I'd be happy for her if she wasn't putting him before her daughter.  

My life mainly consist of work and taking naps.  I'm 21 years old and I spend my days in napville.  What the heck?  Hmm the sleep is pretty nice if I do say so myself.  The other day I slept from 8pm-3am.  Good sleep, but the bad part is that I was up from 3am-about 6pm.  6pm is when I took another nap.  

Maybe I take naps so that I will not be sad about how depressing my life has become.  Often times I feel like I'm fading away.  That there isn't much of the old me left.  I even wonder if anyone notices that I've changed or if they just see a shell of me and not the real me.  

In my next journal I'll talk about Ohayocon 2006!!!  It freaking rocked.
