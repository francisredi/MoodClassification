The Long Drive Home
Do you ever hang out with some people but yet you feel alone?  That happened to me tonight when I went with some people from my Bible Study group to see, "The Chronicles of Narnia."  Excellent movie by the way.  Anyways, so often with them I feel like the one who tags along and is shut out of the conversation.  And I know it is my own fault.  I just feel like I often can't relate to them when they talk about certain things.  I understand that my life has been different than many of them but it almost feels ridiculous at times.  These are some really nice and welcoming people, but yet I feel stunted by my own lack of confidence or what not.  It's really frustrating for me but I can't seem to figure out how to solve this.  I lack the charisma or something.  A lot of them have that youthfulness and excitement that I lost so long ago.  It's something I would really like to recapture but it might be one of those things that you lose forever once it's gone.

I feel consumed in my own frustration to overcome my loneliness.  It has been harder than I had anticipated to make friends and find people with whom I can spend time.  I know that I am the one at fault here.  I keep telling myself to open up more but yet I can't seem to shake that stigma and just do it.  Opening up has had good results in the past but for some reason, I have crawled back into my pathetic little shell and won't come out.  Maybe I am afraid of how I will be judged.  Maybe I'll be seen as a fraud in some respect.  Maybe I'm just being a complete idiot.  Whatever it is, I want to find the answer and become a better, happier person.
