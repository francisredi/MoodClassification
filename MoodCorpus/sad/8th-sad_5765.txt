Ok, I'm really getting nervous now....
For the past week, as anybody in school can tell you, I have been majorly, majorly sick. 
It started out two weeks ago, when I stayed home from school because I felt like I was really coming down with something. Felt better the next day so I went.
The next monday I began to feel really tired and my lymph nodes all over my neck were beginning to hurt. A lot. They were so inflammed I had trouble breathing.
So then I stay home on tuesday, go back on wednesday. We had gone monday night to see if it was mono. Turns out it wasn't. Now I'm really worried. So then I go on thursday, only because my mom is pissed that I'm sick (explanation later). I come home and I feel like shit. I go back to the doctor and she gives me antibiotics. Then I stay home on friday because I'm now to the point where I am completely sick out of my mind. Saturday, yesterday, the swelling begins to go down. They arent painful anymore, but they are there and annoying. On top of that I can not eat what so ever. I forced myself to have some chex mix because my stomach was really starting to hurt. I had extreme nausea and was living off of pepsi and coke. I'm not hungry, at all. I have a feelign like I'm full.
I really need help. I'm trying to work up the courage to tell my parents and my doctor that I think I found an indicator of cancer. But I feel so afraid and embarassed. Jesus. I need help.
