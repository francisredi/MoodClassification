The children came around today which was lovely. I can't believe  how quickly they are growing.  Luke gave me lots of huggles as did Cate. We played for a bit and they both drew and painted. We went walked to the shops and Cate and I played tag all the way.  Laughed none stop as always - Luke included.  Only crashed his buggy a few times. I don't think he noticed but Madam liked to keep track!! lol

Took my share of the joint bank account today.  Couldn't be bothered to tell dic-dude about it as he is ignoring the odd text I send him.  Can only think that things between him and FT are hotting up.  Used just over 300 pounds to buy myself some jewellry as I can't keep wearing the set that he bought me.  Bought diamonds instead of ruby and it was the first set of 'grown up' jewellry I have ever bought.  It's a really pretty set, very delicate which suits my bone structure perfectly. Got a hundred left which I might blow on something else.  Maybe something from Monsoon and Lush because he hated me shopping there. Maybe I will just bank it.  I'm bang on target so I could have a final 'eff him' splurge.

It's Selina's birthday party tomorrow.  Need to buy her a gift.  I simply do not know where the year has gone.  It only seems like yesterday when we were celebrating her arrival into the world.

Have to write my resignation letter also.

Feel a bit down in the dumps cos its almost valentines day and it makes me feel like a failure.   Last year, I promised myself not to celebrate alone and I didn't (Mr B) and this year?? Well .... ohhh I'm fed up!!!!!!!!!! I shall survive!!! I just have to keep repeating that.  Worked for Gloria Gaynor and it shall for me!
