Something is going on here........
Something is fucked up with this site today, cause like nothing is working. Anyways, whatever.
I NEED A HAIRCUT! AND I NEED HELP FINDING A REALLY GOOD ONE! HELP ME PLEASE, SOMEONE!
So my birthday is next week and I'd like to cut my hair off by then and then fuck up my beautiful color real good. Fuck it all, I'm having a major break down but it's fucking hilarious because I all the sudden hate my hair and everyone I see on a regular basis, I watch the Style network all day long and then decide to sell all my clothes on ebay for $5, I have become clostrophobic and I think maybe even schitzophrenic, I am obsessed with dirt and germs and Invader Zim, not to mention checking my email once every hour or less, most of it's probably in my head and I just need to leave the house, but if I leave the property there's people that I don't feel comfortable around, so I only leave to go to the bar, which only happens once a week, so I probably only have cabin fever, still I've gotten really good at typing with one finger, on the down side I think my house is trying to murder me, don't ask me why, I think this would all go away if someone just stood up and demanded I be given medication and professional help, or that I leave the house more often, or maybe, just maybe someone should go find me some mushromms or some shit. Goddamn.
