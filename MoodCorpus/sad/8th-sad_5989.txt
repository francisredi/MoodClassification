im not good with being mad. i think i honestly dont know what to do with myself when i am mad. i battled an attitude problem back in jr. high and high school and i think i over came it and really know how to check my attitude now. i've always tried to be the sweet girl, im polite, always caring of other people's feelings. so when i get mad it only lasts for perhpas 5 minutes and then it turns into me being completely sad until it's resolved... and if it doesnt get resolved within hours then it leads to depression and me blaming myself for the problem. and im sitting here thinking, why? why do i always end up thinking it's my fault? 
i cant stand being mad, upset and or sad.. i cant stand it! i drive myself crazy until im happy again. and if it doesnt happen then i deteriorate..
most of the time if i get mad at some stranger i could care less i guess. but when it's someone close, i seriously cant stand it. i hate the way of living when it's with someone i really care about. 
i still rememeber being in a fight with antonio, it literally killed me inside everyday that we were mad at each other and not getting along. i care and love him way too much that it bothered me so.
this is what happens everytime this happens.
im so confused i dont get it. it's out of no where avoidance.. and it makes me feel so pathetic to feel like this. I should be the one mad and ignoring your calls and texts.. I should be the one making you crazy and crying yourself to sleep... I should be the one making you feel dead inside until i reasure you...
