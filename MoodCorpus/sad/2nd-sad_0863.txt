Slap me and call me stupid. 
Everyone is leaving. Maybe it just hit me today. Maybe I just long for so much that I cant have that it hurts. Why does everyone have to leave? Why do I have to be in a place that makes me miserable? Why cant I have self motivation? Maybe Im just jealous that everyone is getting away from here, away from the depression that sinks in when you live here. In a place where people need to take smoke and drink to get away from here, thats why crime and drugs here is so big, you need it just to get through the day. When I was in New York I didnt need it. Not at all. You feed off the city's energy. This place just sucks everything that is you, out of you. And do you know why Rockford is the way it is? The christian conservatives that run this city. This place could be so much better. It really could, but since they wont let us have anything good this place has gone to shit. Maybe someday I will meet a handsome rich perfect gentleman who will just sweep me off my feet and make me forget about all the bullshit in the world. Until then I think I will just have to live with it. What I want to know is why I cant stop crying. I was supposed to go to Matts tonight for his going away party. I dont want him to go away. I am sick, well not really anymore, but I had a sore throat earlier and so I didnt go. Now no one is going I guess, I feel really bad. I want to go, I really do, but I dont want to say goodbye. My other friend Andy is moving to Texas, Brandon is going to Colombia, Ryan left today for Schaumberg, and I just dont want them to leave. AND I CANT FUCKING STOP CRYING. I am really going to miss Matt so so much. Like sooo much. I think I miss New York so much too, and my sister and her husband soo much too. Make me stop right now. Slap me and call me stupid. Im done.
