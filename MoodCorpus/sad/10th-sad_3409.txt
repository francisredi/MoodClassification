It's official!!! Valentine's day is the most depressing holiday of them all! Alright, STOP READING right now for your own good, just a bunch of rambling teen angst, this is mainly for me to vent. So ignore this post. Anywho, Nick is starting to get changing feelings about me, I've been a tard and cried all day, I have so much homework, my parents wouldn't let me see nick today and instead made me go eat dinner with them and get snowboard stuff, I'll be gone all break so therefore won't get to see anyone becuase I'll be in canada with people I don't like, I'm stressed as hell, My parents are ruining me and making me feel like FAT horrid incompetent bad worthless child, Everything seems to be my fault lately, I ate a whole box of chocolate to make me feel better plus some more crap so there goes a few more pounds gained, FAT, Behind in homework and grades going to shit, I fucking suck at guitar and feel stupid in class, nothing is going right and everything is going to shit, failure!!!

Ooh the drama. Yes, indeed. Tommrow better be a friggin snowday or ima gonna scream. I would like to have a snowday and then spend the whole day playing in the snow with Tori and drinking hot cocoa with little marshmellows. Keep your fingers crossed.
