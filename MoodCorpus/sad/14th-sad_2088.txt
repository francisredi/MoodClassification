Understand
Well I have come to understand that I don't understand anything lol
Well I don't understand a lot of things but I must some right? Or be at least close to understanding?

Well I have thought people just wanted to hurt me like everyone I have some pretty huge trust problems I would like to blame it all on my past but I don't know if it's anyones fault but my own.

Everytime I think it's safe for me to be open with someone I always end up hurt. So I guess because of letting myself open up to ex's and such that I have helped make my wall even higher and stronger.

One of my biggest fears is never knowing what it feels like to be loved. I want to have someone so bad that I would give up everything just to have even a chance at it even if it was for one day. I don't want to die alone or die with never knowing what it's like to have someone. 

Everyone has been in love had it or whatever in there life. I don't understand why it seems like im not ment to. Maybe im not who knows even if im not supose to I don't think it's going to stop me from wanting it.

Im my own worst enemy I keep blamen people for hurting me but I do most of it to myself. Till I can just not care and be myself and open up to people and not always try to hide im going to be a very lonely sad little girl. Im sick of trying to be everything everyone wants.

Im not sure I know who I am anymore. Maybe I never really knew I was always trying to be what everyone else wanted me to be. I gave up trying to be happy myself to try to make everyone else happy. But I was never good enough to make anyone happy. 

Everytime I think I have found the answer to one of my questions like 10 more arise. Can't seem to win lol...

Well I guess im done blabben on I feel better now ^-^
Now if only Jason or David would get on =[
