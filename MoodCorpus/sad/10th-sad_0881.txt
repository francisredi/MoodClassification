Lately, I've felt like I'm just killing days. Don't get me wrong, I'm having fun and all. I don't know how to describe it. There isn't any purpose to it all, I suppose is the problem. Where is my drive? Where is my motivation? I'm not just talking about school here. I'm talking about EVERYTHING. Every little thing. Maybe I'm just not doing what I want to be doing. So what do I like doing? Here's the thing- I don't know. 

I like crossing the days off of the calander, for example. I mean I REALLY like doing that. It is what I look forward to, its almost as if I'm crossing it out and in my mind thinking, "yes another one of these are over!!!!" I'm not counting down to particular day either. I don't feel unhappy, I just feel bored. I guess that's the emotion, for lack of a better word. So I asked myself, am i doing things when i would rather be doing something else? That's just it, what else is there to do? Is there something that I like but, I'm not doing it so therefore I'm unhappy. I don't get it. But as I said before I think that's just it. I really feel like I have no purpose to anything that I'm doing. I'm just crossing off days, waiting for the next one to be over with. What kind of a person does this? :(
