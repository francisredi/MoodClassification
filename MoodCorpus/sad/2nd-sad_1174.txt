Blah
It is so hard to work out on Mondays. I went home from work, got all dressed to go, went to the store...and came back hom :( After walking around BJ's for an hour, I didn't much feel like working out. I'm sick today, but I -have- to go. I'm better than I was. Every other day is better than twice a week. Baby steps. 

I'm finding it difficult to get my nutrition numbers where they need to be. I'm always over on my fat, and under on my protein and calories. Carbs are fine. I guess I need to take baby steps here too. One thing is under contrtol, now to work on the next one. I don't worry too much if I go over on my calories, because I'm under so often that it doesn't matter. I can burn off calories, no problem. I need to get my protein up though. And I want to do it in more ways than just drinking a shake. Sure, you get 50 grams of protein from a shake, but I feel like I should be getting more elsewhere. Therein lies my problem. In order to get protein from other foods, I have to take in more carbs and fat. I really just need to plan my meals better, I guess. Anyone have suggestions?
