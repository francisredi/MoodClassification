i was to depressed to go to school today.+ i was sick. i cried myself to sleep last night like a little emo kid would do .. i don't like this feeling. i don't like feeling worthless to myself. but once someone comes around i put on a big smile and act like my life is cool. but it really isnt. rachael said she is worried about me so we will be seeing eachother more offten. tomorrow is tibors funeral. i am once again scared shitless of the thought. i have to take matt, nathan,stefan, and janelle with me. i don't even know janelle ... but whatever. shes prolly just gonna be there for matt and stuff. me and hi have grown pretty close. hes my little bi buddy. we like  sending pics of emo boys kissing and saying how cute it is. lol. he to is having a hard time realizing tibor is gone. i never thought it would happen. my mom and i were looking through our box of pictures and we found a few of him. i wanted to cry but nothing came out. he had these beautiful blue green eyes, they constantly  flash in my head. i feel  so shity riht now. :[ 
i have made a promise to  myself today no matter how shitty things get i will never let go and totally give  up. i am scared shitless for the furture, and sometimes i don't want to live it. i  don't want the pressure of having to get a job, a house, a husband or wife, and have kids and take crae of them. it all seems like so much. but im sure it'll be exciting. or at least i hope
