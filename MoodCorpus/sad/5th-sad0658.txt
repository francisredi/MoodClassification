Lazy
Alright, so I really should update this more often since I went to the bother of creating it.  

Holidays went okay.  I flew home on the 22nd (an all day adventure with not too many setbacks).  My brother picked me up at the airport and we didn't get lost on the way back to the house.  Go Us!  Christmas was nice.  Smaller than usual with my parents sinking all their available money into the dealership. Mostly clothes.  Day after Christmas, me, my mom, my sis and brother all drove up to Georgetown, Ont to visit my uncles Don and Dave and Dave's wife Suzanne (who is currently dying of leukemia, but that's another story).  Day after that we drove up to the chalet in Collingwood.  My grandmother doesn't look very good.  She's sick with a bunch of stuff and has osteoperosis so bad she's basically looking at her belly button all the time.  Can't really get up stairs anymore.  And the chalet wasn't built with an invalid in mind.  

After one morning of skiing (damn you rain!), not much else happened.  On the 30th, we drove back to Georgetown to have dinner and spend the night at Don's, and drove back to NH the next day.  

The rest of my vacation was pretty boring.  The plane rides back were not fun.  I took a sick day after to recover.  Blah blah.  

I think the most lasting thing I took from this "vacation" is a sort of lingering depression.  I'm hoping it won't blow up into anything nastier.  I really don't need that right now.  So currently my apartment is a mess, I have no available cash for fun things (although all my bills are paid for and whatnot).  Blah.  Hopefully next post will be timely and happier.  :-/
