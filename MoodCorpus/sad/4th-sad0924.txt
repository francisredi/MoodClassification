I feel like such a loser.
I've made 20 journal entries at least today alone about what's been happening... then 2 seconds later i change my mind and i don't want them up any more. here it is new years eve i should be out happy and filled with joy over all the things i ahve to be thankful for, i should be with a special someone looking into their eyes smiling and saying "we're together FINALLY". Instead i'm at home so scared and depressed i can barely work up the nerve to shower.i was staring at my bottle of pain killers left over from a surgery i had thinking "why don't i just leave".i threw it away and came here to type yet again to keep from looking at the bottle, i'm to much of a wuss to carry it out any how.


 All i know is i'd give anything for somebody to tell me i'll be ok. i keep trying to tell myself that but reality keeps telling my gut differently. this is the absolute worse holiday season i have ever had. i don't think anyone else in world life sucks as much as mine does right now. i won't even be able to call any of my friends til moneday... i called my one best friend, karen. she had her grandson over i could hear him screaming in the background lol i started to tell her the even more bad news i found out today but i didn't have the heart. i just said i'd called to wish her happy news and tried to keep from crying.


 I could put myself out of misery if i had to guts to, but since i don't maybe the pain will just make me fall over maybe my heart will just say "enough" and quit beating. i have no life left in me at all and no tears left to cry with either.
