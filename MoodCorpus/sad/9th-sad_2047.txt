Valentine's Day is the bane of my exsistance. Really.

I feel terribly ugly and lonley. Everytime I look in the mirror I want to cry. 
I am so bored with my independent studies. I feel very alone every morning and the library is slowly destroying my brain. I need to do something, but if I switch into show choir it will kill me even more because that whole class is filled with generic "pretty" little blond things with plaster smiles.  
"Buy a rose for your Sweetheart" signs are taunting me at every corner. I judge that the world is staging a coup to evict from office what little self esteem I have. The problem is I learned recently that the only way to be noticably beautiful is to know that you are beautiful. Failing on that account. yep. 
At least my creativity is sorta-kinda going. To get through the day I makeup elaborate stories and dramas. They are very hollow, though, in that I know I create them to make myself happier. 

*sigh* 
Another day of sameness
Anti-individuality 
Running through my veins,
Selfesteem constantly 
in incompassonate decay.
It's so funny how
Beautiful women know
they are nothing more 
than ugly girls 
on any given day.

Hey, atleast I sortakinda can pull-off the poetry. lol.
