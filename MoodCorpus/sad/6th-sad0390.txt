I just have to vent!!
I'm having a really hard time right now and I hope it's just a phase--- maybe I just need to vent.  Overall I'm doing okay and you will hear me speak of good times and be all smiles, but lately I'm not doing well.  I am dissatisfied with my life and don't know what to do.  I feel like people I used to talk to all the time are drifting away, you know, old friends I kept in touch with over the years, and the only female friend I actually talk to is Bella, but even then we don't talk nearly enough!!  It makes me feel lonely.  I was hoping to make new friends at work, but it's not happening the way I want it to.  I don't model anymore, I don't think I've had a photo shoot in two months, and there's rarely an appealing job offer up here.  Companies and websites I apply to do not return my messages, the only ones who are interested in me are the ones I don't want to work for. I feel like my male friends, or so-called male friends, have begun to exit my life as the relationship with my boyfriend gets longer and longer (hrrm... that makes me wonder).  Life as an internet/nude model is growing less and less appealing by the week.  I get fed up with the disgusting offers, the lame emails, and the oftentimes crude notes received by girlfriends and wives of people who look at my photos who think I'm there to steal their man or some bullshit like that.  And what's with the wives of PHOTOGRAPHERS emailing me to find out if I fucked their husband during a photo shoot?!!  How unprofessional and degrading is that!!??

And on top of that, I'm just lonely.  And when I get lonely I pretty much go crazy.  I'm 500 miles from my boyfriend, 600 miles from my best friend, I'm having a hard time making girl friends up here and if I try to make friends with a guy it is frowned upon by my boyfriend.  

I'm sorry guys, I know this sounds horrible.  I'm having a bad day.  :(
