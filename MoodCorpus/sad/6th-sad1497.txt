Why?
True story:  A group of young men head into the Boundry Waters to party.  They canoe in through Loon Lake (the lake at which my dad runs the mechanical portage).  They camp some where on Lac La Croix on the Canadian side.  It is dark and they are all sitting round the camp fire tossing back beers.  All of them are underaged.  One gets up to relieve himself and on the way to his destination he slips and hits his head.  After quite some time with out his presence at the camp fire the others go to find him.  They discover him, laying on his back unable to move himself.  Figuring he had "one-too-many" they thoughtfully put him in the tent and lay him on his side so as he doesn't drown in his own puke.  They soon retire for the night.  Awaking in the morning they find that they cannot rouse thier friend.  He is dead.  One of them has a radio with and calls for help.  The U.S. athorities arrive later in the day, but since the incident happend in Canada the Royal Mounted Division is also present.  The body and the boys cannot go home untill they have explained everything to the Canadian Mounties.  After flying around Canada and then back home, the boys go to the funeral of thier friend which is held a few days after they body is shipped home.  After the funeral what do you suppose they did?  They held another party and got smashed AGAIN.  Because that's what the deceased would have wanted.......  If you ask me I think the young man that died would have something else to say about it, but why would anyone think?  Why should they when they are young and have thier whole lives ahead of them to be serious?  The above is why... their WHOLE lives may come to an end from ONE party. 

The doctor said that when the man slipped he hit the base of his skull on a rock which caused the vessels in his brain and surrounding spinal area to burst, even if they had rushed him out there would have been nothing they could have done to save him.  

Such a waste.
