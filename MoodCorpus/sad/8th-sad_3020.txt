i lost a few of my marbles today and decided to listen to stupid songs i havent listened for a long time, like Letters To You by Finch, Memory by Sugarcult and What Went Wrong by Blink182. and then got so frustrated that i went to the gym to run everything out [does that make sense?]. and now i feel so drained i cant possibly do maclaurin's series chapter in the tys like i meant to. bah.
there is some nice nice white and green roxy bag that some girl in school has.. and it TOTALLY matches my uniform.. and so liming and i scouted j8 for it today (we're damn sure it comes from a&nbsp;pushcart there) and cursed like anything coz the stupid pushcart moved to the highest floor. anyhow we went up, but the stupid thing was out of stock. and the aunty who was eating a yummy-smelling seafood pasta complete with mussels and all sorts of shellfish which i cant stand said that they're not bringing in new stock anymore. more curses i tell u. so now we're planning a trip to far east or bugis to hunt that thing down. hopefully by the time we find it that girl wont use it anymore. =D&nbsp; 
my thigh muscles hurt. my head hurts. my heart hurts.
