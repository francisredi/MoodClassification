Navigation-skills got lost with the fading light
I watch movies where people fall in love, read books where they fall in love, watch as my friends fall in love. I see this and all I can think is "I want that!" Why dont I get that? I mean I'm happy for them all. But, why doesnt it happen to me? I could see things happening with megan, but nothing will. Why? Cause I joined the Navy. And I have to move in 3 weeks. Nothing will happen in Virginia either. Why? Cause I'll be moving in 6 months. Next duty station: nothing. I'll be out to sea. So pretty much I just fucked myself over for the next 6 years. I've got to accept that. But I cant, I never have. 

Wouldn't that be one of the greatest feelings ever? Knowing that as I'm out to sea, that there is someone back home, waiting, worrying, wishing, writing me letters. Someone who will be on the pier waiting as I come off the ship. Someone who, when were pulling into port I'm at the lifelines, leaning forward trying to pick her out of the crowd. Searching the pier and practically jumping off ship when I spot her. Who wouldnt want that? 

I dont understand why I want to be in a relationship so much. I mean its not like I have a great track record with relationships. I have a great family who loves me. I have the best friends (who are part of my family) anyone could ask for. They love me and I love them. So why do I still need this? Different type of love I guess. 

I give up. I should be happy with what I have.

But I'm not.
