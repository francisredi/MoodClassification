just need my own friends
hey yall. whats up? :) i just got done reading my past entries. its so funny when i read entries from like mon-wed cause they are always so depressing. but then i go to destiny on thursdays and im fine for like fri, sat, and sun. lol i wish i could go to destiny on tuesdays. i could go to that life church thing but keila doesnt go there much anymore. so.. oh yea april is starting to get on my nerves. i cant stand her. i'll just tell you straight up I CANT STAND HER! i hope she doesnt read this. actually i do so she can see how she is making me feel. ok let me tell you some things she does. well like a week ago me and keila and april were all walking down the hall. i was standing behind them (3rd wheel) like i usually do. well i walked to class. later on that day i saw keila with a keychain that said "buds" on it. i asked her where she got it and she said april gave it to her after i left cause april didnt want to make me mad. gah thats so stupid. i mean if she likes keila better then whatever... but she doesnt have to be sneaky and crap. ugh.. and today she was talking to keila and she was saying that they could go to the prom together, just them two. that made me mad too. wouldnt it make you? i mean shes pretty much saying "i like keila better and kayla is stupid and i dont like her." thats what shes saying. i need my own friends. but the only people that want to be my friends is heather (who is so obsessed with guys i cant even have a real conversation with her), chris lyle ( who is so stupid and horny he wants to be with me its not even funny), and like thats it. i guess theres zach and patrick but they aren't really like best friend, tell all your secret to, go to the movies with type of friends. you know? im just getting sick of being lonely thats all. being lonely for 11 years can sure take a toll on a girl. guess i got to go. i'll try to write as often as i can. see ya round! :)
