Insomnia
Life is a sad, sad story. You have to work hard, you make many burdens, you are tortured by discrimination and always being judged. People look at you and only see the outside. People talk to you and only tell you lies. My life is like many others, my heart is broken like many others. Yes, I'm hypocritical, yes, I lie, yes, I'm no one in particular, and yes, I'm not at all happy. Life isn't what I thought it up to be, life isn't grand, its not perfect, its not small. My world, my dreams, my every thought, all broken into fragments. Pieces I dare not put together. Things that I never want to touch, again. Its all in the past, fading, but, it always comes around to it. It always has to be brought up again. The fact of the matter is, I'm afraid. I've started to laugh hysterically, purely out of boredom. But only to realize, my future is what laughs at me. My unknown future. Mocking me with its whims and fever. It knows what I don't, it sees what I want but don't try. I look over to procrastinate. I talk as if I know, hoping to be wrong. I can't say that I'm alone, but I feel like its a one person show, and I'm all there is.

Every time I talk, or say a word to that one person, I realize, how sad and lonely I am. How pathetic, and how much in denial. Thats when I know, when I wish I hadn't screwed up my life.

This time, I laughed out of random gain, and wanted to cry out for solace from this pain in my heart. But my eyes couldn't see, and thats how I knew, I fell asleep, drowning in my false life.
