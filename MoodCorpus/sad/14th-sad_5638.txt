Why?
Don't you all find it depressing as hell that most college kids thoughts wonder one of 2 or 3 things.  They are:
1) When am I going to drink next?
2) Where am I going to drink when I drink next?
and 
3) Who would make out with me/fuck me when I'm drunk next?  or now... or ever?!?!?????

I was just poking around on Facebook which, for those who don't know or aren't on it, it's this big sorta online yearbook that can constantly be updated with new pictures of people getting drunk and looking like idiots.  It's just so sad to me to look that these kids that I went to high school and see them in pictures taken in basements and shabby dorm rooms, doing nothing but chugging beer and slowly, but steadily, getting fat.  How is this the beginning of your future?  Why are you drinking so much?  Don't misinterpret this to mean that I hate and do not drink, because I do every now and then.  But why is that the highlight of so many people's lives?  I just don't get it.  It depresses me and I just...I'm really glad I got out of Wisconsin.  I think that, had I stayed, I would end up like those kids in the pictures I now pity.  Yeah, you all have drinking buddies, but who cares when nobody can remember what you all did together for the past 4 years?

Sorry...I'll step down off my soapbox now.
