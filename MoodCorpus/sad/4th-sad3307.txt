Feeling...
Why? I'm really not understanding why I am feeling the way that I am... I feel... alone.  Baby, if you're reading this, it's not anything you've done.. I don't know, it's just a feeling I have.  As much as I hate all the work that comes with school, I also hate this sitting at home everyday by myself, bored to death. I hate not having anything to do, or anyone to hang out with. I need to get these Observation Hours done, but the school hasn't gotten back to me yet.. I need to get my schedule fixed since they were nice enough to change it without my permission, but I haven't gotten that done either.  Is it possible for me to go a semester in the education department without something getting effed up?? I cannot wait to marry tony.. I love him more than I ever even imagined possible. But we have less than a year and a half, and so much to do yet.  I know people plan weddings in a lot less time, but I want to know EVERYTHING already!! 
     I just realy wish that I felt happier more, that I had fun more often, i had more friends like the ones in movies... Maybe it's depression, it does run in the family, it's just that i mean, i wish i didn't have anything to be depressed about, nothing to be stressed over.. AHHHHHHHHH!! What the hell did I do to anybody? I need a vacation, a real one.. like a nice white sandy beach with my baby, intense sun givin me one hell of a tan.. but nooo my parents are going on a cruise in less than 2 days and I have to go to g'burg to stay with my sister. there are moments when I just want to cry, for what seems like no reason at all, but yet i guess there has to be a reason, i just don't know what it is.  There are so many people i miss and so many i don't, people, things, places, scenarios... if you think you can help, by all means let me know.
