worst ever
jesus christ, i'm such a fucking idiot. this has got to be the worst weekend of my life. yesterday was supposed to be fun because i had the day off and there was lots of snow. i went to go sledding with tim at the golf course. i don't know if any of you remember, but there's a curb thing there next to the golf course. and i went to park on the other side of the curb [which i've done a couple times before...and like all the other cars were doing] and...and i guess i picked a spot where the ground on the other side is lower than usual. because as soon as i got half my car over the curb, i heard a horrible scraping sound of the entire bottom of my car being fucked up. then i couldn't get my car off the curb. the more i tried the more stuck i got. then the car started leaking antifreeze and started overheating. yeah. remember the thing that i just got fixed on my car for $1600? I FUCKED THE SAME THING UP AGAIN. and this time it's my own fault. so i had to have a tow truck come and take my car. and now as if i'm not stressed enough over being in debt, welcome to hell.
i was hoping it would be something more minor, but of course not. of courseeee notttt. i've been crying since i found out this morning. nice fucking christmas spirit i'm going to have this year being like over $3000 in debt. plus my car insurance payment is coming up, plus two more christmas presents, plus books for next semester. oh god. excuse me, but i'm going to go continue moping and feeling sorry for myself now.
