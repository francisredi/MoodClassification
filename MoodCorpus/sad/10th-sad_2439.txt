Valentin's Day and the week from hell
It is offically V-day, and yet again I'm alone on this day, I'm beginning to think I will be alone for my entire life, so many people in my life are with other people, I'm happy for all these people, but it makes me wonder, when will it be my turn, I wonder what is so horribly wrong with me that no one wants to be with...I often times believe it has to do with the fact that I'm overweight which leads me to being not so confident around guys, but alot has changed since high school, I talk to guys more, so I even flirt with, but maybe they don't think this is flirting, and that I'm just being friendly, if they do think it is flirting, maybe the are repulsed because I'm think fat girl who wants there attention...I don't know anymore, but I get so lonely sometimes, I just want someone special in my life, that likes me no matter, and I don't want to settle and be with someone who I don't like, and I hate those guys who have some kind of weird of fettish for fat girls, I am a person not a type, maybe I'm not even ready for a relationship, maybe I need to work on these other issues that I have with my body, maybe I need to stop focusing on not having a relationship and just focus on making positive changes, alls I know is that I want to change, I want to lose weight, eat better, exercise more, I have decided to join weight watchers, and I don't care who knows it, I'm going to pay for it myself and I'm going to make it work, so happy V-day to everyone...single and taken, and esp. the single people it sucks when it seems like everyone has a significant other, it sucks being alone, how sad is this, I'm 20 years old, a sophomore in college, who has never had a valentine, never kissed a guy, never danced with a guy, never been on a date and never had a boyfriend, how did this happen? and when will it change? this week has me really stressed out...I have 2 tests and another on thrusday, but all I can focus is on how I am alone and really lonely....well this was a definite pitty party...that I throw in my lonely honor...poor me...not that alone really cares
