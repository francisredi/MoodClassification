Well the first day of spring semester is now over, and so now I am bored in my room not even having my usual homework to occupy my time.  I still wish that I were in Phoenix instead of here in Flagstaff.  I feel so lonely up here, even though I see more people and probably have more things to do.  
Currently I seem to be suffering from the same afflictions that have been plaguing my life since summer.  When Kenan and I broke up, and subsequently fell apart.  I never realized before last summer how important some people can be to your life, and how devastating losing them can be.  That is why I am so lonely up here in Flag, something that I did not have to deal with last year.  When Kenan and I broke up over the summer, we started a massively complicated relationship that has now degenerated into a catastrophic falling out.  I think that I finally came to accept that we were no longer dating, and that we were just going to be friends and now I feel like we are back at square one...again.  Once again Kenan is ignoring me and I feel like this will be the final fall out, that somehow we will not find a way to reconnect.  I miss him more than I can possibly say, and yet I know that he doesn't miss me at all.  The most frustrating thing about the current situation is that I know that I could make everything better for myself if I just decided to get over it and move on, to not be so upset about losing him, and just find new people that I can trust.  However, it seems that no matter how hard that I try to move on I just keep letting myself get drawn back in, and getting hurt over and over again.  Right now I just feel numb to everything, which is probably a bad thing, but maybe it is the beginning of the moving on/getting over him process .  I guess that I just need to concentrate on school, getting a job, and meeting lots of new people...cheesy I know, but hopefully it is a scheme that will equate to happiness.
