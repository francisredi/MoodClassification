And she takes another step...wondered how I ever made it through.
I've been writing in this book of mine. The only vivid memories I have, writing them down. I've begun to put them down, and as I go I can feel the anger/sadness/deep depression rising in me all over again. The day I came into a house covered in blood, the night I was told it was my fault for my mothers' suicide after being terrorized for 4 wks straight, having a machete pointed at you repeatedly, having your father hold a extension cord in front of you and being told its your fault he's come to this point. Being thrown into your room, belted, chased, clothes ripped, bagged and told to get out at 11 yrs old. Doors being ripped off, bed posts toren off while your sleeping. 2am wake up calls to yelling, screaming, banging. I still wake up at 2 am expecting to hear it all over again. Living in the shelter, I am nowhere over anything. I feel very alone when I remember of these things, I feel like the glass sheet I try so hard to keep intact starts to dripple with little pieces of glass onto the floor. It's getting harder to hold it.&nbsp; I've decided to not take anymore pills, drink or drugs. I know that it'll make the progress within me worse. It scares the shit out of me, thinking that I can't take something to sleep to make me forget everything for 8 hrs. Only to toss and turn, nightmares, and anxiety about what could happen.&nbsp;I feel like when I type this or talk about it, I'm whiny or trying to get someone sympathy. I don't want that, I just want to talk about it and get it out there and move on. But, because I feel this way I'll keep it inside and not come across a pussy or an attention whore.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems that way whenever I talk about anything.....
