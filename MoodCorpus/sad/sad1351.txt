A Life Remembered!!
Its been awhile.  Recently I found out that Becky, my sister, lost one of her friends in a very tragic and gruesome car accident.  Strangely enough this very same friend lost her husband in a car accident a year ago.  The accident happened Friday and I was alittle hurt that Becky didn't call to tell me about it.  I had to find out about it from my mother.  Of course it was not Becky's fault, she was very distraught, I just wished I could have been there for her.  I would have gotten in the car and been there in a heart beat if she had asked me too.  For those that don't know my sister Becky and I are identical twins; we share a bond that most will never understand and when she is going through pain, I can feel deep inside of me that something is not right.  I just attributed this feeling to maybe being nervous about finals and other things or paying for all the christmas presents.  But when I found out what had happened from my mother Monday night I knew that is why I wasnt feeling alright all weekend long.  Strangely I had been sick Saturday; all shaky and weak and I could not understand what was going on.  I though maybe I wasn't getting enough nutrition or that I was dehydrated but to started to fade after a day or so...   Saturday was the day that Becky found out about Gail's death.  To lose someone like that, completely unexpected, I can't even fathom it and hope I can only be there and be strong for my sister.
