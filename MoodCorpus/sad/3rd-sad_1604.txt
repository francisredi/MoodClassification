for my death will...
Recently I've been reading a lot about death situations on the internet to get ideas...Here a year ago in 2 more days I've been single for a year. But before that I've been single for 4 1/2 years, might as well as say 5. I've been depressed out my ass. I hear about problems with one of my friends and god i dont want to hear it cause..fuck idk its so hard to explain. I miss a lot of things that happened in the past and i wish they never happened. Old days with Dez and Jon...they will never happen again but god. What the fuck do I do wrong or what did I do wrong? I cant fight this goddamn depression. Josh tells me tonight, he's be diagnosed with Depression and has to take some shit for it. Thing people dont know, Been there done that. Nothing fucking works. God i fucking hate it, i blame it all on my parents for even having me. If someone is not meant to be with anyone, what is there left for that person? I have found a thing left for me cept my music and Im not into it anymore...me and aj. we fought over who would die first when they turned 27. 

I want to go first
