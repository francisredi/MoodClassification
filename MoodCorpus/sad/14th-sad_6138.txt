 Everythng was going as planned, but in life nothing ever stays that way. As I prepared to run the Boston Marathon today, my dream for the past 9 years, I recieved a phone call ending not only my dream but my world. Everything I had in life all came crashing down at that very minute. I was alone and scared. I had nothing, I have nothing still and there is nothing that will fix the nothing I've got. All I had was my father, for the past 12 years he's become my life, my dad, my mom, my best friend, my shoulder and my inspiration, and now I am all alone in the big world of happy families. More than 12 hours later the tears still havent completely stopped. Everytime somone says they are sorry, I cry harder, because they cannot be sorry, they cannot feel what I do. Unlike friends who have lost family, I am all alone. First my mother and brother and now my dad. The fact I have to admit he's gone makes me sick to my stomache. All I want to do is get out of here, leave for Texas or Reykjavik or even back to California with Marc. Out of all my family, and friends only Marc had ever saw the glimpses of greatness that my father was. I cried in Marcs arms for 5 hours today, without him moving a single muscle. I can count on him to help me through this, but I dont know if I can count on myself. If only I could stop shaking.
