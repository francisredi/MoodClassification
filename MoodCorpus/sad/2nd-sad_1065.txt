wow!
WOW what an emotional day i'll tell you. woke up early to go to Bradford for vicky's grandmas funeral. got there a little late but didn't miss to much. paid my respects to grandma. it was so hard not to cry. but i held it in as much as i could. seeing everyone else around me cry did a number to me i'll tell you that much. but i was strong. after the funeral home we all went to the cemetery... the place was so small. cause it really wasn't meant for lao people. haha lao families are just so freaken huge and then theres the extended family like me haha well we paid our last respects and said bye to her one last time. it was so hard to do. then we put her in this oven thing oh man! but yes she was cream-maded. so that she could be taken to laos to have another funeral with the rest of the family. she needs to be let go at home. 
then everyone went to a chinese buffet. and ate lots! then back to vicky's house we went. chilled there for a while. caught up with the family see what we've missed. then the kids just chilled out downstairs while the parents were upstairs. we played cards and just watched tv. joked around and just chilled out. didn't get home till 10 and didn't have a chance to go out with annie and kim for wings. this has been such an emotional day for suree. 

r.i.p grandma. i love you and i'll miss you. god bless.
