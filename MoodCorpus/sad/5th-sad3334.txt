So I found out what's bugging Ryan lately. He basically told me in so many words that he doesn't like any of the major points of my personality. Which translates to me that he doesn't like "me" (which was not denied when the question was directly asked) I feel so fucking hurt by this I'm like dying inside. It hurts to breathe. I'm telling you right now, this is about it for me. I'm at the ropes end. I am this close to having a break down. Not the kind I'm having right now, but the real kind. It makes me wonder if he ever really did "like" me and just sorta loved me because I loved him. It makes me wonder what else he's not telling me and it makes me wonder what the hell is next? This is the most miserable I've felt since when I realized my father wanted nothing to do with me. I'm seeing a trend here. First dad, then tina, now ryan. Maybe it is me. I don't know anymore. I really have no fucking clue. I'm just gonna sit back on this one and let him decide if this is even worth him "putting up" with me. I feel sick to my stomach right now. Just fucking ill with hopelessness, shock, pain, sadness, despair. I don't even want to get up tomorrow. I'm not even exaggerating right now. I'm really not. This is one of the most hurtful things that could ever really happen. I'm not laying blame. He can't help how he feels. I just don't know. Whatever.
