hormonal
I can't tell if it's the hormones or the complete lack of anything worth living for that has me crying right now.  It's the 5th or 6th time in 3 days that I've broken down in tears.   I can safely say the hormones have something to do with it, but just like the rest of the deep depressions I've gone through I know it has a solid foundation.  I hear these things - these thoughts I say to myself and I know they're true.  What the fuck AM I doing with my life?  I have no purpose, I've stopped caring about anything, and my existence revolves around... what?  I can't even say I have some vain, superficial focus.  I don't care... I'm not interested in anything.  The things I wanted don't matter anymore, the apartment is falling apart around me and I can't get the energy to clean up my own fucking filth.  I don't like anything, I'm bored all the time.  I'm angry, frustrated, tired and just sad.  

I got into a stupid arguement with Philip last night.  It was really pointless and I know I was just being a cunt and picking over nothing, but I cried myself to sleep and wished that I would miscarry.  I woke up and looked up how late you can have an abortion because what child deserves me as a mother?  I can't imagine how I can do this - I can't imagine why I'd go through with it.  I keep getting the urge to cut again, like I'm boiling over and there's nothing I can do.  I just wish I'd been more careful, I wish I wasn't like this.  I wish I could disappear, just end.
