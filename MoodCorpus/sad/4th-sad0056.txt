How do I help my Mom?
So I posted on a message board tonight for Living w/Cancer.  I am getting so stressed over my Moms condition.  I wish I could do more to help her but as it is I'm finding this all quite exhausting.

For instance we were discussing it earlier today so I took it upon myself to find a website on DCIS, information and a list of web sites for support groups.  I went ahead and forward her the link. As we start talking about it later, I ask if she got my email.  She basically makes it seem like I wasted my time.  That she already knew everything on the site in regards to her condition and that the support groups were useless.  I also posted a message with questions on DCIS on a breast cancer message board, and she got upset with me (so it seemed) just because no one had responded to her questions yet, like it was my fault for finding a shotty support group.  Then it's the constantly asking me "What would you do?"  I've told her 100 times that I support a mastectomy because there is a less of a chance of the cancer coming back and that it would be as dangerous as radiation, but anyway what do I know?  I feel that if she goes with my decision and it doesn't work out to absolute perfection that I will forever be blamed for her mistake.  Yes, I seriously feel this way.

This is all beginning to consume me.  I'm exhausted and just depressed.  It's not so much that I'm worried she's dying.  Her disease is in early stages and VERY treatable, but it's her mood and her "I give up" attitude that has me in a slump.  She just wants to ignore this in hopes it will go away but only ignoring it will make it worse and she feels proceeding with a cure will make it harder.  Things always get worse before they get better and I cannot stress enough that she has so much to fight for (like me!)  I don't want to be shelfish, God knows I'm not a shelfish person but how do I help and support her but at the same time keep up my well being?
