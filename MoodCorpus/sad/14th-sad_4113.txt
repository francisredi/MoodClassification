My feelings are really hurt right now. I'm probably over-reacting like I usually do, but still...
I went to an art gallery thing with Andrew and Julie and Alana this afternoon. On the way back, Andrew said, let's do something fun! But Alana had to go home to Hannah, and Julie said she had homework. So I dropped Alana back at her house, and went back to Andrew and Julie's to plan fun. Andrew called a friend in Windsor, but he wasn't there - so suddenly, all the fun plans were off, even though I still wanted to do something. 
I left, saying "sorry i'm not good enough to do stuff with without other people around," and came home here. 
No one else is really around/wants to do anything either, and I really wanted to salvage a bit of this work weekend by having some fun. I don't care what. But I guess that's not happening.
It's just not fun being the convenience friend - the person people hang out with because they know I'm here, and they don't have anyone better around to hang out with instead. And obviously, i don't have anywhere better to be because I'm always here, ready to entertain. 
I think I need to take this as a learning experience and become more self-sufficient, socially. I spend a fair amount of my time alone, but it's always been killing time between social events, however tentative. I think i need to start planning time to spend just with me, and to learn to enjoy my own company, however hokey that sounds.
At least I can become more constructive with my use of alone time, and do exercise and maybe work on my various writing projects. Do something productive. Finish knitting Dad's sweater. Not let my dishes pile up. Keep the house tidy and play with the cats more. These are all good things, right?
So then why do I feel so depressed at the thought?
