still depressed 
Last night was ok, I went over to Tristans and hung out with everyone that was there. I had to be around people otherwise I was getting worse. Well I only cried twice today, that's a improvement. I didn't even go to work today b/c I woke up feeling like shit. So I pretty much slept most of the day. I was watching a movie of Tom today that I have. I made it almost two years ago, even though we were barley talking while I was filming it b/c we started being friends and it was a year after we broke up. I just couldn't get over the fact that he wasn't over me while I was filming that tape and never realized it. Almost everytime I saw his face I would just cry. I also bought a really cool new web cam for $40. It was worth it though. I also made a new website. Doing html,stuff again makes me distracted and not think about things so much. But also being around people makes it awhole lot better bc theres only certain people who I can cry infront of. My new website is http://geocities.com/white_stripes7987/welcome.html Its still kinda underconstruction but check it out! Well I came to the conclusion why I think I miss Tom so much...b/c I can never have him back. Thinking about Matt still makes me a little sad. I really do hope me and him could go out again, he was the best guy I had since I can't remember when. But eventually, I'll get over Tom again, atleast me and him can be friends again and that I atleast can talk to him. Ive tried talking to some people about my problem but it feels like no one's really listening to me, not even my best friend. No one seems to understand how messed up I really am over this b/c around here in Shakopee no one's ever really seen me really depressed. Well anyway, I'm gonna get going and take a shower then going to work tomorrow.
