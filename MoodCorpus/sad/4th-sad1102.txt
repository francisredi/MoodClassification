I had a dream last night that I was walking Hershey and he broke free from his leash and I couldn't find him and then I went home and looked in the freezer and there he was in a shoe box in the freezer dead. 

When Licky died my parents wanted to put him in the freezer until the next day when we would take him to the vet and they would burn him up with all the other dead dogs. I hated the idea but I didn't know what else we could do. Then Baron said his mom told him we could bury him in her back yard. So that's what we did. But without baron there he would have spent the night in the freezer and then had his ashes all mixed together with all the other dead puppies. 

So I guess the meaning to the dream is that even though I take all the precautions to keep Hershey safe (the leash) I still can't stop bad things from happening, and if he ends up dying don't listen to my parents because they are sick individuals.

So, I'm sick with a cold and I'm spending new years eve alone in my room with a strawberry margarita and some chocolate oreo cookies watching the fourth season of Six Feet Under on DVD. Rented, since the actual dvds cost $99.99 everywhere I've looked. I feel like I couldn't be more of a loser. I wonder, if I wasn't sick, weather I would be doing anything different.
