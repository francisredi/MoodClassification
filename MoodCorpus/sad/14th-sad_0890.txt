I keep making myself sick
The past four days have been filled with stress and other negative emotions, which is why I haven't been updating. The group paper for J703 was a total mess, so I stayed up all Sunday night (until 5AM) rewriting it. I e-mailed it to the group on Monday, explaining that the drafts that they had sent me were amateurish, sloppy, and did not fulfil the professor's rubric. I was tense all of yesterday, fearing that the paper-writing group would e-mail me back saying that they were going to use one of the other versions, but fortunately they realized how much better mine was (I'm the only person who would get angry because some one else wrote another version of a paper). So that's finally resolved. But as soon as that gets resolved I find out that I didn't get into GA Tech, making my future plans a mystery. I feel like I have absolutely no direction or interest in anything anymore. The things that I thought I liked (e.g., political science, history, Japanese, library science) don't interest me. I just feel fatigued, like I just want to stay in bed all day. I'm even starting to feel a diminished interest for my hobbies, more like they are something I have to do than something I want to do. All the stress has made me sick and I just don't know what to do.
