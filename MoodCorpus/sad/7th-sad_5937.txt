I'm awake... I really wish I wasn't.  The stomach swelling has gone done so I can actually wear bottoms today, but I'm still a Kate-cicle.  I haven't gotten sick in about 12 hours, but I wish I could.  I know I'd feel better.   I'm sore and I'm cranky and I am in no mood to sit in a class room from 8:15-10:45ish.  

Tonight is the class that is really gonna SUCK!  It's the peer review of my Portraits and Proaganda paper.  Red already called me on Saturday night critiqueing it and asking me questions about the end of the paper, when she hadn't read past page 4.  She wanted to know if what she was wondering about would be answered or if she should write it down as a comment.  She is "concerned" that I will not take the critiqueing process well and the members of "the discussion" talked about how they are going to handle me tonight.  I politely told Red that I can handle positive critism very well and not to worry about it.  I'm about to take the members of "the discussion" and shove my paper so far up their asses that they can taste the ink.  I swear to god if tonight becomes another drama I will not be going out with them this week.  Hell I'm semi-already in trouble for not going out with them the past two weeks.  Yes, I have plenty of time to waste an evening having dinner with them when I have a 20 page paper due.  I already wasted enough time drinking myself stupid one night trying to forget that the paper ever existed.  Intelligent?  Of course not.  When you feel that the world is falling apart around you sometimes being intellegent isn't going to happen.  

God, I feel sick again.  Can't this day just be over already?
