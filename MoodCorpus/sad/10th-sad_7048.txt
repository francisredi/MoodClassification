maybe if i grew wings, maybe if you lost yours
what the fuck am i doing? why does every time im with her feel awkward? why do i do such stupid things? i dont know. ill never know. last night was bad. i was so depressed i drank until i had to throw up. and i have ever thrown up, ever. people like to invite themselves over to my house. my plan was to just hangout with her, play the song, and then do whatever. instead, james, jill, griff, and landon all came over, and i was so nervous and anxious that i had the worst stomach pain. add alcohol to that and i threw up. i made myself throw up though, and my stomach felt better afterwards. i put my arm around her, and i guess it was the mad amount of people there that ended that quickly, she told me not to do it, i forgot, due to the poisoning of my brain through alcohol, and did it again. im not sure if she said it like this exactly but it went something like this "i thought i told you not to do that" or something. so, me being drunk, im offended and grab the bottle of tequila and drink like 4 shots worth in like 10 seconds. then i went into the bathroom, and hugged my toilet, put my finger down my throat, and let it go. 

so far, every phone call has ended awkwardly, and just talking to her at all today has been awkward. 

why?
