An odd sad day :(
Weell so today was really weird! Because we had a funeral for Danny Sesker in our school. He was a soldier fighting in Iraq..! And outside of the school was a ton of cars and military men, and lots of people in suits. Then when you get into the school you walk past the gym that is set up for the funeral, so you see lots of flower, chairs, and the coffin :( with an american flag drapped over it. you walk a little farther and see more people dressed up really nice. It just gives you a terrible feeling to see that and be a part of that when I feel really sad, and just try to imagine what I would feel like if I ever actually knew him. I have one of my dad's friend off in Iraq now and I've known him for forever and idk what I would do if he was killed there...so through out that day it was just kinda sad, most teachers were at the funeral, so I didn't really have class in the morning. but it was just a sad day. and then I looked out and I saw how many cars were there! they filled everything! every single parking space we had! plus the entire soccer field! it was crazy! weell then I saw some anti-gay protesters! I was like OMG sooo mad! who would do that?! how EXTREMELY disrespectful! and it really made no sense! it just kind of made me mad! Buuuut one good thing is that me and Kels are goood :) I love that girl to DEATH! <3 and idk what I would do without her! that was kind of my day! I came home, went to sister's softball practice, then went to other sister's musical at the school, and now I'm here filling you, whoever you are, in on my day!
