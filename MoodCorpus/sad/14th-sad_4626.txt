last hello from OZ
That subject header came on automatically - I'm at an internet cafe in the city and obviously, someone, at some time, has been on this computer and written that. I'd expect them to be a foreigner, by the sound of it.

Today is spiraling in the direction of 'gloominess', though, I'm just been walking, listening to sad music, under a grey slate of a sky, it's cold. I'm feeling unattractive and lonely, basically, um, but that's just who I am. I'm not terribly upset or anything, I'm down. And spending more and more time alone. I really should make two phone calls this week, to two different girls. But will probably only make a phone call to one of them - about starting a band. It's a bit scary, i'll have to do it.

I'm in a very fobby place right now, and had to give a deposit to use this computer. I wonder how much it costs here. This, I should have checked before starting. Wonder how long I'll stay here? 

I was at mum's before, though, she's off to China on Friday. But I left and walked here. Lots of wlaking then. But no reason, really. Life feels very sad. What a bad post.
