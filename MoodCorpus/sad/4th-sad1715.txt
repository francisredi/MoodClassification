happy new year
My dog Smokey is sick. Really really sick. He has a cancerous growth somewhere in his abdomen, and the past couple weeks he's lost control of his bladder, his urine is bloody, he's constipated, and he won't eat. He has no energy; he'll lie motionless in one spot for hours on end. It's been really hard to watch while I've been home because he's obviously in pain. 

I realized tonight that I'm leaving tomorrow and in the shape Smokey's in, he probably won't be alive when I next come home. Dorky emotional as it may be, this really upsets me. I've had this dog since I was six years old. He's part of the family. This dog has been through pretty much everything with me. He's probably heard me play the piano more than anyone else in the world because he's always loved to sit on my feet while I play. The summer after my freshman year of college he let me hold him and cry almost every day, which I needed more than anything. He's so darn cute and fluffy. What the heck am I going to do without this dog?

Mom was talking of putting him to sleep within the month. She actually mentioned taking him in tomorrow morning before I leave. I know it's stupid to get worked up like this over an animal, but I can't help it. He's my puppy and I love him.
