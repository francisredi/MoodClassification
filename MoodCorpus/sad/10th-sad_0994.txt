You know I really need to get used to having to once in a while spend time alone. I hate it a lot, on the weekends I dread having to come back to my room, knowing that no one will be there but me... but sometimes it has to be that way and I need to deal with that. But god damn it is so hard. Refusing to go to bed because I know I'll have to wake up alone again. It's pathetic.
And things aren't really as fucking bad as all that are they? I mean I have great friends, I do like how most of my life is going at this point. It is just that glaring lack. That knowing I don't quite have it all. I'm going to be selfash, I am going to want it... even if I can't have it.
And I find myself walking home alone and I think to myself "How many more nights am I going to have to do this?" and the only answer I have is "as many as I fucking have to."
I swear that loving people is a curse a lot of the time. I see them. I see how beautiful they are. And I want to be a part of it, I want to be a part of it so bad. But I don't ask. I already know. I just sit there in the good moments and I pretend it is all mine, that I am there and I am part of it and I cling to that for dear life. Because it is all I have.
Supposivly sooner or later we all start to go numb, we stop feeling it, stop knowing it is there. I feel like it becomes shaper, the contrasts are getting bigger, and the more friends I have and the more people I love the more lonely I become. It's not really possible to withdraw anymore. Even if I didn't care about hurting those who do love me, I'll remember what it used to be like and I'll know I tore myself away from all the good things I had. On nights like this I wish I were made of stone.
