well today suck. i guess it is because it's friday 13. I hate my life and all boyz.  they make me sick. i went to see my boyfriend after school, and everything was okay. Well almost.  I just cant feel comfortable. I love him do death. That's my husband in all, but it's not working out. Well im not gonna divorce him (yet), but i know for a fact that im gonna try and work this out. He just makes me sick. All i wanna do is spend time, but im having a hard time just being next to him. What am i to do about dis? I just wish he understood how i feel. I try so hard to understand him and try to make changes, but he see little effort. He acts like im the worst person in the world to be with. He makes me feel bad everytime something goes wrong and makes me feel like i can do nothing right. Why? I wonder why? The last time i was in a relationship and something like this was happening, the boy was cheating on me. What if he is? What would i do? I wish I didnt feel the way i do about him. I cant help it but to love him. I wish i wasn't in love, because love is to painful?  I wish it all just go away.
