worst day of my life... (myspace blog went bad)
Today (yesterday by the time), I tested for, and gained a new rank in kung fu.  2nd degree brown belt, two steps from black belt.  Afterwards I sat and ate with the students, teachers, and most importantly, the Grandmaster.  He's an international celebrity.  My dad ruined my life.  He flipped out over me not finding him a chair and being like, "Hey dad!  Have a seat." but in truth, I was still looking for two open seats when he left.  He wants me gone, so I'm moving.  Don't ever ask me what I think about my dad, depending on my mood my answer will either be bad or downright evil.  He hurts me, he makes me cry, and he threatens me with physical violence.  He thinks he can mold me but I'm not his to mold.  I'm not his kid anymore.  Maybe when I was 2 and he was still in my life I was, but not now.  He doesn't treat me that way at all.  Tonight I wish I had owned a gun so I could have splattered my brains all over my wall.  Not to kill myself, but to make a statement about how he makes me feel.  Killing myself would just be the price I would have paid if I were to have made that statement.  I packed all my stuff, and I'm going to start shipping it as soon as I cash my paycheck.  I will miss my kung fu school here, and my friends, and my job, and the people there.  I will miss the mountains and the ocean breeze and the foggy nights.  I'll miss the wind and the almost tropical temperatures.  But there are some things I won't miss.
