Well, the good news is I got my period today. No no, I wasn't worried about that or anything, but it was DAMNED nice to already be taking a sick day. I always feel like crap on the first day. When I read 'The Red Tent' last summer, I have to admit I was kinda jealous that they got to chill out when they were in their womanly ways. Seriously, I wish women got an extra 12 sick days a month but I'm sure plenty of people would have a problem with that.

I've been feeling pretty bummed this week, thanks to hormonal fluctuations, January, and Jason being away on business. He's actually just camped out at a hotel in Alexandria but they're keeping him plenty busy and he has a roommate in his hotel room so I couldn't go visit, but he comes back tomorrow. And I'm hoping I'll be feeling well enough to work out since that also makes me feel better.

I took a nap from 5-7:30 tonight and I'm thinking I'm not going to be able to sleep well now.

I never talk about feeling sad or bummed or angry in this LJ anymore. Sometimes typing out what's wrong only makes it feel like a bigger problem.
