Everything sucks
Friday
Today is a half a day and the last day of the semester.  That totally sucks...for the most part.  I will never be in another class with almost all of these people ever again.  That's sad.  Next semester I have basically just AP classes which also sucks.  In my worst two subjects.  I had to pick either Mr. Hortert's class or History AP and I picked the AP class.  Well, I'll tell you what, I better pass those AP tests or I'm gonna really regret taking those damn classes.  I'll probably be in the same classes with the same fricking people the whole time.  That sucks, too.  If I had taken other classes, I would have had one last chance to be in a class with many other different people.  But no, I'm gonna be stuck with the same boring people.  On top of that, I already have an assignment for English - read a stupid book called Metamorphosis where this guy turns into a bug.  What's up with that?  I'm gonna miss my first period class the most with Mr. Rich.  No more Ashley, Shannon, Wadde or Adam.  No more Erica, no more just about everybody in this stupid school.  

By the way, I've come to the conclusion that I'm a pretty pessimistic person.  That sucks.
