Sick + Jobless :(
I still have pics to put up from Duffs...which was the original intention of this post, but fuck it.

I've been sick for the past 5 days.  Friday night my friend John and I went to Duffs because he's cool, my other friend was bartending, and I just really was having a shitty week.  We were only there a few hours, and quite early at that.  Well I drank too much and we left sometime around 12ish Sat morning.

I went to work at 10am and for the whole day I was freezing, had massive body aches, a sore throat that was on fire, and i almost passed out twice.  I thought it was just a bad hangover, but when I got home I passed out on the couch.  I had a fever of 103!  yeah, so I was sick, and it had nothing to do with a hangover.  I've had a fever for four days (today is the first day sans fever).  

So Monday my fever was around 102, and i could barely speak, but knew i had work.  So to make a long story short I called in sick, however no one could cover my shift.  Needless to say, I am now out of a job.  Blockbuster fired me.  

I don't know what I'm going to do now.  I seriously have massive creditors calling my house every fucking day.  I owe sooo much money, not to mention my student loans...and my car insurance that has to be paid.  I seriously need to find a job with decent pay, hours, health benefits, and hopefully something where I won't want to kill myself everyday.
