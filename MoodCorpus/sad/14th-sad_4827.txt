Decision
I have decided to do this and this only.  I think I'll just quit going on the computer period.  It isn't doing me any good and it is only making everything worse.  Each and everyday I only waste my life on staring at the stupid screen hoping to find something.   What that something is I have no clue, so I have decided to now to quit going on the computer overall.  I should have better things to do with my life, that I still have to find out but i will find it.  This year will be the hardest year of my life but I still have to endure it no matter what.  Though it won't stop hurting I'll have to live with that because I just don't want everyone around me to worry so I guess I'll just pretend that everything is alright.  I don't want them to stress about anything or to worry. The only thing that matters to me is everybody elses happiness not my own and I will keep it that way only because there is alot of things alot of people still don't know about me and they won't ever know no matter who they are just cause either I am too ashamed or embarrassed to even talk about it.  I am sorry for those who probably don't agree on me doing this but I think I will just seclude myself from everyone untill I have everything figured out and fixed cause with the crap that is going on in my life right now, I don't think I could continue to try and reach my goal with all these things affecting me...sorry...I just don't know what to do....Only thing I want to do right now is just be alone and I want to keep it that way...thanks.....
