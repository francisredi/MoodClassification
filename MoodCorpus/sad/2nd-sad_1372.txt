Lots to do, and I just wanna sit and be quiet
well, there is all sorts of news:

-tomorrow, i leave for Indy with Mackenzie
-i need to pack and there are very important things that i need to remember, i.e. my speeding ticket and my check book
-i also need to make sure to unplug all electrical appliances, including my computer, cell phone charger and iPod charger, iPod and headphones
-I dont want to forget my medicince either
-and i want to remember my jewelry
-rabbit slippers and clothes and toiletries. 
-go to Krannert and pick up my paintings and clean out my music locker
-go to the painting studio and pick up my other paintings and paints
-go to physical plant and drop off my painting studio key

Im sure theres a bunch of stuff im forgetting like cd's for the car and dvds for the long hours away from campus. on a much sadder note, my fish, one of the most handsome and colorful betas i have ever known has passed away. Rest In Peace, Lucius Keene, the Duke of Traherne. I'm sad that my fish died, but he had been looking kinda sick for a long time. and i knew he wouldnt have done well during the four hour car ride. so as sad as this is, im glad it happened now, instead of later. poor lil guy. I'll miss him.


Now I will attempt to get back to my busy agenda
