I'm just sad
I know graduation is supposed to be a happy time, and it is.  I finished college in 4 years, that's something alot of people aren't able to do.  I'm graduating with a degree in Elem. Education, something I worked hard for and love to do.  All of this makes me happy.  Then there is the sad part where I just want to cry.  I feel like I've finally found myself.  It took freaking 4 years to do it, but I am finally happy with who I am and now I have to move back home to my boring life.  All my friends are going their separate ways which makes me very sad.  I have to move back home with my parents...blah.  I'm still searching for mr. right...blah.  I keep wanting what I can't have...blah.  So there is the sum of my depressing life at the moment.  I'm going to miss the life I created in greensboro, my own life.  Not my parents, not anyone elses, just mine.  Now I'm back to the daughter and dependable person who is always there.  It sucks sometimes being in that mold as the one who everyone always goes to because she'll always help out.  Ugh, now I'm really depressed and dreading the finale of my college years.  But on a positive note, I get to see my girls next week.  Oh how I've missed them, even though it's only been 2 weeks.  How am I gonna make it not seeing them all the time?  I've been so spoiled.  Life is hard sometimes.  I know it's not supposed to be easy and part of life is moving on, but damn it sucks sometimes.  Ok, so enough bitching about my life.  Oh did i mention that i'm always wanting what i can't have?  So goes my life.  

Enough for now.
