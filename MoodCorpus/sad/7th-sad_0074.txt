Hitting a rough spot
Yeah so life's taking that stupid turn that I hate it to take.  When things feel weird but I can't figure out what to focus on to make them better.  When Meghan was living here I never got bored.  I was either so happy to have someone who would do those stupid little things I like to do, or so pissed off because she had done some spontaneouis thing that unintentionately hurt me.  She never did anything with the hope that I'd feel pain so I can't stay mad at her.  I wish I could talk to her for even just an hour so I could sort through all the shit I've been thinking this week.  I can't write her the things I want to say because there's those days of waiting for her to get the damn letter and respond.  Then I have to respond to that and the conversation could take weeks.  Brighter side:   MUCH BRIGHTER SIDE: Since Meg left I have brought my bank account up to a positive number (when someone(not meg) steals your atm card it's hard to stay above zero), saved enough money to pay off a good chunk of my credit card, started cleaning and rearranging my room to the way I want it(with room for a bed I'm now saving for), become serious about school, and maybe missed her...a little.  Not really her persay but having her around.  How can I ignore her when she's not here?  Alright...so tomorrow I need to apply for an emergency loan, go to all my classes, and eventually do my laundry and finish my room.  Then I can feel at ease. The stress nightmares were beginning to take their toll.  I'm not happy.
