Death is just a part of life that we have to deal with whether or not we like it
I don't know why, but sometimes it seems that deaths come in waves.  Odd how it happens like that.  Just like last summer I lost my grandmother and great uncle and about the same time my friends from high school lost their grandfather unexpectedly as well.  But hey, we're not the only ones that have lost loved ones...Everyone has.  But I guess this post is mostly for my dear Japanese sister Tomomi  who has lost three of her rats within the past month (from Dececember to today).  She called me crying at 6 a.m. this morning because her dear rat Scissors was dying right in her lap.  Gosh, I wish I could've been there to comfort you Tomomi, but I'm so far away.  I know I wasn't much help considering the fact that I was still groggy.  I know it hurts a lot to lose something so precious and dear as a loved one, whether a pet or family (actually, in many cases pets ARE family).  Geez, and the real kicker is the fact that you lost Rainer Maria not too long ago, and now Scissors so unexpectedly. :(  My thoughts are with you big sis and I know you are feeling a lot of pain right now, but at least you know that you are not alone in these feelings.  But despite the fact that they have left you they will always be with you in the memories you have, and I'm sure that Kai, Rainer Maria and Scissors would be glad to know that you loved them until the end.  I think that is the important thing.
