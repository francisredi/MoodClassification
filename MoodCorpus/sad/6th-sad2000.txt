Nobody does the Blues like John Lee Hooker...
Prom is getting really close and I don't have a date.  It's my senior prom and I don't have a fucking date.  That sentence needed the F word to truly show how I feel about that.  It sucks bad.  I can't bring myself to ask the girl I want to, which doesn't matter because she probably already has a date.  She's one of those girls that are really cool and down to earth, and really hot at the same time.  I'm comfortable around her sometimes, and I'm not sometimes.  I don't know what my fuckin problem is.  Sorry for all the fucks, it's just that kind of day.  I really don't feel like myself today.  I mean, I'm not sick, I just don't feel right.  I feel like no matter what I do, I could do a little better.  I'm sick to death of struggling.  That's why I'm going to make something of my self.  I'm also sick to death of my "friends" being complete pricks to me one minute, and then acting like nothing happened the next.  That reminds me, I hate people who are only cool to you when no one else is around.  I know who my real friends are.  I may be gullible, but I'm not stupid.  It feels good to vent sometimes.  I'm finished for today.  Maybe My Name Is Earl and The Office will make me feel better tonight.  Bye for now.
