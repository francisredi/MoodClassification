well idk what happened but i kno my support team from oh beautiful is pretty much all in here so any positive thing you have to offer me at this point would be a push towards the "staying alive" mark on my life meter right now.
i just weighed myself (yeah i kno its late at nite but still) and it was 141lbs. 
what the hell. i was 135 like 5 days ago... granted i havent "went to the bathroom" in about 4days and its practically that time of the month, ive been eating like a pig, not having time to workout like i should and overall just sucking.
i missed 3 classes (out of 5) this week.  i didnt hand in an important project ( i still havent finished it), i had a nervous breakdown at school in front of my department chair and one of my teachers, im super depressed and i just wish i were dead. and on top of it im incredibly fat and its all my fault.  i honestly think its all linked to me quiting drugs 2weeks ago. ive been MISERABLE ever since.  i just took 3 benadrylls so i could knock myself out, ill probaly sleep all day tomorrow. 
i have to lose this weight, idk what has gotten into me. im disgusting. :(

i hope (PRAY actually) that everyone is doing better than me.  
help me out guys, i really need your support right now :(
