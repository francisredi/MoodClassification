I don't know
Why were the remnants of her so prominent in my apartment? Why were her words carefully folded in their originality, her pictures preserved to perfection?  Why were his poems constructed around her beauty, her timeless shape?  My bones run deep into his eyes, piercing his thoughts with hatred and sadness.  Her memories of happiness and love.  His description of her brought tears to my eyes, how could their love evaporate?  How could I believe I was the source of his fantasies, many nights spent alone only thinking, imagining....I can't.  Me, with my naked misfortune (or fortune as I see it), my self-destruction and self-doubt...the list goes on....  The love I once felt permeating every inch of my being, now blows delicately away, the beauty he once saw in me, now slowly drains much like the blood from several wounds.  Why were his words to her so kind and genuine, his phone calls so endearing and thoughtful?  Why were my letters disgarded, left on the stove underneith can-openers and packaged noodles?  Why were my pictures lost?  Why were the words toward me so harsh?  Why was I once the one and suddenly nothing?  Why do I listen to this hatred?  Why do I feel so lost and so in love yet so fearful and so self-loathing?  I am more alone than I have ever felt.  Why are the hugs and kisses forced, the words forming softly around pity, I am choking on my own depression and it runs so deep I can't stand it anymore.  Why was I once the one who he longed to embark on endless journeys with, the one he wanted to walk down a naked isle....What happened and why was I always pierced with needles of frustration rather than told what I was capable of?  What's wrong with me..
