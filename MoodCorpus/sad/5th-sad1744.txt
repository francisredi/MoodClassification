What is wrong with my family?
Hmm maybe our whole family should become drug whores and take depression pills.  Apparently my dad is taking them now...no surprise there.  I still have mine and some days god do I think of taking a ton of them.  Carlee wrote quite a bit of death poetry and mom found it and now Carlee's weird oh and she eats way to much and I swear she has an eating disorder.  Now me everyone knows my whole story on that one.  Which isn't going to way I would like it to right now but we don't speak of that right now.  Things arn't bad enough for me to get help and please don't anyone try to get me help you'll know if I need it.  *sigh* seems like the only one who's not as depressed as the rest of us is mom and I can only think it's because she gets away from us enough to not go totally insane.  Dear god I know she cries a whole shitload when dad's being a fucking dick but sometimes I wonder.  I keep thinking maybe things will get better once I move out but now it's not looking to good in the money department so I don't even know if I will be going to college let alone getting the hell away from here.  And even if I go to camosun next year where am I going to live?  In a cardboard box?  Looks like it at the moment.  Ga I have to get away for a few days.
