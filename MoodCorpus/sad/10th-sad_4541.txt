how can one person cause so much pain without even realising?

to _________

do you know how much pain i am in?? do you know how much you have hurt me?? do you know how much i love you?? ... why is this so hard?, we are ment to be in love not fighting all the time, 

i often wonder if we should end this, if i should move on and leave you inj the past where you cant hurt me anymore, but everytime i do i hate myself for thinking like that. you dont know what you are doing your not doing it on purpose, it my fault, i always do this, i love and trust people so much and then they do something and i end up in the corner crying and asking myself why i dont just cut myself off from every one. and then someone comes along and cheers me up again, but then they turn out to be fake. then i hate them for it. then i realise i am fake. i act happy so people dont know how much pain i am in, i keep myself locked up so no one can hurt me... that fails... it doesnt matter that they dont know the real me they still seem to be able to hurt me so much that i end up in the corner staring at the blade on my bedside table.

why do i keep doing this to myself??
