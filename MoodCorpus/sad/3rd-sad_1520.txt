Prince Charming
rendered tactless by Christmas, I'm lacking punctuality &amp; a kind tongue.&nbsp; Parentally "prepped" for the upcoming fall, he's finally tumbling; I'm hunched some where between devastated rage and just plain devastation.&nbsp; I never thought I would refer to Tim as a him, but I also never thought it would come to this.&nbsp; so here we are, hunched &amp; falling.&nbsp; and maybe she's his everything; after all, I know he's mine.
&lt;&lt;rewindThis is a story of the forever friend; an epic tale so rarely talked about &amp; even more rarely lived.&nbsp; 
&gt;&gt;forwardThis is the release of the forever friend; I've come to realize that this could never be fixed by my demanding high school nature of immediate satisfaction.&nbsp; There will be no late night calls or notes passed asking what the hell you're thinking; we're past all of this, or we're supposed to be.&nbsp; defeated &amp; coping.&nbsp; (Please know that) I despise her, but love you; she's wearing your ring but I've already taken the fall.&nbsp; oh best friend, we will be the greatest love story never told.
