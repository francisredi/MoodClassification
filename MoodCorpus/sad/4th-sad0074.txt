*sigh*
The more I see this week, the more moving at the next migration seems like a better and better idea. Too much bitterness. Too many people who've tossed out the word "family" who really don't seem to know what the weight of that word means.

I was chatting with another friend of mine about my current feelings, and my thoughts on moving to a new server and starting up our own HNM/endgame LS. Surprisingly, the idea appealed to him, and said if/when the time comes, he and his significant other would be interested in joining us. It made me smile and feel like Falc and I aren't alone with being disillusioned by the people of Fenrir.

The more I see though, the more I feel the end of FatelessDreamers is not so far off. It makes me very, very sad when I think about what I gave up to join them, only to watch is start to fall apart at the seams a few months shy of my one year anniversary of my foray into the "endgame" of FFXI.

On the upside, hit 32 blm. My Leaping Boots sold and I picked up Blessed Trousers and a pair of Errant Pigaches. It's still a ways off, but my whm is starting to shape up the way I was hoping. A bright spot in an otherwise dark day.
