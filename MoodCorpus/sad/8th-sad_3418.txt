so man its beena  crazyyyy week. since last friday i have been experiencing amazing mood swings. they usually are... "i'm happy" then, BOOOM i'm really depressed which lasts a while then its gone. its insane. i emailed my docotr after having a major break down thursday night. this involved massive sobbing which i haven't done in a while. i didn';t want toby to go, i was stressed and just depressed. i was tired of it all. i took a pill and went to sleep, which i'm going to do now. it helps. i claled my mother. i'm calling my psychiatrist monday and have her communicate with my doctor her. I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN MY PHYSCIAL HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH. happy pills...yay...birthcontrol + happy pills...isn't always the best combination, so says my psyciatrist, after  my episode with seasonel. i assumed that since this had a once a month cycle rather than a 3 month, it would help and yasmin is supposed to help with PSM but its gett ing worse. i'll keep you updated. everyones home this weekend so atleats i won't be alone. ok, i'm going to crawl under covers now. i'm also keeping a journal of my moods so i can show my doctors and prove this isn't a "ten minutes at night i feel depressed" its a "i feel deppressed all the time, and somtimes i feel happy for a few minutes, but the depression is at the back of my mind and sometimes it flares up and i start to cry" yah ok bye.
