Teaching
No teaching tonight, due to one of my little old ladies falling and hurting herself on the radiator.  Can't say I'm all that disappointed (apart from the fall, natch), because the other LOL is getting on my tits something awful.  I brought Welsh scrabble for the last two lessons of last term, for some fun; she proceeded to speak English, complain about her hand, and be unable to form words on the board the whole way through.  Then she whinged that playing Scrabble was doing nothing for her grammar.  I don't know how I didn't yell at her, but I managed to keep it to "If you'd speak Welsh through the lesson, then it might."  The fact is that I brought the Scrabble because her vocab isn't very good - she can never recall anything, and is painfully slow when she tries to make sentences in Welsh (that aren't translated from reading what's in front of her), so she gives up and speaks in English - which consequently means her grammar is bad.  Argh!

I actually don't know how to teach grammar either.  I never got taught any in any language, and consequently I have no clue.  And no time to teach myself either.  Nor indeed do I know what I could teach that a book wouldn't do better - after all, I can repeat what's in a book, but they haven't learned it till they've gone away and tried to remember/taught it themselves!
