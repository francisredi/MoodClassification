memories hurt
I was just down in my parents basment looking though my boxes of books for ones i would like to take over to my apartment.  In one of the boxes i found and old school project colodge (sp) book i had made.  in paging though it, i came to a page i had devoted to pictures of my girlfriend at the time and me together. and i started to remember when they were taken, and being with her and all sorts of stuff like that. i started to cry.  I loved her so much, and i miss her even more now.  Lis and i were together for 3+ years, and when i broke up with her, i was it was the hardest thing i ever did.  i should never have broken up with her. we loved eachother so much and got along so well.  i was really just a blind, nieve, imposibly stupid morron for doing it. i listened to other people and my own fears rather than my heart. i have regreted it ever since.  i have never been really happy ever since. the only consolation i have is that i hear she is happy with her new boyfriend and has been with him for some time (about 2-3 years) but i know that if she ever came up to me wanting to be with me again,(not that she ever would) i would drop everything and go to her groveling and appologizing for hurting her and leaving. why did i have to be such a stupid git? 

they say that with age brings wisdom.  that is true, and mybe thats what i was really seeking when i left her, i dont know, but something that they dont say is how that wisdom brings increadably amounts of shame and guilt for the wrong choices you have made in life.
