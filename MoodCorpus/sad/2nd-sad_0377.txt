life's tough.....where's my helmet?
I suck...I am always wrong, and am to weak to stand up to my past.  I can't believe in the bible or God the way most do.  I just can't!  If everything happens according to God's will, then my past was the doing of God's will.  I was meant to be abandoned.  I was meant to not know anything about my dad.  I was meant not know half my family.  I was meant to know very few people of my own blood.  I was meant to grow up feeling rejected and alone.   I was meant to feel like it was my fault I had no dad, my fault he isn't here, my fault he left.  I did something wrong before I was born to make God take him from me.  I would rather believe that all these just happened and that no one made them happen.  But apparently I can't believe that, otherwise I am wrong and foolish.  And as I continue to type this I am continually be proven wrong.  The person I am talking to is a good friend, he isn't trying to cause harm and yet he is.

To believe in all that, I am being told means, that I have to believe in everything in my past.  EVERYTHING.  I have to believe that no one really cares, no one appreciates my love, everyone wants me to care about their problems, but they don't care about mine.  You know life really sucks, who can't agree with me on that?  only people who are naive can believe that life can NOT suck.  I face the fact that life sucks, but I want to know why it sucks so much.
