Well, it is the night of the full moon.I felt this would be the best day to change my user pic.That's Ryan and myself at last August's Ren Faire in Gig Harbor.Emotions got high last night in the sense that I was cring and Ryan couldn't make up his mind.We broke up for about five minutes, but he felt that wasn't the right decision and thankfully decided to work on things with me.It's going to take months but we both need to work on things, hopefully the stress won't get to us.I still feel crushed from last night.My heart broke last night and in a way I just want to crawl up in a corner to hide from everything.I really can't wrap my mind around anything.I want to work on my fairy tarot but I can't bring this sadness to the cards, they're too sensitive for it.Hell, I am having problems with it so in truth there is barely anything that can help soothe it for now.I think things are going to be precarious for the next while.In a way it reminds methat I don't really have that many friends, and fewer that I am able to talk to on a daily basis or even when I need it.It doesn't help to be in college either because I Haven't really made any new friends because everyone is concentrating on work.Tiffany seems to have a nack for calling me during psychology.I'm going to have to wwrite out my schedule for her so that she knows when not to call me*chuckles* Atleast I have had it on vibrate everytime though it's interesting when I have to catch myself befor I jump out of my seat because I have it in my hoodie pocket.

*sigh*I don't even think I could draw right now.In a way i just really want to lay down and cuddle while watching a movie.I guess we can watch the YuYu Hakusho movie that Frost let me borrow yesterday.Or just anything that isn't even more depressing.I've already wiped my eyes to much because they are starting to burn.I really should be starting on my psychology but I don't have the mind for that either.I want to cry but I'm too tired to do so.Maybe I should just light my candles, sit in the shower, and meditate for a little while.I wouldn't mind holding Ryan while in the shower too.I did that when he was sick and for me it made me happy.Not just to cuddle and be close but to be able to do something for him.As off late it seems that I don't do anything more than cause him stress and make him upset.I think I will go take a shower now and let him get back on the computer....
