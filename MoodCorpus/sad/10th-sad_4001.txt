More Rantings
Ok i just have to get A LOT of      off my chest.First all, peopl     ing suck. I'm so sick off how people act and how they think the can treat me.It just makes me feel even more insecure. I feel like my friends don't even want to hang out with me anymore, or they would rather be with other people. I dont even know why me and Pico are having this stupid party, its not like im cool or hot enough for pico anyways, as a freind is what i mean. He tells me that isent true but i think it is. Me and Jessie dont even seem  that close anymore, i think she would rather hang out with Kelly because Kelly is cooler than me. I have nothing against Kelly, I like her a lot, but sometimes i dont think she likes me and she is a lot prettier than me so i can see why jessie would liker her better. My classes dont seem to be much of a help or distraction, they stresss me out sooo much. I put so much pressure on my self to do good i wonder sometimes if it is even worth it. If i dont get where i want to go in life ill probabaly realize school was a waste of time and i should have been a     ing stoner, because it would not have made any diffrence.All of this      makes me think about cutting again. kjrbfjsdf.
I     ing hate that. I feel so dumb thinking about it. I hate it when people do it.And i thought i was over it. PSSSH, i never seem too really get over anything.
