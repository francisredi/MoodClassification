Mental breakdown
I had a rather weird mental breakdown yesterday. I actually don't know exactly why it happened but suddenly I felt so totally useless.
It had to do with my drawing, I went on about that I "should never touch a pen again" and that I "should burn my drawings because they're useless and ugly".
Poor Scarecrow was the one who had to hear me go on and on about that (on MSN). I was sitting in my room crying and hating myself and my drawings, self-confidence was down below zero, and she was trying to tell me that I did not suck. It didn't help at all, I was already down and it felt like nothing could bring me back from those dark thoughts I had. And well, I guess she didn't really understood in what state I was in because her word that were going to help me only made me feel even more useless and crappy.
"You're not the best artist I know but your not bad."
"You draw like I did about a year ago."
Both of them made me cry floods of tears and made me feel like I should give up drawing... And I honestly thought of giving it up, I felt like it was no idea to be drawing if the drawings only sucked and no one liked them... I still haven't recovered fully from that breakdown. I haven't burned my drawings, it hurt too much to do that and I've actually tried to draw some more afterwards, though I don't think&nbsp;I'll show them to anyone... Not yet, I still suck. -_-
