Exams weren't too bad. My worst was my World Geography but I think he's going to curve it because everyone did so bad on it. He always tells us that he doesn't make the test, but I know he did because I typed some of it for him so don't let him bullshit you! I got a 65%. I'm not too proud about that but the smartest kids in my class got low C's and D's.  Tomorrow we have our third and fourth hour exams, for me them are probably going to be my hardest... I'm not excited, but we have a half day so I at least have something to look forward to!

I wish I could make it so arguments never happened in the first place. Everything I do gets criticized unless it's losing weight, and when we talk about it he says "I'll support you in everything you do." Whatever though... you know?  I know it's not meant to make me feel like this, but I really feel like I'm not worth anything anymore and I'm just wasting my time. I feel like a failure... I think I'm fat, even though deep inside I know I'm not super fat, I still feel like it.  I told Jordan today that he might have to find another date to prom because I don't think I would look good in a dress...

I feel so horrible today
