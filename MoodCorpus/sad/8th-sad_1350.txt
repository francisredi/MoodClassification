I won't lie... I'm pretty damn depressed right now. I dunno why... things have been oksay latelt but I still don't fell right. It's wierd you know, having things pretty damn close to prefect and yet I'm still not happy. I don't know what my deal is. I need to get out. I haven't really left anywhere for like a wekk and a half... mainly because I was sick and also because I've been broke and so has ma. I dunno. I'm thinking of going and keeping max company... he's on probation and can't really do shit so if I went over there I wouldn't end up doing anything stupid like I usually do. I dunno... maybe I'll start hanging out with Stephanie again. We're supposed to go over to Kevin's next thursday but I don't know if I feel up to it. I don't really feel like doing anything and I really need to figure out why because it's bullshit. Whatev.
I finished my science for the mp today. And I finished one of my history books like the first day. So that leaves my other history book, accounting, literature, psychology and my together classes of english and life skills/gym. I should be able to get it all done. Two extra classes this semester is gonna be rough but I can handle it. As long as no shit goes down I think I'll be ok.
