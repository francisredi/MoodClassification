My work did not hire Weasel!!!  And my boss thanked me for giving him warning :)  I win twice.

On the downside, I have been thinking about Lion and crying.  I also think about him at really inappropriate times like when I am kissing Bear.  I think my feelings for Lion are much stronger than I suspected.

I miss him terribly.  I believed that getting over him to have my dream relationship with Bear would not be too hard.  But I am actually getting worse not better.  I am really worried.  I hope this is just a hump I have to get over.  Being monogamous is really important to Bear.

Anytime I am upset about Lion, it makes Bear feel guilty for not being a monogamous partner in the first place, which drove me to look for affection elsewhere.  And then for making a contract he couldn't keep with me regarding my relationship with Lion.  And then for me breaking up with Lion.  So he gets sad and feels guilty anytime I am sad.  And then I feel terribly guilty for feeling sad, because if he sees it, he will feel worse.

I need to break this cycle.  I need Bear to be the one who cheers me up.  But instead my sadness just springs a depression circle.

I am sure it doesn't help that Bear's dad died a few days ago.
