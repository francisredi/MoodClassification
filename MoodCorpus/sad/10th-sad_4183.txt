I hate people
So, my question at this point in time is why people do stupid things even when they are told the right thing to do? Why do say they want to do all this stuff and they never get around to it, and waste other peoples time bitching about it incessantly? Why can't they just go and do what they want to do and not become failures? But no, they keep on doing it over and over again. Why can't I make any good friends that I can rely on? Why do I have to be so stupid all the time? I am mad at people right now, specific people who don't seem to get the hint that when you do certain things, it hurts me a lot. Mainly because I am stupid and pointless. I hate this, I really do. 
My teacher spelled the word practice wrong and it bugs me. I did not however, bother to correct her, though I stared at it and thought about it all during class. 
My cousin is coming to visit in July and I do not want him to, I will be taking math and I will have a job and I do not want him here. Why do these things have to happen to me right now?
I have one good thing right now and that is my boyfriend.
My parents want to see where he lives. I do not want them too see it, they will mock and make fun of the place that I call sanctuary. The war begins. I will win this one. They do not need to know certain things in life, they can live without this information I am certain.
