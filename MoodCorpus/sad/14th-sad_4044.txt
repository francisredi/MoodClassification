So when do I go back?
I keep telling myself this. I've been home for a week now, and its still all so very sureal for me.  What really throws me for a loop is not having someone around all the time. At first the freedom of not having anybody around felt liberating. Now.. its bloodly lonely and depression. The part that really gets me is that you have the great and joyous reunion with people at home and all that, but it only last a day or two. People get used to you being back quicker than you do.  

It is quite possible the selfish side of me that thinks it, it almost like like being taken for granted in a way.  "Yeah, great, he's back! Now lets forget he's been gone for two years!"  This is an extreme and none-realistic example of course, but that's what its felt like.  Its like being surrounded by people in minute, and then the next they are all gone and you're left wondering what the crap happened. 

Again, I'm possibly being selfish in the matter. I know people have lives.  I am well aware of that.  I can't wait to get one again!  Its just for now I'm still readjusting. People I used to know and talked to a lot aren't around much anymore because life has taken them in different directions.  Its just really weird for me becasue I came back from the places life sent me.  It makes me feel out of place and I don't like it!

So please excuse me as I deal with my post-mission depression. 

Thank you.
