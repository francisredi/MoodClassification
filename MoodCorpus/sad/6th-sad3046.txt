One Wish <3
heey. ohk my life absolutely sucks. i wish i had better friends, not that i dont love them to death but... i never do anything every frickin' weekend. if i want some one to sleep over, my mom says no. i really can not wait until my friends start driving. i will never ever be home! i will be out every weekend. i am so sick and tired of sitting here doing nothing. i feel like absolute shit. i'm pretty much in tears, like why dont i ever do anything ? this is supposed to be high school, i am supposed to make the best of it and im not. i here - sitting alone, doing nothing. once the spring and summer comes i am going to have to make a change. i really wish i had laura's life. she seriously just has the best life. she has so many friends, she's pretty/skinny and her mom lets her do things. im very just depressed right now. i dont understand my life. i can not wait until college so i can do what ever the hell i want. ugh - im sad. im going to&nbsp;go + clean my room &lt;3

p.s - my mom said she would help me pay for my car&nbsp; =DONLY 572 DAYS UNTiL FREEDOM ! ! !
