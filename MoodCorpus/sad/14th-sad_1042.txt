Small update
Have a few things to journal about.
First fandom.  made mod at a_f. It's safe to post again! No more spam! Really though the stupid was giving me a headache. Oh and I'm trying to wait till Friday to see the new episode and so far it's been going well. Only saw a few screen shot which I can hardley remember.So hopefully I'll remain an episode three virgin. 
Speaking of stupid the ZADR fandom had al ot of that yes? Yes,that's why I'm being turned off from it. The stupid burns. So don't expect anything ZADR related for awhile. I'll still finish my sentences for .
Soon... Anyway you that AU prince and princess thing I was planning to do? Well if I ever get to it it's going to be a DATR. I switched the roles of Zim and Tak. Okay now personal.
On Sunday I went to the zoo. It was so much fun. Even more so since I haven't been to the zoo in years. So much fun. Monday I went back to the dance class.
It was different. Everyone dropped on the floor crying. It was a dance class at church so you can figure out why. It was something to remember. I finally figured out what I'm going to do for my birthday. Which is on the 14th.*wink wink nudge* No I kid,I kid. Going to the omnimax and Olive Garden with Jordan. It's going to be fun. Well that's about it.
