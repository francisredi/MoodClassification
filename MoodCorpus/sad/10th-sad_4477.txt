Oddly depressed
I attended 2 amazing shows today, truly uplifting excellent shows -- great scripts, acting and design.  I concored the eviil microsoft, i took a really engaging class.  I should be tired but exillerated.  Instead I'm depressed.  i'm lonely.  Its odd its not like I'm not used to spending my evenings alone.  Its not like a have a brilliant social life.  But I am feeling alienated and lonely.  Even the pretty snow has me down.   I don't think I'm worried about the shows (the one that performs friday or the one that is loading in without me).  OK, i'm worried about the shows, but that's normal and its not anxiety its depression.  I actually amd getting more exercise (walking anyway) than i usually get.   OK, i skipped diner tonight, but i had a large late lunch so i don't think thats it.  I wish I knew why I was down.  I'm not good at the social butterfly thing, which is going on all around me.  i'm somewhat intimidated by a lot of what's around me.  And I feel like i have a lot to live up to -- but again that should cause anxiety and I'm not feeling that at all.  I want a hug... a real one not a "oh darling we did a show together in the ice age, how are you oops gotta run" type hug that are very prevelent.  I've had a bit of enjoyment being near all the ambiguous/mixed/undecided sexualities and overjoyed at the level of "so-what"edness that the sexualities bring out here (which I was a bit worried about in this Mormon -- I mean LDS -- strong hold).  It is nice being with a large group that takes the information/clues/evidences processes them and doesn't let that affect the view of the person they are meeting.  LA has a pretention that this is true (but it isn't through out the city) and it ain't even close to true in Fresno, so i am enjoying it here.  or at least i should be.  I brought some movies with me.  Maybe I'll watch a few scenes of something and see if that cheers me up.  Of just go to bed.  i gotta get up in 7 hours

cheers
