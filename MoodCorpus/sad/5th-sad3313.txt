late night rant

What makes a person a best friend just that and not your girlfriend/boyfriend?&nbsp; At what point does one decide not to take that chance and why is it always the same excuse of not wanting to ruin the friendship?&nbsp; I really want to know why someone can be such great friends with someone yet not want to go any further?&nbsp; Why do we, me included, always stop and not want to date our good friends?&nbsp; Aren't the best of lovers are the best of friends; so why are we all so afraid of taking the final leap.&nbsp; Our soul mate/our ultimate confidant could be that leap&nbsp;we're not taking...so we could be losing out on something grand.&nbsp; Our good friends are the ones that know us the best so it makes sense, right?&nbsp; You would think so but it's not the case.&nbsp; We're all so afraid for our own reasons and never take the chance. I just wish I knew that line and how to break it, things would be a lot easier if I did.&nbsp; I wish I wasn't so afraid of taking those chances, who knows how different my life would be.&nbsp; I just need someone to come and sweep me off my feet and make me stop overanalyzing everything.&nbsp; You think you have a moment with someone,&nbsp;a moment when the world just stops and it is just the two of you looking into each other's eyes.&nbsp; You even smile everytime you think of it and get chills too...but then you&nbsp;you realize&nbsp;all these moments become just good friend moments for the other person.&nbsp; Life is just not fair.&nbsp; Why does someone else get the man of your dreams?
I feel like I don't belong in Tiverton anymore.&nbsp; Tiverton just seems boring and unexciting to me now and I honestly don't know how I entertained myself throughout my childhood.&nbsp; I love all my friends here to death but it's time I let go of calling this place home.&nbsp; I realize I have more than one home now and that coming home for breaks will always be awkward, for lack of a better word.&nbsp; Providence is my 2nd home but it's full of conflicts and problems now.&nbsp;My group is slipping away slowly and only a few notice it and yet we're helpless.&nbsp; It's sad watching your 1st friends in college slip away and knowing you can't do a thing about it.&nbsp; Next year should be so interesting to see who stays in touch with each other seeing hardly anyone is living together now.&nbsp; Housing seriously breaks up so many friendships; they really need to find a better way of doing it.&nbsp; I hate how we have to decide so early...who honestly knows who they want to live with next year in December?? (That is just whack and they all know it!)
&nbsp;I really need to sleep of this mood I'm in that's for sure.&nbsp; I think I woke up on the wrong side of the bed because I've been in a bad mood since I woke up.&nbsp; I just can't stop thinking that I lost him even though he wasn't even mine to begin with.&nbsp; I need to stop thinking about this but the hardest part of moving on is not looking back, something I have trouble with
