The latest news. Yes, what is the latest news...

Well, my brother is leaving on Monday, staying at Baltimore for a night and then taking a plane to Illinois (I think) for boot camp. I am so sad about this. Maybe I shouldn't be; it's not like we are that close but it still makes me really sad. I'm not going to school on Monday because I want to be with him the very last day he is here and I'm going to watch my mom shave his head. (Hehe)

Jessey wanted me to go to the track meet tonight because she's on the track team and Josh usually goes and watches them. Josh was my ride. I tried calling him after school but, of course, he didn't pick up. He did come home for about a minute if you count coming home pulling in the driveway, sitting there in the car smoking for a minute, then leave and turn back to where he came from, then yes, he was home. I was on the balcony and I wanted him to come back. Did he? No way. I saw him drive past the house with Devin (I am pretty sure it was Devin.) I thought I was actually going to be able to go! Ha! Of course not! Why would I get to go somewhere I wanted to? (Now I'm just bitching)

I guess I was being pretty immature, maybe, because my mom could tell something was wrong when I got home but I was all like "No, nothing's wrong, blah blah." When I finally told her, she offered to take me but I didn't want to bother taking me over and going out of her way out of pure pity, I'm sure. Mom or not, it was all pity. Now I'm just getting pissed off thinking about it. Hopefully I can hang out with someone tomorrow. Yeah, hopefully.

On that last post I made, I shouldn't have made my mood "lonely" because I have Louie and Alex. My best friends! Ah, but that kind of makes me sad because my best friends are cats. They don't judge me, though! And we never argue. Hell yea! God, I'm so damn sad right now.
