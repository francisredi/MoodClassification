Lost and forgotten?
Here I am standing in the middle of a cross-intersection. What lies ahead of those paths is unknown to me. There are even no clues or if there were, I never bothered to look much less look underneath the underneath. There are no assurances that what lies is good. The only way to know is to tread down one of the path. Am I ready? There is no turning back as I don't have the power to turn back time. Do I have the courage to move on forward even if regrets weigh me down? Is there an easy way out? Damn. I wish I have a map or a compass to point me to the right path. I wish...I wish... I wish...

Here I am standing in the middle of a cross-intersection, lost and confused. I have been here standing for quite a long time now. And I also have been lost and confused for a longer period than the former. 

Here I am standing here everybody and everything including time, passing me by. A lone figure hopelessly trying to choose which path. A solitary shadow hovering between despair and hope. A person who is now only a shadow of her once confident and determined self.

Here I am standing and will continue to stand for awhile and as seconds tick by my chances of being forgotten increases.

Here I am standing and oh, when will I start moving?
