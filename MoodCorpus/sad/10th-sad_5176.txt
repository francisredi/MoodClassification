Ewww
Ewwww, my math midterm was gross. My fucking french frog of a prof managed to make easy stuff hard. There was no divergences or curls of functions, and instead the fucker gave us some nasty ass proof and an ambiguous circuit question, that really had nothing to do with the circuit......i hate math.

And ewwwww, i feel soooo fat now. I ate a huge dinner before the test. I had a grilled chicken breased with boiled spinach and cabbage. I was worried about getting hungry during the test and then not being able to think straight. I also  saw Paula the other day, and she looked so skinny and awesome! I hope she didnt see me in all my fat glory. 

Omg, I just want to be skinny. Thats all I want. I'm trying to accept myself and accept my figure, but I cant!!!!! I look in the mirror and want to cry. I hate this.

I limit my food, I diet, I exercise, and I scrutinize everything! Why am I still such a blob of shit. All I've ever wanted was to be skinny.

I feel like an idiot for fucking up math, and I feel like a fucking huge pig. Oh my lord, I need help. I hate life, I hate myself.  

Here's a Kate Moss Pic (i don't know how this is going help morale or self esteem, b/c the girl is gorgeous and skinny, but whatever)
