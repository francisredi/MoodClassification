Who am I?
I am a bitter, pesemistic, sinical person. Why? I can't blame it on anyway...I made myself be like this. I've been thinking lately that I'm not really like this, but because I've pretended for so long, my thoughts have turned into reality. I guess if you think something hard enough it really does happen. Sometimes I'm so about being different and an individual that I forget about the things that I want that everyone wants. Sometimes I just say that I want different things to iritate people...it works too. Admitting that I don't want to be alone is scary because I don't want to be disappointed if that's what happens...I don't want to be alone. I don't want to be alone. I don't want to be sarcastic anymore. I don't want to be jelouse of other peoples' happiness. I don't want to be mean to my sister. I don't want what other people say to influence me. I don't want my work to get to me. I don't want people to comment on this lj. I don't want to not say what is in my heart. I don't want to push people away. I don't want to walk away myself. I don't want to not live up to my full pottential. I don't want to be scared of living. I don't want to be scared of getting hurt. I don't want to pretend. I don't want to not cry. I don't want my heart to hurt anymore because of all the stupid things I do or don't do. I'm just going to live, and try to be me, and not someone else. I just want to live.
