=(
Aladdin's over. I hate it. I'm usually not this sad b/c ya know...school shows arent sad when they're over because you know you're going to see everyone in the shows. I miss the genie. He's adopting me...but still. He told me to call him as soon as I find out what part I got in Urinetown so he knows whether or not to write an angry letter to Pilgreen. What a cutie! His wife was pretty okay too. She was excited about adopting me and forced Barry to admit that they have a futon so I don't have to sleep on the porch, which was pretty decent of her. I started to cry when I said goodbye to people and Barry told me to stop because he couldn't stand to see "to whom it may concern" cry. So I stopped. But I am sad. I didn't say goodbye to any of the guards hahaha. They'll be pissed but whatever. Apparently Main Street Theatre's doing Sound of Music in the spring, which is totally awesome! I SOO want to be in that. And I said goodbye to Scott and he said that he has already started looking into doing "Yours Anne" next season because he thinks it would be a perfect "vehicle" for me. I don't really get what that means...but oh well. lol. That would be so awesome to do! I'd be thrilled! But I'm mondo excited for Urinetown. ::is excited:: Once it starts I'll be a lot happier!
