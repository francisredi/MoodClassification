all new bridges to cross
I wish that I could go back to a tyme when the biggest decision you had to make that day was whether or not to do your homework.  I want to do what's best, but frankly--I have no clue.  I can hear the couple down the hall fighting about jealousy.  I heard a couple outside last night fighting frantically b/c she had cheated on him.  I woke up this morning for the first tyme in a long tyme next to the only person that I can truly talk to openly.  And now he's gone and some people have no clue what its like to be this close to someone that you can't even see.  A lot of people do and for that I am grateful.  But he's my best friend and it kills me that he hurts.  All of his friends are up here.  His GPA was higher than mine.  This is an engineering school.  And his father said he wasn't worth the money to come up here.  So me, the underachieving lazy 2nd class student gets to be here to draw shit for engineers and speak spanish.  I should be the one stuck in that stupid city.  Although this place is worse than Indyfuckinapolis, I still have my friends here who I live with.  

so I don't know what to do.  there are things I can do, and there are many things I can't.  i just pray that the rest of this semester isn't as painful as the last, b/c if it is, im not sure how I'll be able to get through those things alone again.  i can't deal w/ my family.  i can't go to any more funerals.  im not sure what to do.  

NOTE:  this is nothing against anyone I am friends w/ up north.  I love you all.  Its just that he's in the situation w/ me.  nothing more, nothing less...
