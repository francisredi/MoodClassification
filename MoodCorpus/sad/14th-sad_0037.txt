God Im Tired
Today..... it was harder to get up today.  But i still did, didnt want to, but i did. Im feeling lonely today.  I feel like making love to someone, but i know thats not gonna happen.  I would like to think its the same thing as being horny, but it really isn't.  If your just horny, you can take care of that by yourself.  Eh, but even that is never as good.  Best thing to do is not the think about it, and the last think i really want to do is masterbate.  Its tuesday, it looked grey outside, then again, it was still dark, so i couldnt tell.  I doubt i'll play softball today.  So i wont get my hopes up.  I have 8 hours to look forward to here at work, hurray for work.  I'll just read my book and hopefully write a little in my journals.  Still not sure why im writing in this today.  I guess because im bored and have nothing better to do.  THis is the best journal i have ever kept.  Why give it up right?  Im just glad not too many read it (if anyone reads it at all anymore).  AH well, another day of trying to figure out what to do in my life.  Trying to find a fixed routine that will help better myself in this society.  How boring, I rather be sleeping.  Till next time.

Thanks For listening.
