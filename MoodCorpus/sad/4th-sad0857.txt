my thoughts
First i want to thank everyone who has sent me a message of support or sympathy or hugs  lisey sally and Tristan it means alot to me, many people will avoid me as they find it difficult to talk about death for fear of being clumsy or something bt its comforting to know people care.
Secondly i want to say not preach - that i realise life i s definately what you make it, my grandad was born in ireland and immigrated over here and worked, had a family and died peacefully in his eighties with his wife by his side not an intresting story or an amazing one but he made the most of what he had.
People are so busy hating other people, being jealous for no reason, agonising over the stupidest things when really what is the point why waste some much time being negative when we are mortal and should be spending as much time as possible enjoying our families and friends not being cross with them because we think they are being unreasonable.
i had not seen my grandad in over a year and thats what hurts the most i have been so busy being me that i didnt take the time to see someone i loved so much, what a bloody waste.
So you may think im talking a load of shit or that im hypocritical but i dont want other people to feel like i do ever.
