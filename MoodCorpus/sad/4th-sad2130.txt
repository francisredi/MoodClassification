what a way to kick off a new year
spent the past two days of this new year... pretty much in bed or otherwise prone on the couch, floor, etc.

I really don't know, but I got really sick starting at about 6am on January 1, and continued til about 6pm on January 1.  I really didn't drink enough to warrant that kind of sickness, I think it was something I ate.  Or didn't eat. *shrugs*  I woke up fully in my sister's bed at 4:45pm.  What?!  So all I did yesterday was manage to go have dinner with my family at Benihana.  Went to bed and woke up this morning around 9am hoping to go running.

My back was aching kind of dully but I thought I'd be ok.  I started to get dressed to go running... and the dull ache became a stabbing pain.  I was forced to lay back down with the heating pad.  Well, it was still excruciating after an hour, so I called to warn Ronda that I might be late.  She told me not to worry, because Cece was coming in for the same shift as me.  I was determined to make it though, so I settled back onto the heating pad.  No luck.  Noon and I was still in hellish pain.  So I called her back and she told me not to worry that they'd be fine, so I just laid on the couch with the heating pad, popping Advil at the prescribed intervals.  I was really going to still try to make it in, but I don't want to be useless @ Kendle tomorrow.

Speaking of which, I ought to climb back in bed.  Gotta be well rested and ready for change... :)
