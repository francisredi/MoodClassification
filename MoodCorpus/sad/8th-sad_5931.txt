R.I.P Sally
On Saturday (4th of February) I got a phone call from my mum and she was sobbing.. my heart sank.. reluctantly I asked what was wrong, she said that Sally has kidney failure which was due to the medication we had been giving her for her illness. She said that we would have to put Sally down and we were to meet at the lort smith at 5:30.

I arrived about 1/2 before anyone as I could not stay at home any longer. She was staying there so I went into the care unit and as soon as I saw her lying down in there I burst into tears, the vet nurse walked out of the room and gave me some tissues then left me to hug and say 'goodbye' to sally. Its stupid, how can you say goodbye to them??? Then mum and dad walked in, we took her off the I.V drip to let her go outside, where we saw michael (my brother) so we all had a hold, then the vet came outside and said "are you ready?" Fucking stupid question! Anyway I held her as we walked into consultation room 8. He put the green lethabarb where her drip was attached, mum, mick and I were crying whilst dad tried to stay composed. I kept whispering "im sorry baby, im sorry, i will miss you" and mum was saying "Im sorry, we did all we could, we just couldnt get you better, this is for the best" Then Sally let out a big sigh and started to go limp, I gently put her down on the table as we cried more, the vet checked her heart and said she was gone, he walked out to give us some time with her. I just kept kissing her and patting her, mum was asking me to check she really was gone, she didnt want to believe it. I took her collar off, I still have not been able to go out without it, i guess its just my way of grieving, when im ready I will leave it next to Abby's collar. Then with one more kiss and me whispering "I'm sorry, I love you" we walked out, leaving her on the table, closing the door softly behind us.

I cant believe she is gone, our hearts are broken, she lived for 10 years, but for her breed, they live for about 15. I have cried every day since and have cried myself to sleep saturday and last night too. Its hard, there is nothing I can do to make me, or my family feel better.. All I know now is she is in a better place and feeling healthy again.
&nbsp;
Rest in Peace Sally, Im sorry and I love you.
