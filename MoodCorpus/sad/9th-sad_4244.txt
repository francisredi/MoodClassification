Hello everyone. It's with a heavy and very sad heart that I make this post. My grandfather on my moms side passed away last wednesday at 2:30 am PST. While my family is devistated by this tragic loss in our lives, we're trying to console ourselves with happy memories we have of this very loving man. We loved him very much and he never waivered in his devotion to his family. His lifes work was gardening and he loved his job with a passion. I never did have a green thumb and when one of my poor plants seemed sickly I could always call him and medicate the poor thing before it died. He was a hard worker and worked until he was too sickly to go out and plant flower bulbs and mow lawns and lovingly tend to the plants that their owners couldn't be bothered to care for themselves. He was a wonderful man with many talents.&amp;nbsp;He was maried to my&amp;nbsp;Nana for 48 years until his untimely death two days ago. He was 68 years young. We&amp;nbsp;will always miss him and his death has left a hole in our lives that only he could fill. We love you Grandpa and&amp;nbsp;until we meet again.... I hope you find joy in tending to the gardens in Heaven.
