Last day of Fall?
Just come home from my final class of the semester.  The falling snow looks so beautiful and I know Christmas is almost here.  So much quiet, lonely, sadness fills my heart.  I think of all the time that was lost that could have been spent with Candace this fall.  I had so hoped, even after she broke up with me, that we would have time together to strengthen our relationship, rekindkle the romance and enjoy hanging out, studying together and having fun together.  All that never happened because I lost my focus, my confidence and my patience with her.  I hurt her feelings and scared her out of my life forever.  I lost my  best friend.  I lost the hope of a temple marriage.  I lost hope to be truly loved and wanted by someone.  

I'm more in love with Candace than ever because those hurt, angry and jealous feelings that poisoned our love are gone.  As my eyes see more clearly what I lost, I remember all her sweetness, all her affection, all her attention.  I miss her voice on the phone.  I miss her being with me to comfort me when I was down on myself.  I miss all the fun I had with her and Scotty.  I really miss her so very much, and I wish I could let her know just how special she is.  I am so ashamed and humiliated by the hurt I caused her and wish I could make it go away.  

Lord, if you're listening, will you speak the truth of how I really feel to her heart?  I pray she'll forgive me, but first I need her to understand just how much I love her, and want her to be happy.  Maybe I don't deserve another chance, but at least give her a chance to be happy, please.
