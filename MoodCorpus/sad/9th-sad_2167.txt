Randomness
I feel very melancholic. And I wasn't sure why at first. I just thought it had to do with the turmoil I feel over the whole college decision thing, or about how I still haven't read the government articles that I was supposed to have read by yesterday morning. Maybe it was Physics or the fact that some teachers at my school are completely ridiculous and shouldn't be allowed to even step foot on our campus. Or just the fact that I feel lonely. And then I realized what tomorrow is. February 8... The anniversary of my grandmother's death. I also realized that's probably a big part of the reason I didn't go with my mom to my grandfather's today. Blah. So I can expect a very unpleasant day tomorrow. At least from my mom. She can get very depressed, and I can't blame her. My grandmother was a pillar in our family. It was a huge blow to the entire family. I miss her alot. And it just breaks my heart that I'm so close to graduating high school, and she won't be there to see me do it. She won't see me be the first to go off to college out of our whole family. She won't see me graduate college or get married or have children. She never got to meet Eric. She'll never get to see me do something great in her honor. She was such an amazing woman. God, I hate cancer. I hate doctors. I pray that one day I can cure that awful disease. That's my life goal. That's why I want to study genetic chemistry. So I can try to do some good for this world. Sigh. I'm just very emotional right now. I think I'm gonna go sulk or such now.

The end.
