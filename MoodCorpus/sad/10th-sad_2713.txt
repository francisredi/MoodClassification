i have been doing some thinking as of late. I realized that i'm a loser plain and simple. with that in mind here is why. . . 

1. I'm not as smart as i think i am and i'm now just realizing it.

2. i'm not much of a talker cause i've always been alone wth no one eato talk to

3. i always mess something up in other words i can't even talk to a person of teh opposite sex

4. as mean as people are to me about what they say its the truth and i hate to accept it

am i meant to be alone for teh rest of my life???? why am i always treat diffrently wh yam i the one people use and abuse? is it cause i'm a kind person taht if you ask me to do something i'll do it? what about the people i loe an would give my life for,i know there my friends but would they do the smae for me???? what ave i done to deserve a life like this why musti be the person who gets thrown around like a ball tossed back and forth like i'm nothing.

is there meaning to my life? What will it all come down to when it ends? will anyone care? what if i died know who would come to my funeral? who would shed a tear for me?

i'm not worth anyones time. . . . . . .
