Wow.  Things are going great right now.  First off, I have a Calc test that I am scared of, and then I need to run off to work for a double shift on another "Pointless Sales Week-end" day 1.  It is going to be a very long week-end.  But already I'm reeling from heartache.  Basically, what happened last night was that there was a piece of information that both of us shared (but to our different degrees) and that really hurt me deep, and what's makes things worse was when Daria shouted at me that she wasn't my girlfriend and that we weren't in a relationship.  It just really hurt deep because I had been working so hard at trying to re-establish one and put a lot of time and energy into trying to get one going again, and things were going really great, but then it all came crashing down and collapsed onto my hope and heart, crushing both.  And today is a "Jake" day for her, which makes me feel really sick at my stomach and almost makes me want to throw-up, but my stomach still keeps it down.  I just don't know what to do now.  I feel that my hope has been crushed and that she isn't there for me on the deeper level as she doesn't want to have a relationship with me.  What do I do then?

But, I am proud to announce that my astrology is coming along.  I was able to guess which house my brother's Uranus was in.  4th house cusp.  Not shocking at all.  That means that is a powerful influence and that his home life quickly changes in a heart-beat, which it has a few times now since I started college.  *shrug*  Just kinda enjoying that.

*sigh*  I just don't know what to believe in right now.
