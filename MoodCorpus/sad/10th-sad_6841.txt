I'm having a bad weekend and I just want to leave, I'm taking my test a week from now and I don't know where I'm going but I just have to get away for a day. I hate everyone at my school so much, their so cold and insensitive, sometimes school reminds me of the hospital only you don't know if you're really safe at school. at the hospital you know you're safe, all you have is your room mate. But I don't want to go back, last time I had Dan and Lyndsay, the next time I go I'll be alone, I hate being alone. When Jackie went home my dad yelled at me nd said I hd no reason to be acting so stupid, he's been saying this to me since I was little and you know what after a while you start thinking that it's true. That you really are shit, Jaquis is right, they've told me thousands of times but it wasn't until yesterday that I realized that they're right. I'm a failure at everything. I have maybe four real friends and even those friends probably don't want to be around me. I cryed all last night and now I have a really big head ache, I hope Jen and Jaquis and Jackie don't hate me. I love Jackie and Jaquis so much, they are the only people I've ever been able to talk to but now I just feel cold and alone. I'm isolated and no one bothers to ever call me because its true I'm so pathetic its sad. I hope Jackie still can sleep over on Sunday I miss her and we've only been apart for like fourteen hours. I'm so stupid.
