Still Insomnia
Not surprisingly, I'm having trouble sleeping tonight.
The passing of our dog is still weighing really heavily on my mind and I think everyone around here. The whole family could be sitting around, but none of us can really say anything. This morning I woke up at 9, but lay in bed till 11:30. I didn't want to get up. I couldn't deal with the thought of seeing my dog dead. But in the time I was there in bed, a guy came around and picked up the dog. My brother and parents thought it'd be fitting to have a service.

So it feels like this is the only outlet for my thoughts right now. I don't think anyone around here really wants to talk about it much. It's just such a depressing topic. (Yeah, I'm aware I'm talking about it now... but it's the only thing I can think about.)

I was thinking about doing something for my birthday; but that was friday night. Things have changed since then, and I don't think I'll be in any mood to celebrate anything come this weekend. It doesn't really matter, because I never get excited over my birthday anymore.

But the thing that's bugging me the most at the moment is not exactly knowing the cause of my dog's death. The little bit of conversation floating around between my brothers and parents has lead me to believe that she didn't just collapse or go in her sleep. There's a sickening feeling in my stomach that she drowned in the pool. I think that's the most heartbreaking part; knowing that her death could have been avoided. She was weak, arthritic, and her sight and hearing were deteriorated... she didn't stand a chance. 

At the moment I have the courage to ask how she died, I just know I'll only get more upset if I find out my suspicions are true.
