i don't know how to feel about this
my grandma (dad's mom) isn't doing too well. my aunt called this morning saying that she is laying in the hospital and her leg veins have popped and are full of pus. her mind is also wandering and she seems to be forgetting a lot of things. this lady is about 90 years old. she has gone through about 3 heart attacks and two of her kids deaths. she was constantly on the move, never wanting help (until my uncle begged that she does need help around the house), and even just to go get some tortillas, she gets all dressed up. every time i see her she has a different hair dye, yet she hardly seems to have hair as it is. mom hasn't called dad at work so far, he's the kind not to want to go til the very last minute, which in my opinion sucks. i know he hates feeling sad and such, but don't we all? he starts to disassociate himself with us and we don't know why. it's understandable to feel sad and not be very talkative... i think somehow even though my dad is not the macho type, may feel that he needs to act like it. we're most likely going to end up going to TJ rather sooner than later. i have so much going on right now, and this coming week with work and my student teaching, but i can't just say i won't go because it sucks and i would prefer to go even though i haven't seen her for quite some time.
