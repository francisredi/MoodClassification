bored like you would not believe
Yes I am quite bored tonight.  Why that is I do not know really.  It is almost to the point where I would rather be at work.  That may come as a shock for a few people I know.  Me want to be at work rather than be at home?  wow!!!
There are other reasons that I would rather be at work as well.  Once again my parents are mad at each other.  I swear they get mad at each other over the stupidest things.  This time it was about a particular movie my dad wanted to watch tonight.  Apparently my mom ordered the wrong version of "South Pacific" for his birthday earlier this month.  When my dad saw it was the wrong version he was not too happy needless to say.  Well, my mom wanted to watch a movie tonight instead of the Olympics.  My dad suggested "South Pacific".  My mom said she would rather watch anything but that movie.  Well, my dad did not like that and again they are angry with each other.  Keep in mind my parents nver sent the movie back to amazon.com so they can get the correct copy.  They have to be so stubborn.  From what my mom said she has lost all enjoyment for that movie because of this stupid incident.  I know that she will watch that movie again someday.  When that will be I personally do not care.

OK now on to a different subject.  I am trying to cut down on my caffeine.  I notice when I am work I drink 2 cups of coffee there and 1 or 2 more at home.  Well, I am trying to drink just one cup of coffee at home in the morning and a cup or 2 of tea at work.  I think I am going to eventually switch to decaffeinated tea.  Well, wish me luck people.
