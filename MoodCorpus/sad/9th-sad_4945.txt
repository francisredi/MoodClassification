This has been a sad week. Besides Brandy-chan's mom, my mom lost a cousin, and a lady in our community who is very dear to me lost her husband unexpectedly on Wednesday. I attended the funeral today. Poor Mrs. Martha. I know it's going to be hard on all of them. It was a really sad funeral. When Jeremy got up to speak, it was gut-wrenching. His face was just heartbroken.

It felt weird being back inside of Pleasant Hill. I have personal and family reasons for not going back up there. But it felt nice at the same time, like slipping on an old sweater. I got to see Cisgo and John and Candice and Jeremy and Chris. I finally got to see Chris' little girl Deanna. She is a little cutie. She looks exactly like him. Cisgo chided me and told me I needed to come see her. I might do that. I feel like I barely know anyone anymore. Chris said he hadn't finished school yet. That surprised me for some reason. 30 hours. In all actuality, it makes me want to hurry up and finish my own bachelors and beat him. I had a small personal rivalry against him. I don't know why, really. I think it partially comes from some of the things my mom used to say. She doesn't remember them know, but you know they still irk me. It was always a comparsion from me to Chris or Melissa or Kelly. The last one didn't bother me because I adored Kelly and she was family. I love Melissa, she was smart and very open and always made me laugh. I think Chris annoyed me the most because he had something I always wanted. Now that I'm older I see how silly it seems. Chris is a good bud, and still is hysterical. You have never met someone who likes to gossip about his family more than him. He needs his own little cul-de-sac. He'd fit right into Desperate Housewives.
