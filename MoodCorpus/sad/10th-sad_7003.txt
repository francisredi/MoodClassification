what does it mean to be a loner? does it mean you prefer to be alone than with other people, or just that the people around you don't want to talk to you. i hate that i feel like both are happening. i don't want to just sit around alone all the time, but i also feel like that's all i feel like anymore. i don't want to talk to anyone. well, one person, but that's pointless. i feel, deserted. like no one cares. sure people care that i'm upset about something, but they make no effort to make it any better except to give me a hug and tell me to feel better. i don't need to FEEL better i need to BE better for things to be better. i hate that i don't fit in with my friends' friends. it sucks. big-time. i hate that people think i hate them, when i know they know i don't. i hate that i can't do anything about anything any more. all i can do now is sit back and wait for something, ANYTHING to happen. i'm too damn impatient for that. i need to do something about it. but i know that that will just make it worse. 

its horrible that i don't know what to feel anymore. i want to be mad, but i don't know at whom. its no one's fault right? so who can i blame it on. i can't be happy, its all too damn fucked up for me to be happy about it all. so i've deteriorated to being sad. i don't like to be sad. but ever since sunday, i have been. i think it all started when i totally blew up at trae at kim's party. i think that's when i started not acting like myself. i want to be me again. i just don't know how. 

now i'm crying and i yet again don't know y
