"I seem to be getting what I want lately.  I'm not used to that."  He said.  That's wonderful, friend.

I'm in this strange funk that comes as a result of having too much to do, hating classes, hating my job, and having one romantic misadventure after another.  Check: DF best friend, man with puppet, blind date (WHAT?), and who knows what's going on with this New Yorker.
I've gotten myself into a position of caring what happens in senate.  I find that infuriating.  Why couldn't I just take on one project?  Just one?  And not be any integral part of it?  Why?  Because sitting in the back seat just isn't me.  I need to learn to sit in the back seat.  God, this campaign is going to be incredible.  Maybe even history-making (hats off to my good friends in KIgnited).
I love Van Morrison.  And as I sit here listening, there are still articles yet to be read and written.  I'm on top of those handbills, though.  Because I always do what's important to me first.  What is important in reality and what is important to me are often at odds.  
I turn twenty on Friday.
And I'm going to a potluck, then to Hillel for a few hours, then to the DF party.  And I just.... man, I'm so tired.  It'd be so easy to get out of something if I didn't already love everything I'm doing.  Except classes.  Sometimes I forget how important those are.  I'd get out of them if I could.  There isn't one that I'm really excited about.  Five classes and I dispair each and everyone of them.
