It's been a while since I've been on this thing, a lot going on lately, and don't really care to take the time to write about my happenings...

But today is your lucky day.  It's been a rough couple of weeks for me, last week my friend John was in the hospital with renal failure, so I was up there most of my week.  But he got out this past tuesday, and he's doing much better.  My aunt cathy also got out of the hospital a couple of weeks ago, after her stay of over a month.  So that's some good news...

Now for the bad, this past friday my great aunt Pauline died.  So on tuesday night I went to her visitation and then I was thinking that I wasn't going to go to the funeral on wednesday, but while I was at work I started to feel that I shouldn't be there and I should be there for my family. So I left work at 9 and booked it home so I could change. I'm very glad that I went, I would have regretted it if I hadn't.  That was a really rough day, but it was good to be with all my family at the wake... Sharing and laughing, made things easier...

Not much else going on really, just hanging out being bored, working, and then hanging out being bored some more.  Not real sure what to do about some other aspects of my life, to confusing to explain, I don't even really understand the situation I'm in, but something has to happen soon, or I'm moving on, that's all there is to it.
