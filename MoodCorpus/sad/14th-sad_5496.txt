Yeah...thanks.
Although my heart is broken, I know that one day it will mend and heal over. I'm just sorry another callus will develop. I'm tired of all of these ideals in my head. I'm so naive, it pains me to imagine what my life will turn out to be when I'm older. And here I am again in the same situation. I would rather be forever alone than to experience the familiar sense of rejection again. I was alone and I was happy. I did not need to be reminded of how I'll never be more than a friend to anyone. Three weeks ago, I was alone. Three weeks ago, I was happy. I was content with how things were. I didn't need my hopes raised to uneccesary expectations. People say things happen for a reason, but this was nothing but confusing. I don't see the purpose of what happened, but all I know is I'm in the same place where I started three weeks ago, only now, I'm reminded of how undesirable I am. It's funny how drastically things can change in one day. The day after my birthday. It's just funny. But at least he was gentle about it. At least I have that.

I know these feelings with fade but my chest hurts right now. 

I may feel alone when I'm falling asleep, and everytime tears fall down my cheeks, but I know my heart belongs to someone I've yet to meet. Someday I will be loved.

No matter how much garbage you think this may be, I truly am sorry for not being better.

And that's just how I feel.
