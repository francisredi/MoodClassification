fuuuuuuuck
for some reason im in a really melloncoly mood right now. i KNOW i spelt it wrong but i dont have the energy or desire to fix it. my phone is dead so i need to buy a new one... thats about 200$,i need to put money back in the bank some time because i HATE taking it out and ending up with no money in there, i need money to go to boyne in two weeks and i have to pay for the send time i take the acts in aabout 2 months. thats over 400$ NOT including gas money or anything that happens with my car. i feel really depressed and empty. talk about emo. you could take one look at me and think that im one of those crying emo things. all i really want is a hig from jason. i just want a hug. not talking, no kissing, just a hug. or cuddling. i think that if i open my mouth something horrible will come out and the tears will fall and then the whole world will drown. i dont know why. i know this all sounds so stupid and it really isn't that big of a deal. i'm just overwhelmed i guess. i have a crap load of stuff to do tomorrow. i have to clean the house, do my hw, do laundry, and hang out with brit bc i've been promissing her all week. plus i haven't really hung out with her since about 8th  or 9th grade. i miss her. we are going to talk about the tattos that that are going to get some time in the near future. what ever. im going to go.

wow, that is one BIG paragraph. any english major would be so annoyed.
