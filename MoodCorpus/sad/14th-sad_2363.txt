I am so sad and there's no one to talk to about it. As much as I admire how unfazed and upbeat Ryan is, I guess I can't be what I'm not. And what I am is depressed by the superficiality and transience of friendships. 

How someone you hang out with for years and have great memories can suddenly turn on you. How someone could be so brash as to vandalize someone's door when they haven't done a single bad thing to you. And how rather than being there for Brandon, our.. his friends instead seem focused on magnifying his pain and anger. It is grotesque to me how hungry they are for drama, so much so that they will villainize me and encourage him to hurt Ryan and me. If Brandon himself hated us, it would be natural. Rather, these people who are not the least bit related seem eager to goad him, in a fashion reminiscent of a Jerry Springer audience, and it makes me sick to my stomach. Brandon and I were still friends, as were Brandon and Ryan. It was plain to see. What these individuals have done is disgusting. To destroy friendships as their form of Wednesday night entertainment. 

Maybe I am overreacting. After all, it is just a bunch of holes in a door, and some very insensitive comments. Sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me. But what I see is the few friends I have made here at UCLA warping into ugly,&nbsp;hurtful characters, who would devour the long friendship I would have&nbsp;had with Brandon for their enjoyment,&nbsp;though&nbsp;they won't even be around to see&nbsp;EITHER of us in two years.&nbsp;And it makes&nbsp;apparent an ugliness in the world that&nbsp;renders me yet more unable to trust.
