....
i hate that i sit here, sad, and lonely and feel like i have nobody.  I have no friends that i can call and talk to and they'll come over and be sad with me. I hate that.  I  hate that im lonely, i hate that i miss my friends SO much.  I hate that im more lonely than i let people believe. 

i hate that he's married. i hate that i didn't take the chance when the opportunity was given to me.  I hate that for the longest time i thought i'd be the one he'd marry and now he's with her. i hate that he found her better than me.

i hate that even though he's got problems, i still like him. i hate that he moved on so quickly, yet i can't. i hate that after i kissed him, i knew it felt right and i thought we'd be able to have a relationship.  I hate that no matter what he does or says i can't shut off my feelings for him. i hate him.

i hate that i feel like i can't be good enough for anybody.  i feel like for some reason every day someone is disapointed in me.  I hate that i disapoint myself.  and i hate that i dont know what to do to fix it.

why can't i just be happy for one day. i have a good life. why am i so upset.  and why can't i just come out and talk to someone about it?

i hate this.
