So, I'm officially lonely.  I decided to be somewhat social tonight and go to a coffeehouse event on campus, mostly because they were doing previews of Godspell.  I will miss the actual performances because I will be visiting a divinity school in Texas that weekend.  What I didn't know was immediately after that was a ballroom dancing night in the same building.  I decided to stay for even though I had no partner and had not dressed up like most of the girls.  They took care of the no partner thing (at the beginning there were like 6-8 unattached girls, all the partnerless guys got snatched up early, but as they taught every couple moves they had us move down three partners.  So we learned to salsa and swing and meet new people.  It was cool, but extremely depressing. I started feeling lonely at the coffee house because of all the PDAs I was subjected too...then...the dancing. Ehh.  Got to dance with an ex-crush (it lasted about a week until I learned he was a lady's man like no other) and smirk a little at the fact that he was worse than me...really really bad actually.  Heh.

*Sigh* Now I am back in my room watching the local ABC news coverage about the fire near the school. They keep mentioning its close to Transy.  A firefighter got burned due to a back draft.  Two of the four apartments in the house were occupied...

so lonely. so very lonely.
