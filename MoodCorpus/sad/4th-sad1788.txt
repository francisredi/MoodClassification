My dream on laptop continues...
Welcome reader, I wish you a happy new year 2006. 

If are interested in reading the sad story of mine that follows, please go ahead...
I had this dream on getting the laptop for my work (last year) which made me sad, so sad that I thought I will put this post up to remember it. 
A year passed by and I actually stick to the same chair, in-front of same monitor and keyboard... with very little hope that I will get a laptop to work with this year. Last year it so happened that I started of with some of the personal projects (which turned into personal-company projects), which made my time management across the projects bit difficult. I was feeling little sad by the end of the day, when I had to switch off my PC at company and hope to complete the personal-company project the next day (which I really don't like). This was actually making nights miserable. I had few sleepless nights, as the idea which was left unimplemented always stuck my mind and I have realized "it takes more than a paper and pen to put forward the idea". I am actually fed-up of redoing things (at home and company), this actually triggered the idea of having a laptop, which will allow me at-least to get the things completed or stop redoing the work on the projects...

This year I have made a resolution to stick to this quote:
"If you do not get the needed resource at the right time then consider it as useless."

I am not able to continue writing this post as I am getting bit more sad, let me not spoil the day. Thanks for reading the post.
