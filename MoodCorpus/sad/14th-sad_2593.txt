slowly
Maybe its just me being sick or the feeling of being buried alive in this basement or maybe its the fact that my parents seem to trust my brother more than me and let him stay home ... in his own room... in his own bed... while theyre in cuba while I go to stay at a friends but anyway it goes I think im getting depressed again.

Ive tried all my usual tricks for being happy again... music, singing, theatre, dancing, hanging out, anything good but its not working and I need some help and because of who I am noone knows I do cuz no matter how sad I am I always act happy so noone else will be sad so Im writting this here so that you all know because you wont get it out of me in person. 

I thought I was turning my life around but somewhere in the middle it snapped back and now im back where I started so I dont know what to do at all. I hate myself I hate my family I hate my life I even hate some of my friends and its making my life go back to the depression and no hope and no light and Im so sad so many things are going wrong ppl are getting sick, ppl are leaving, ppl hate me and I dont like it, noone cares nemore.

And if anyone who reads this decides that "omg Im worried for her, I think Ill tell her parents" dont do it, Ive had that done to me once...last time it happened my mum just got all pissed off and plus if I wanted them to know Id tell them myself so Im asking you all to please not do it because the only thing they'll do is get all of a sudden parenty which makes things awkward because theyre not like that then pay for some cheap therapist and maybe some cheap drugs and hope it all gets better which it wont cuz no matter how many drugs I take or therapists I see its not gonna change my outlook... they can try but it doesnt work.

So Im gonna leave you with that because when you see me Ill be happy happy happy with that fake smile and those fake words 

Bye
