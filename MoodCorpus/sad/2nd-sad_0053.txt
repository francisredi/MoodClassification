Well, my day!
So, today was a bit crappy i guess. I had a bio test, and im not exactly sure how that's gonna turn out. Jessicas bugging me to an EXTREME extent, i cant even say, but she isnt the only one, just the biggest pain in the fucking ass. Katie V is a close second, however. Well anyways, after school i had a bball game (our first home game) and it pretty much sucked. I was so pissed at the end, i wouldve bawled if i were by myself, and it was so bad that i had to choke tears to keep from crying in front of people, my team, and the last time ive cried in front of people was when lacey died and we talked about it in bball practice, so that pretty much shows how much i just hate to have people see me cry. Anyways, after that i watched the jv and varsity bball games, both teams losing. And now im sitting here, getting depressed, because i have so much on my mind. Basketball, school, and especially the fact that im pretty much a horrible person for the things i think. And i really hate it. I hate not being happy, i hate being crabby, and i hate having no one here to care, really. So thats the one thing i want for christmas. Someone who seriously cares, and will let me care back. Someone who i cant talk to about absolutely anything random, and who wont care. And sometimes i think ive found a person like this, and it happens to be a guy, who i believe i like, but thats partly why im such a horrible person. I dont even know if all he says is bs or not, but i like him. But, its pointless to make this person 'what i want for christmas' because its a total waste of time. But when i find someone who isnt a waste of my time, ill let you know. And, if it ever happens, itll be a loong time, i can almost guarantee.
