confused... 
im usually pretty happy, and go get em. not today. i cant stop thinking. i dont know what i want. im questioning everything. nothing feels right or good. i feel totally confused, and sad. today wasnt bad but it was filled with regrets,  what i should have done, what i could have done better... its sad. this time of year is always rough on me.  i want someone to take over the controls on my life so i can steady myself..  and its not gonna happen.  i want the pain to go away. i want the problems to work out, after all i have been working on them but its like a two step forward one step back deal... i have soo much going for me right now, its a juggling act. i know what i have to do to make it, at my standards, but maybe my standards are impossible to reach. im feel like good enough, or almost there, but i feel like no one sees it. should it matter if no on else see's it?? this is why i dont sleep at night. i keep thinking these stupid thoughts. and i need to sleep. so its 2 am and once again i am going to try to sleep, but who knows. most likely ill be up all night, and then go to work in the morning. maybe tomorrow will be a better day. i hope so. who am i kidding? its the bookstore.
