I wanna know, the truth, if this is how you feel
Everything's messed up. How can a month go from so amazingly good, to so amazingly bad. I feel like I want to cry. I promised myself that I would always look at the optimistic side of everything, the day I met Hilary Duff, because then I realized I fullfilled more than I ever thought imaginable. But sometimes, it's nice to give in and stop faking it this week. I'm sick of being unreal to myself. Now, so when I'm happy, I'm happy and when I'm not, I'm not.

I wish I didn't have to be surrounded by people all of the time. pressuring people. I can't handle it anymore. The fighting, the pain, the non-existent care. Everything. people are so cold-hearted. sometimes people are just plain stupid. and that brutally hurts.

I'm not understanding anything in Commercial Art, it seems like everyone else took an extra class of something or other, while I didn't ... I am VERY confused. Math is SOOOOO hard. I can't even describe how hard it is. My teacher is VERY intimidating and I hate the people in my classes too. History isn't as hard as it is boring and lonely. 

Whoever said school isn't hard, never went to high school.
