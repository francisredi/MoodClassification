Sometimes I hate my life
Well, my parents have done it again.  They've stolen my will to live.  I've gone from a complete emotional high to a slight apathy toward whether I live or die.  I'm not suicidal, but I'm at a state where it seems rational.

My parents sabotaged the Oregon situation.  Short of a miracle, there's no way I'm going.  They're insisting, financially pressuring, using emotional abuse and using emotional blackmail to get me to go back to school.  Then my mother went into one of her predictable tirades about how I'm sick because I haven't forgiven people (yeah, that explains the paranoia and hallucinations nicely), how I'm not going anywhere, and how I haven't proven I can hold down a job(every time I try to find a job, she shoots it down).  It's bad enough Dr. Wighman wants me to get a dead-end job, now they're starting, too.  No one is listening to me--I know that if I do that, it'll make my illness worse.  Carli's right--wanting better for myself than a dead-end job is not an attitude problem.

And people wonder why I'm not getting any better.  If I had some freakin' support and someone cheering for me, rather than a bunch of people saying I can't do anything, maybe things would be different.  But the sad reality is that I've got a bunch of naysayers trying to control my life, and because I don't have any money, there's not an easy way out.

I'm beginning to wonder what the point of all this is.  If the goal and expectation is for me to be a wage slave, I'm sorry, but that's not the life I want.  If the expectation is that I'll never be able to progress past part-time work, I'm not sure I want to be a part of that.  If all I'm going to get is more restrictions on my freedom, I don't want a part of it.  I want to be in control of my own destiny.  I don't want to spend the rest of my life subject to my parents or my doctors.  I would rather die free than live as somebody's pet or somebody's project.
