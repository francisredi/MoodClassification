 
bah, test tomorrow and im ljing. plus i promised id play Risk tonite. fuck the test. im a procrastinator by practice, and a good tester by luck/skill so i should be fine. eh, i actually had breakfast today, the one time i plan for hitting the sleep, but i didnt, and woke up got up and ate. surprising, for me atleast. 
idk whats going on, ive been feeling kinda empty lately, it may be the prevailing valentines mood only reminding me that i ofcourse dont have a girlfriend. not that i ever have had one during valentines, but listening to my roommate talk with his girlfriend everynight will kinda get to u. its not like i havent tried, but things never go my way. we sign for the apt on friday. thats good, also, my moms coming up on friday also. free meals, yay. im really unsatisfied about pops tonite, nothing worthgetting. always when i get the chicken sandwich im unhappy. tasteless bland chicken. just one of those days. i dont feel like doing anything, just kinda been out of it lately. and out of it i mean just out of place, lazy, randomly glazing out of conversations, lack of interest in anything. i try to make it not so obvious, but i cant seem to stop it. even now i feel i could fall asleep and not care anymore, but i still have like 5 1/2 hours left at this point. ill stop now, dont want the post too long, ill postt later
