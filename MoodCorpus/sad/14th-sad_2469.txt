Still alive...
I've been kinda lazy and too depressed to continue updating my journal, not that it really matters if I do. I've been thinking about death alot and the meaning of existance only to find the answer too depressing and leaving me feel like everything I do is pointless. I think I actually can sympathize with Marvin the robot from the Hitchhiker's Guide movie. Also I've been having problems letting go of my feelings for my Ex and after a somewhat painful talk with her today, I have to learn to accept the fact she'll NEVER want me back. I'll probably spend the rest of my life sad and alone, and who knows, probably dumped once or twice more seeing as how love is nothing like on tv. I'll probably fade into the nothingness forever to never exist again since there is no God, no afterlife or anything. To experience what death is like, is like experiencing what it's like to be unconcious forever, and since you can't experience unconciousness only what's before it and after it....you get the idea of why death is so confusing. People say I'll feel better if I believe in God and all that shit, but I know I can't. Believing in a lie to make yourself feel better won't simply work for me cause I'd know it still isn't true. Religion I find is something people choose to believe in to deceive themselves into believing life has a meaning and worth living when there is actually no point. The only real point to life is to live as long as you can and enjoy it while you can. I just wish I could have a woman to enjoy my life with...
