leaving
Well i know people don't read my journals and stuff and i just don't care i just need to say this so that i can get some sleep right now...

Today was a poulee function and we went bowling and stuff and it was a lot of fun and stuff and i found out that i will be leaving on monday to go down to North Carolina. then after that i will be going to Moussori. And i am just feeling so shitty and depressed right now! im leaving in two days and and tomorrow is my last day here because im leaving early monday and all i want to do is spend it with people i want to. So i got suckered into seeing my relatives on my mom's side who just annoy me and then i got to go out to eat dinner with my dad and stuff and then sometime during the day i want to hang out with lisa one last time becasue i really want to see her one last time! i really do love her :(.

So then i want to see if i can get someone to spend the night and tomorrow and come see me off tomorrow because it would mean alot to me! it really would!

im just overall depressed over this situation and i just want to quit feeling so damn lonely!
