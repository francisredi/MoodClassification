What hurts the most was being so close/ Having so much to say and watching you walk away
How the hell can people be so optimistic? Or even worse, perky? How can you look on the bright side of things when sometimes you can't even find the bright side? I am so fucking sick of trusting someone and letting my guard down just to get knocked on my ass. I'm sick of being hurt. I don't think I deserve it. I don't think I've done anything that karma needs to come back this way to me. I try my hardest to be a good person. I'm not perfect, but I do what I can. All I want in life is one thing. And it seems like that's the hardest thing for me to find. I go in with the best of intentions only to get burned. I'm tired of it. I'm tired of feeling like a fool. I'm supposed to be the strong one and I end up being the one heartbroken. There are people that get into relationships with good people and treat them like dirt, but yet they keep finding relationships to go to. I'm not that kind of person, but I can't find a chance to prove it. And I'm tired of the people I'm supposed to depend on being MIA. I have one telling me they'll call me right back, when they know I need to talk to them, and they don't. I have another one disappear for days at a time with no phone call. They all seem to get into fights with their phones quite often because they hardly ever answer them. The other ones seem like I'm just annoying them. Yes, I am aware that people have lives, but if I'm not supposed to turn to you, then who am I supposed to go to? I seriously could just commit suicide and it'd be days or weeks before some of them found out. I'm tired of this. I wish I didn't have to do time at Jeff State. I wish I could just transfer out of here and start over. It probably won't be perfect there either but I'll have a new chance at finding a more complete life.
