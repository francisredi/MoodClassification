Good Bye
This year has not started out the way I'd planned.  Death has claimed another member of my family, we're averaging about one a year.  Yesterday, it was my cousin Shelly.  I grew up right across the road from Shelly and I babysat her kids once a week for 3 years.  She was actually my dad's cousin, but my mom's  best friend.  In fact, she drove all the way out to Idaho in June of 04 for my sister's wedding, and my mom and step-dad are flying all the way back for her funeral on Saturday.  I don't think it's fully sank in yet that she's gone.  She seemed like the one who would outlive us all because she was too feisty to ever die.  She lead a rough life, but things were finally starting to look up for her, when  at the ripe old age of 36, she was called Home. My mom said it best when she said, "Once you get past the pain and shock of her being gone, you just have to chuckle when you think of Shelly."  She was loud, she was obnoxious, she was fun, and a little crazy, and she will be missed by too many people to count.  Shelly lost her son, Joshua when he was only two, and I'm not a religious person, but I'd like to believe that mother and son are reunited in a better place than this rock we live on.  I've never had any first-hand experiences or seen any proof that life exists after death, but Shelly's boyfriend, Andy, said that before she died she said "Look Andy, there he is."  I'd like to believe that Joshua came back to get his mama.  It gives me a little comfort at least, when so little comfort is to be found.  Shelly's passing is a reminder that everyone must die, it's just something we all have to accept, but it doesn't make it any easier.  Knowing that every one of our loved ones will eventually leave us is just too much to absorb.  I can't even find words to describe how depressing that is.
