Valentines Day
today's gay.  literally.  i am kind of upset.  i mean, not that i didn't have a valentine but that this is the first year i did not at least get a little brown bag filled with nice messages from my fellow yearbook staffers.  honestly, all i received was a parking ticket at 8:34 this morning- 3 minutes before i got to my car.  how rediculous is that- fuck those men with their little fanny packs on who have nothing better to do than to give me tickets.  on a side note- i am in the library and need to be studying, but i do not have my ap stlye book and i cannot do my journalism homework with out it.  political science is really stupid and i ccanot make myslef want to study for my test thursday.  my psychology test was incredibly hard today.  incredibly.  lucy leslie decided to fix my collar for me during the middle of my test.  i really do like her, even though she killed her dog.  o, and she is married.  as victoria would used to have said, alas! we found out she was not a lesbian.  i still think she might be. the rest of the week should be pretty laid back. history midterm is coming up.  well midterm in general is coming up.  i cannot belive that we are almost half way done with this semester.  sae's are so sketchy! sorry.  i leave for spring break in about 25 days.  it is going to be so incredibly redkneck/ trashy, but we are going to have a lot of fun.  i hope.  one of the girls going with us got alcohol poisoining last night.  stupid ass.  well, i am not going to do any homework it looks like tonight.  i guess i will go back to my room which smells of my roommates nasty ass food that he feels so inclined to bring back from the cafeteria every damn day.  and he wonders why i keep some damn fabreese in the room.  HE SMELLS!  this weekend is going to be fun.  i am excited about rachel and alex coming down-- barrett is going to get them wassssssted :)
