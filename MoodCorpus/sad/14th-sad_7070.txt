sad... still
I dont want Qianqiar to move, i dont want to be in a fight w/my best friend, i dont want to be alone in this world. If Qianqiar moves which she will, and marissa stays mad at me-because she's an ignorant bitch, i will be alone. I am backing away from life instead of embracing it. I only appear happy to most people because that is what they want to see, what i want them to see. I only let the ones i truely care about see me cry, who truely care about me. Even Qianqiar has not seen me cry who i love so dearly and we do truely care about each other, at least i care most deeply for her. I would drive to AZ in an instant if she ever needed help. I would get there some way some how as fast as i could. I dont even think my parents or brother has seen me cry since i was a baby/child except for the night i broke my ankle/but that pretty much goes w/o saying.(I had a compound fracture-where the bone pops out of your skin, 3 other fractures, 4 breaks, and dislocation of almost everything in my foot and ankle; i almost had to have pins/had surgery at 3 in the morning... yea fun shtuff) I also want a boyfriend. Everyone seems to have someone these days. To hold, to love, to cry with, to share those happy moments, and those intimate moments of silence where you just look into each others eyes, or the moments where you could just hold each other forever w/o ever having to say a word about how you feel. I want that. But Qianqian has that, i dont want to take it away. You have to move, its ur destiny to be with Von and live happily ever after. i just dont want us to ever grow apart and with the distance between us it is bound to happen even if we vow not to let us. So this was my rant. Thanks for reading, ummm... yea...
