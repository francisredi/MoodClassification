First, I know many of you don't have kids yet...
First, I know many of you haven't had kids yet, so I have hesistated to post here because I do have 2.  I have nothing to be sad about right?

But I did miscarry a baby Nov 28th and then the next day my father-in-law died.  My main question is, I think I am handling it ok and then I have a day like today, everything makes me cry, I get angry...how long will it take?  Is it normal to feel you are moving on and then move back?  Will I ever read stories about loss or hear songs I like (pretty much no matter what they are about) without crying?

How long does it take?  Am I normal? (my husband thinks I am nuts.  To him, we have two kids.  It was sad but it is over.  But it's not!  I wanted that baby.  I can't just forget him/her.)

Does it just take time? What would help?  And I have looked online and found things like, "List your blessings" but I still...I wanted this baby.  It's sad to me he/she is gone.  I know I have a lot to be thankful for (again, I apologize to those who have miscarried and still don't have kids.)

And how are you all doing Christmas?  I just don't feel like celebrating.  I am trying but thinking of Christmas mostly makes me mad.

Am I crazy?
