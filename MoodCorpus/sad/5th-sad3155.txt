So i am basically hopeless when it comes to certain things lately. One i have been avoiding cleaning my room which i usually always clean if i have time. Two i haven't been trying to work, which i should be because i need to. Three all the goals i have set for myself have been being postponed even though i have time to do them!...So i ask myself where is my time going. Well it is spent being mopey in my bed watching way too many pointless MTV shows, not even really watching it fully because i am always thinking. Thinking of nothing other than two things, first is how much i miss new jersey and want to be out there having fun and not being here and in school. Second  is a certain somebody who i just can't help but think about. I mean this is just terribly old now and i should be o so completely over this but it just won't work. I have already come up with an ultimatum for myself when it comes to this but it won't happen soon enough. Now these nights of doing nothing was realistically two nights but that is huge for me because i am never just doing nothing and i most definitely never have the time to watch tv on the weekdays. I just want to kick myself in the throat for being a stupid girl!!!!!!!!!1 I am not one of those I DO NOT DWELL ON OTHER PEOPLE AND I DO NOT AT ALL UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES ALLOW MY STUPID THOUGHTS ABOUT SOMEONE TO MAKE ME LAZY! So why now!!! why me !!! lol lets just pray for some solutions.......
