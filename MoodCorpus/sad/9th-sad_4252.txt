the wake
Firstly, I have to say that I hate wakes, especially when it's open casket. It's like a big party that's no fun, where everyone is sitting around uncomfortable and there just happens to be a dead body in the room.

Which, by the way, my grandmother didn't look quite dead, more like she was asleep and I kept looking at her out of the corner of my eye expecting her to sit up and laugh at all of us.

The day started out by sitting around in Dad's family's old minister's house, rememebering my grandmother for the service tomorrow. As I was sitting there, I realized I had nothing to say really, about what made her who she was. Becuase she was my grandmother, but I didn't see her often and we weren't close and I didn't really know her.

Then a little interlude at my aunt's, where I realized Dad is a stranger in his family. Because everyone else but us lives together in the same town, they're all so much closer. 

Thus, I felt like a complete stranger when I was sitting in the overly pink funeral home. I spent most of the time talking to my godbrother when I should have been trying to reconnect with my family. My cousin Meredith said she wished we were closer, and I got a couple remarks similarly from my other family. Uncle Kurt hugged me and told me he loved me which touched me, but made me sad at the same time becuase we don't even know each other.

I think the real tragedy is not even that she died, but that I didn't know her as well as I should have. That whole side of my family in fact. It's been about 6 years, except for the one time I saw my grandmother this summer. I'm grieving for my lost connection with them, I guess. And the worst part is, half of me doesn't care about not knowing them, and it tears the other half of me apart.

I need a good cry right now, but I can't seem to do it.
