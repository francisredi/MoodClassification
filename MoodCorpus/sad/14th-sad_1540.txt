Another celebrity death...
I was in the post office about an hour ago, waiting in the endless line, and half-listening to the radio broadcast that was supposed to alleviate the wait. And Normie Rowe, an Australian singer was being interviewed and I'm listening and he says something about how he was sorry to hear of the death of someone he'd toured with, Gene Pitney.

And I sort of blinked and had to put it out of my mind and do what I was there to do, but of course I checked it out online as soon as I could (just now).

It's kind of a shock, he was only 65 and in apparently good health.

I was never a huge fan, never went out of my way to buy his music, but what I knew, I liked. I have The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance on an album I still listen to (album as in record, and yes, I still listen to records) and a few other songs on various compilation albums and CDs. The most I ever really knew about him was what Marianne Faithfull wrote about him in her autobiography (including that he'd proposed to her at one point), and I kind of associated him with the Rolling Stones and classic rock and all that sort of thing that I'm a fan of.

I also just found out in the news story that he wrote one of my favourite songs ever, "He's A Rebel" which was recorded and made famous by The Crystals.

This is kind of sad to hear.
