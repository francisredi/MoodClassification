A day...
So, yesterday totally sucked. I spent 4 damn days studying for Audiology, only to feel like I sucked at it. In which, if I do not pass it, I have to change my major. I have cried my cries, and decided that if this does happen, yes, I will feel like a peice of shit, and like a total failure/loser, but I will be okay, its just fates way of telling me I really am supposed to be a sex therapist/professor.  I know. Also, today is the one year "anniversary" (I guess you could say) of Grandmas passing. Last night I cried a lot, in some ways, I wish I was home, and others, Im glad Im not. This way, I can try to get all my tears out, and no one will see me sad, and at home, everyone will be sad, and that will make me sad, and this way, only I know I am sad, and I dont have to be a burden on anyone else. I know, confusing. Tomorrow, I go home. YAY. Also, I find out if I passed Aud. Hopfully today is better that yesterday. Cuz, I definatly gave up Mt. Dew at the beginning of the semester, and I bought a 2 liter yesterday...I cant handle more mt. dew and stress. I have another huge exam tomorrow, and a take hom to finish today. So, on the agenda for today is studying, and finishing the take home. I hope all is well with everyone else, happy holidays!! Ill try to update over break. THere might be an entry tomorrow. Depends on how Im feeling.
Happy Holidays!
