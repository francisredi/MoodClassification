A few hours ago I didn't think I would ever get a chance to post on here this week, but thanks to my one teacher pushing our paper back a week I have time to do things again.  (Awww Tequila just "barked" how cute!!  I love it when the chinchillas make cute noises!)  BTW as far as I am concerned, Tequila is my valentine this year as she probably was last year too and likely next year as well.  I hate this day, it is evil for those of us who have not been "blessed" with a man.  Does this day not make you want to puke and go to the store and rip up all of the stupid little hearts and shit?  Well I wouldn't really go that far, but it does piss me off.  Just rub it in the single people's faces why don't ya?  Show us how lucky we aren't.  Some woman got on the bus this morning and was "bitching" to me about how she is single, and I was thinking "lady, you don't need to lecture me, I understand completely how it feels to be lonely and unwanted".  I won't let that slight problem ruin my day but I will say that I do think that this "holiday" is cruel if you aren't in a relationship.  Ho Hum

That being said, I haven't really had much going on lately.  Not much is new I hate to say, not that new is always good, but still.  I am happy that my teacher did put our paper off for another week because I need more time. I have a whole book to read this week and didn't need that too.  I am finally going to the dentist tomorrow evening for my six month cleaning etc.  My teeth eventually did stop bothering me (you heard about that enough I am sure) and they feel pretty much all better.  I will still tell the dentist about the issues though so he knows.  Good news I guess

And thats all I can think of saying for now.  I am going to go make some din din for myself since I am home alone this evening.  Yes, I am very much alone in oh so many ways right now.  Oh well
