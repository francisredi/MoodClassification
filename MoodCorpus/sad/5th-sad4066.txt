ain't no sunshine.....when horomones are crap
i hate that i am sitting here thinking about you, i hate that i smiled and missed you after looking at that picture. i hate that i am even writing about this let alone feeling it when im not supposed to be caring about you. am i deluding myself again? are you an addiction? or mabye just the situation? a wise man once said that every woman has the exact love life she wants. i have been toying with this idea because it has merit. but i cant understand why i would want to be addicted to relationships that fail. or make me crazy and miserable. because then i feel something? i hate that i go from thinking you are a complete waste of time to just missing your smile because that is not lust. i hate that i like your friends and am sure at this point im just one of those girls. i think i hate that the most. i hate that total and complete disregaurd. i hate that i knew this from the start. i hate that i care what these people think of me because i barely know them. god i fucking hate being that girl! so why the hell do i do this to myself? im not stupid enough to think that its because you have some magical power over me because you dont, any power you hold i have given you. so why would i do that? thats the key right there and i havent the slightest fucking clue. god i fucking hate that bitch. i dont even know why i just do. everything about her. she is the goddamn socks and it doesnt matter. fuck the socks i want to light them on fire. the bike isnt enough. maybe im not the bike. maybe i am the socks. sometimes i wish head trauma wasnt such a risky business becuase on nights like tonight a concussion would be so goddamn usefull with the exception of the no sleep part.  i want to go to sleep but im terrified of my head on that pillow and the thoughts that will arise. maybe i can sleep in my computer chair. hmmmmmm..
