Happy Birthday Faye
Today would have been Faye's 55th birthday.  We're going to go to dinner tonight at one of her favorite restaurants.  Trina wanted to release balloons, but I vetoed the idea considering the fact that we live on the ocean and what goes up must come down and I don't want to be responsible for any additional oceanic pollution.  Besides...Faye would have been the first one to naysay that idea.  In fact, she's probably pissed that we even put flowers on her site.  That was just Faye.

One of the coolest things about her was that it was so easy to make her feel special.  She appreciated everything.  I used to give her her gifts first at Christmas time just to see her cackle and gloat to Trina that SHE had gotten her gift first.  Last birthday I got her a pedicure.  She held on to that damn gift certificate for a months and then FINALLY went and got one.  She was addicted.  Her life was such that she'd NEVER had one before.  54 years old and getting her very first pedicure.  I created a monster.  She was at the salon as often as she could for as long as she could.

I haven't really posted much about her death.  It was hard watching a woman who was so strong waste away.  It was harder still to realize that her addiction to ciggarettes was still there even as the cancer it caused ate away at her. 

Today I will remember her sourdough honey bread, which as soon as she found out I liked, she baked for me on a daily basis.  I will remember our experiments with the dehydrator and our God-awful cranberry roll-ups.  I will remember her chewing the mechanic out for over-charging her "daughter".  I will remember her crying as she held Maddie for the first time.  I will remember her telling me that Chad was the only guy I'd dated that she approved of.  I will remember her laughing at our hangovers on my 21st birthday.  I will remember her giving me my first tool box.  I will remember her.
