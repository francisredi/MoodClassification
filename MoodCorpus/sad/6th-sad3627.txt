I said, on our broken path, that tomorrow would not come at sunrise. I would only know tomorrow by the dawn of your eyes, the rise of your voice and the begining of your smile. As distance fevered my memories of our passing I grew sick with longing. Standing cold and alone I find myself in constant night. With this, my skin grows pale. Changing hue as my life, you, pass from me. Never, do my thoughts wonder from you. Doting upon each hair, each breath, each lash, upon me, you ever did drop. I can no longer tell if I have you memorized, or if my mind has washed you over with so much light and warmth that you resemble that of the sun, more than yourself.

Forgive me shattered end, forgive me for remembering you. When our paths do meet again, and sunlight breaths life into my flesh, my blood quick to my cheeks rosying them, your vacant stare shall be my death. Silent arrows from your lips shall pierce my heart. Before you, I, a stranger will fall dead by your forgetfulness.


Peaceful, my mind hurries for an excuse for writing this. An abstraction of a feeling, for a collective lover/friend. Today my mind haunts me with silences. Memories of long pauses and awkward fidgeting. I know not why I find myself so disturbed. Only my wavered female emotions can be so placed for blame. What I lack seems well compensated by mood and passion. So sickened, my mind dwells upon imaginary losses and fabricated injuries. Which in the end, perhaps is better. Rather I play pretend than find myself grieving over my actual miseries. If that, I'd soon find reason enough to be hung by knotted bed sheets, collected string, for in truth who has the rope these days?

There are only Seven real stories that exist. Which is exactly why being a story teller is so hard.
