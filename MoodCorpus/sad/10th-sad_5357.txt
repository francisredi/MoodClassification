Well, here we are.
I suppose I should write in this fucked up little 'journal' of sorts. Sorry if this seems out of place, but it seems that shit has fallen apart. Since I doubt anyone will read this (and I don't really care if people do or not) I'm not really going to go much into backstory in this entry. Maybe later, if your lucky. Well, ever since my amazing sickness, shit has changed in so many ways possible, its about to make my fucking head pop. I haven't been home (Shawn's place in Boone) in ages and it seems so far away now, I almost dread going back. Its a pity really, things change so fast. I no longer have a band, my dreams of becoming and guitarist or vocalist put on hold once again as I'm snapped back into reality. Oh well, maybe its for the better. I no longer have a relationship, maybe thats for the better, but I sure as hell fucking doubt it. Why else would I be laying awake at night wondering if when I sleep, I'll just have that same shitty dream again, the one about how it was before I was sick. So perfect compared to this. I don't even really have a job until the 27th, when I can finally go back to work. It almost makes me wonder why? Why, I ask myself, is my life falling into this Abyss of self pity and 'shitty emo bitchings'that I loathe so much? What have I done to deserve this? I don't know, hell, I don't even really care. Maybe this is all just a hallucination from the drugs, maybe I'll wake up in the Hospital in Ames and realize that I've been asleep the whole time. Then again, maybe its time to face the fucking music and just live on with my life. I don't know, maybe I should ask the audience. Oh wait... shit.
