Eminem
Ok well first off Eminem just simply can not marry Kim. I mean he deserves so much better. They married in a lovely mansion with 110 rooms and I wonder what they did in all those rooms. I may sound completely obsesed with eminem but im not... well... Thats still not the point! Everone says they did it for Hailies sake. Well how is it Hailies sake if she has to spend more time with her cheeting drug addict suicidal mother? Kim already has another kid. Yes she got pregnant just 6 months after divorceing eminem. Thats kinda sad. Well ok I've been taking this from only one point of view. This point of view is also known as media and media sometimes lies and hardly ever gives all the facts. So if I reconsider this I guess it's just because eminem and kim are just in love and people do stupid things when in love. They met when they were at least 12. See Kim came and grew up in Eminems home wihen they were 12. If you've known someone this long it's problably really had to fall out of love with them. In the end I would still die to marry Eminem but I guess that's not going to happen any time soon:P Oh well... I wish him and kim and hailie and whitney and .. kims niece the best of luck.
