Another year.

Tomorrow could be quite possibly the worst day of the year. Because all of my friends have boyfriends that live here. They will bring them a bouquet of flowers at school. And take them out to dinner tomorrow after the game. But I will just go home. Because my Dan goes to college. I've never had a boyfriend do anything for me on Valentines Day. The best I've ever had was in 6th grade when I was dating Marty Lorentsen. He got me a balloon flowers and candy. That's the best I've ever gotten. It makes me feel sad that every Valentines Day has completely sucked, and again, it will suck once more. And it's not even his fault. He can't help that he's at college without a car. And I shouldn't be disappointed, I have no right to be. But I am. I am so extremely disappointed. And I feel bad that I am. But I can't change it.

I just wish that maybe something nice will happen for me tomorrow. Because otherwise, I will most likely be, incredibly bummed.



I hate being alone. Especially on Valentines Day. Boo.
