Life, and the general suckiness of mine, atm.
Work is cranking up. I'm going to need to put in more hours to get more done, and ~somehow~ find a place to live and move all at the same time. This strikes me as impossible. I have so little R&R in my life as it is, and what it amounts to is sitting in front of the comp playing CoV. I never see people because I am either to exhausted or cranky to be any kind of company. I quit the Wellbutrin that helped me quit smoking so of course I'm now depressed. All those doctors I saw last year are now hounding me about the bills because for some reason, my insurance company doesn't want to pay them. I don't have health insurance right now, but am supposed to get some, *rolls eyes* for some reason for all the bills they are paying. I started smoking again. le_cloitre took a picture of me today and my ass is HUGE! I must have gained close to 20 lbs in the last year and a half. It seems my cat may be the source of all the bugs that ate me alive last year, so I might have to get rid of my only and longest companion. My hands are blue from some spilled leather dye. I look like an agent from Blue Sun Corp. If those medical bills go to creditors, all my hard work to improve my credit rating is shot and I won't be able to find a place to live. If you think I'm exaggerating, I've been rejected already. I'm lonely, I'm tired, I'm pathetic, I'm fat, I'm broke, I'm sick, I can't spell 'perilous', and now, I'm a whiner.
