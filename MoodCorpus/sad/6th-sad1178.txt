its been a while since i've updated. -sigh- idk im kinda depressed today. new semester started two aps ew! i have colorguard and variety show and work and i still don't have a driver's licence and i still don't know where im going to college. im feeling kind of hopeless. it doesnt help that my bf is being annoying. he wanted to go to disney with his x bf of 5 years and i said i didnt want him to and he kept being all like i'm going anyway and ya. he said he wasnt gonna go he was just like "w/e" so i dont really know wtf hes doing. hes prolly gonna b annoyed that i wrote in my lj. lol w/e so i called him today and we argued about the disney thing and i asked about hanging out tonite and ya so he never called me back and i called him and his was out to dinner with stu. wtf. and like he bitched at me once for not telling him i was going to dinner for my stepmoms bday, but he can go out with his x bf and do w/e the fuck he wants. w/e im sooo stressed rite now. i dont even want to deal with a relationship rite now its too much. i cant deal with a guy who constantly acts like he doesnt give a shit about how i feel and constantly jokes around about on cheating/breaking up with me. i just cant handle that. im a needy clingy guy and i new his needy/clingy period was not gonna last. and i told him that. it always happens. it happened with david with justin and with jason. sljkghalksjghdajlkghdlkjghhg i think im getting sick. i have a show fri and sat excuse me for wanting jason to b there. he used to be all like "o i cant wait to see u perform!" now hed rather go to disneyland with stu. idk wtf jason is doing. he got home and said hed call me back. he still hasnt. w/e i dont give a fuck. he can go to disney i have more important things to worry about. peace
