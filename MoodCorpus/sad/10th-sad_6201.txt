Hm. 
I don't think I'm going to go to the Disturbed + Korn + hatebreed concert. I can sense it's going to be expensive, and even if it isn't I don't have anyone to go with ._.;

I'm not going to be allowed to go on my own, BLAH! so that's mildly annoying. I'm waiting for ticketek to get back to me about how much they'll cost. 

I've gotten through one of my three requests I had to draw, I'm not that fond of it, but meh. I tried my best and I'm not getting paid, so Liia will have to love it anyway. 



There it is. I wish it didn't look so anime like ._.; I'm trying to make it less anime-ish, but I seem to be failing. Oh wells. 

In a couple of days, probably wednesday I get to finally see Underworld 2! I don't care if people say it sucks, I'll probably like it anyways! XD Jebus I'm bored! 

Sometime this week I'm gonna go to Animecha and get Samurai Champloo on dvd. I finally got hooked on it, and just in the first ep, too. The fighting! OMFG and VIOLENCE! BLOOD SPRAYING ALL OVER THE PLACE! SQUEE! I was going to get the Count of Monte Cristo but I think I'll save that until I get an actual job...which probably won't be until I finish school XD! With getting to school and home again, it takes up most of my day and then I have homework, so I suppose I'll just have to wait. 

At least when I'm in year 12 I'll be able to drop a subject or two, since I already have three units from last year, that should give me plenty of time to get a job. I'm going to buy some transfer paper so I can iron a not so witty logo on the only plain tshirt I have >.>;;;
