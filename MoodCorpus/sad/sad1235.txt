I want silence
Today.  Well almost all of today was fantastic.  I had the privilege of hanging out with my best friend DC.  Then I saw him.  We were having a good time at Village Inn as always when I went into the restroom to wash my hands and then our eyes locked and immediately there was anger.  I wanted to punch him, scream at him, tell him all the things that hurt.  How stupid, lazy, and inadequate he had become.  Then again it would have been silly if someone had come in and saw me shouting at myself.  I don't know where these feelings come from, or why.  I just catch a glimpse of myself and wondered where I've gone.  Why is it so difficult for me to accept that I'm nobody special?  Why do I have to whine about it and sound like a little girl?  These emotions are getting in the way of my life.  It should have been an awesome week but depressed Steve came back and I've been craving my happy pills.  I cried today.  I haven't cried in months.  Fuck that.  Today I would have been in the Navy one month shy of two years.  I tell myself to stop living in the past, its just so hard because my future looks bleak.  I only update when I'm extremely happy or sad.  I apologize.  I've been sorry lately and I don't know why.  I haven't done anything.  Maybe that's just it....
