last night I hit rock bottom. I was more depressed than I ever have been before. I dont even know why
a lot of it was because my parents keep ordering me around like i'mn a dog, and whenever i stand up to them they just pile on more commands, and i'm sick of it. so yesterday i was really tired, and generally feeling like shit, and I dont have my radio any more because my mom took it (sadly, it will now sit, forever silent, on a corner of her desk. I miss you, my radio!) so i was generally pissed at her but then she tells me I cont go on the comp and check my email so i'm a nice little girl and I dont protest. but i'm tired, so I start to show the fact that i'm frustrated and then my mom wants to "talk" to me and she's all like "we're friends, right?" and more than anything I want to tell her that no, we're not friends, if anything I hate her more than anyone else alive, but I couldnt. and then I started think about my life, and I realzed that this is how it will ALWAYS be, no matter what, and I realized that I can't live like this. so I just broke down. luckily it was late, and nobody heard me. 
and now i'm just as tired, just as sad, and a little less irritated, btu I give up. i'll stop writing this, because i'm not making any sense and it doesnt even matter anyway. 
night, all
