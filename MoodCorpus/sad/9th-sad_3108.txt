Very Lonely
Do you ever feel that the whole world barely notices your presence, let alone your feelings? I can't help but think this when the days that I feel lonely increase.&nbsp;Surrounded in a packed room, but no one to talk to, right? Alexis asked me to the mall today and I helped her pick out a garder for sweetheart. The day was going pretty well until she brought up something from my past, and I didn't know it then, but it ruined my whole day. Usually my feelings of lonliness are on the back burner, but she put them on full blast in front. I was so upset, I didn't talk to anyone at my concert (which was absolutely horrible - Mrs. Walters' fault)... then after I usually always chat with everyone I can and eat as much as I can, but I bolted out of there as fast as I could. Walking to my car, I felt tears swell in my eyes, and when I got in the car they poured over my cheeks. I don't really have anything to be sad about. I have everything I need, my grades aren't too bad, my family is doing alright, but I always have that hidden sadness. Its hard to feel like you want to cry but can't because you don't even know what you're sad about. Maybe it's just PMS... I really can't tell anymore, its probably too frequent for that. Yesterday I babysat&nbsp;dad's 4 kids through the morning and drove them to school. &nbsp;The only strange thing that happened that I can think of is we were all locked out of the downstairs bathroom, and a couple hours later Kayla opened the door with ease (mind you, the lock is only a year old).
