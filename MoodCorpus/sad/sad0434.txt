people are strange.
i don't think i will ever understand people. or life, for that matter. it seems that as soon as things go right, they go wrong. and not just normal wrong, but flat-out crazy wrong. and all at once, too. i'm in the weirdest mood today, and i can't for the life of me figure out why.
it's odd because i'm very anxious about everything but i have really long nails, which is strange. i always chew them off. i know it's gross, but it's honestly my only bad habit. i'm in one of my moods where as soon as i make up my mind to do something, i no longer want to do it. i know it will pass, but it's annoying. but on the brighter side, there is a small rat jack repetitively running into me as i type this. he's playing with a cat toy and ignoring my presence completely. oh how i will miss him. i'm hoping that if someone responds to my ad in the paper, they won't live too far away and i'll be able to go see him sometimes, and make sure they're being good to him.

"looking back through time 
you know it's clear that i've been blind
i've been a fool
to ever open up my heart
to all that jealousy
that bitterness, that ridicule."
