drowning in self pitty

Somedays ill wake up and wonder...Is this as good as my life will get? Other than physically living (breathing, heart beating ect), does this really even count as a life? I have no real love life or social life. Work life? Yeah ive got one of those. Of course the biggest part of my job is developing pictures of peoples love life and/or social life. If i see one more happy girl showing her happy trim stomach while having happy sex with her happy boyfriend i might take a happy gun to my unhappy forehead. If this is infact a life im living, then...am i stuck with this? Crawling out of bed to check my empty inbox on myspace and hotmail...checking livejournal to read about everyone elses lives...grabbing (and a few crumbs short of swallowing whole) an entire cake and finally crawling back into bed where i will watch mind-numbing television until i fall asleep. Thats my "life" on my days off. Way to live kid! Way to live.

Go on. Tell me how this is my fault. Tell me that i limit myself and am anti-social. Tell me theres more out there and i just havent found it yet or im just not really looking for it. Tell me i can trust people to be my friends without the immediate thought that they too will simply walk away from me. They always leave. always. Tell me someone will love me and ill live happily ever after. Go on. Tell me.

I
am
a pessimist.
