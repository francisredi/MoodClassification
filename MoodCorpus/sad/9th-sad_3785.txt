Tomorrow, right after work, I'm driving back to Uncasville again.  This time for my cat's funeral.  I find the idea of a kitty funeral to be slightly twisted, but if I couldn't be there for her when she died I'm sure as hell going to be there when we put her in the ground.  I would have sprung for the cremation if I had known it was a money thing, but since I didn't find out until after she'd been taken home I couldn't really send her back for cremation.  They would have had to wait until the vet's office was open again the next day and by then she would have started to decay and, therefore, be a terrible inconvenience to that vet office I imagine.  No one other than I should have to go through an inconvenience because of my cat at this point.  I don't think it's entirely set in that she won't be there, happy to see me, when I get home.  I'm the only one she ever greeted...after the dogs went crazy of course...she was never a fan of throwing herself into that fray just to say hello.  How can I not have a cat at home anymore?  Sugarfoot is a great dog, but when I just want to sit back and relax she gets restless.  She always wants to play, run around, have me throw things for her to fetch and bring back.  When I just want to kick back my dog is not the animal to bond with.  Pudden was always content to just sit in my lap and have me pet her on occasion while I watched West Wing or something.  She was such a laid back cat.  =(  Midterms went well and though I told my roomie I'd try to meet her at the gym afterwards, I'm not going.  I'm exhausted.  I've been running myself on empty all week and I really need to just relax for awhile.  I think after the kitty funeral I'm going to have a kitty wake.  At said wake I'm going to get blissfully drunk.
