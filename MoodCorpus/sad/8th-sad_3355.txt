i could cry
all i need is to get out of here.  every weekend comes and i do nothing, theres no parties, theres no field trips, no nothing, our floor just sits and does work.  i dont have that much work this weekend and all i want to do is go away for a while.  i cant, however, because i have no car, and hardly any money.  

so im stuck here, wanting to cry bc i havent done something other than work in a long time, and i just want to do something fun with cool people who i enjoy being with.  but alas, im in prision

maybe i should go somewhere else, maybe i should be home for the rest of my life.  honestly cant remember the last time i smiled a genuine smile and didnt have to force a laugh.  all i want to do is have a life, but im here in my room, alone and bored out of my mind.  

i could meet new people, but after the first few weeks, people are so closed off, i swear this place gets to you and makes you not want to meet new people.  you only talk to maybe a quarter of the people you met in the first week or two.  im sick of just sleeping everything off.   i want to drink alcohol and be stupid, i want to see my bf, i want to see my friends, i want to eat real food, i want to not have to pay for poloroids and film, i just want to feel at peace.  thats too much right now though
