Sad Story
Today I was outside taking a small walk because it is sunny and I wanted to get some air. I was walking by the apartment building right next to the Renaissance. On the lawn there was a small puppy running around. It came up to me. No one was out there with it and so I picked it up. It licked me and I petted it. I thought, "It doesn't belong to me" so I put it back on the grass and it ran around. A man was standing a little bit in front of me and so I walked up to him and asked him if he knew who's puppy that was? The puppy was standing by us as we talked. The man said that he didn't know who's dog it was. I thought, "Oh God, the dog shouldn't be out here. There is too much traffic". I was going to pick it up. All of a sudden the dog ran onto the road. Cars slowed down and the dog kept running. He ran all the way to the other side of the street. The man started to cross the street. He was going to go get the dog. All of a sudden the dog started crossing again. I screamed "No, no". A car hit the puppy. Some men on the other side of the street tried to go get it but another car came and hit it. So they went and got it out of the road but it was dead. I could tell. I started crying because I knew I should have kept holding it and taken it to the office or something. I put it down, why did I put it down. I will never forget when the poor puppy was running on the road and a car hit it. I know I will have nightmares. I should have taken care of it because it was a baby, a small puppy. I am home now and I am sick to my stomach.
