Sigh
Well, it's been an interesting time since I last posted.  Abe visited Madison for the first time and got to meet a few of my friends there on New Years.  It was fun to hang out with my friends from home.  I'm just sad that I didn't get to see all of them.  It was a lot of fun to get updated on all of my friends' lives.  We've all got a lot going on and I haven't been in the same state as all of them for three years almost.  I love just seeing them again.

Now I'm back in Richmond for the Choir Tour (East Coast).  We have rehearsal today and leave really early tomorrow morning (breakfast at 6:30).  I hope that tour this year goes well and that I don't get sick.  It is no fun being sick on tour.  It's even worse because of the bus...  No stomach illnesses for me!  Please.

Now, for the real reason I'm posting.  Our cat died last night.  I had seen him in the morning and then left for Richmond.  My mom called me last night to tell me.  It didn't really hit me then.  I've been thinking about it since then.  I will never see him again.  I will never be able to pet him or sit next to him on the couch and just read.  I miss him.  He's more my sister's cat, but I still loved him.  I'm so sorry Erica.  It will be hard to return home without him there.  Only the dog now.  I wonder if my parents will get another cat.  Probably not.  I want one though.  It's like puppy therapy, except with cats.  Sigh.
