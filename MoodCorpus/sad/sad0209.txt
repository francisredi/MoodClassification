Lonely and stuck in the past
I've been in the wierdest mood lately. I kindof feel like (almost) all of the people I was close to last year and the year before are the same people I don't see or talk to now. This makes me so unbelievably sad. Is it really possible to be so close with someone, or several someones, then six months later not know anything thats going on in their life? Have they forgotten everything? All the hilariously things we did, soberly and not-so-soberly? I totally understand that they're living a whole other life than I am, seeing as they're attending University and I'm stuck in hell - oh sorry, I meant highschool. funny how i keep confusing the two.. - but fuck, this sucks!

All of this came about, by the way, because I started looking through pictures and thinking about the stories behind them. I.e. drunken times with the birth of Mikes' unborn tampon child. And now all i'm thinking about are the people who are constant in my life, who i've been friends with for years, and am still friends with, despite everything thats changed. But even with these people I don't have a group of friends anymore, that I can hang out with weekend after weekend, doing nothing at all and still having a hilariously great time. I miss that. Well, I guess my FW boys are a bit of an exception, I always have fun with them, on the rare times I get to hang out with them. I just can't believe that my life would change so much in less than a year. Each year of highschool was completely different than the years before it, which grade twelve being the shittiest of all (excluding this half-year obviously), just because it was like I was all alone. Granted, this was self-inflicted, I had no desire to be a part of the idiotic group due to them irritating me within 2 minutes.

God thats depressing. Am I depressed? I hope not..
