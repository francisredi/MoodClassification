bye 2005!
I wasnt going to post but was inspired by Kalaras post. 
2005 did suck.&nbsp;All the death and illness. 
&nbsp;My sister and I blew off Chanukkah, Xmas, and my sisters partner Gabes birthday(8Jan). Gabe said she would rather put things off and have a pool party sometime in July. It was sudden. Mother didnt feel well Thursday night and we called 911. She passed Friday morning about 10a. My sister and I and our fave Aunt and Mothers best friend Jan were with her. The funeral was Monday. We sat shiva for only two nights. Gabe, our cousin Allison, Chris, and Em, are so wonderfully kind and supportive. Could not have gotten through it without them. I called Em (JANE!)at her parents Monday evening and she DROVE BACK from Sarnia A DAY EARLY to take over house/dog sitting for me. Bless Em for being so understanding. She knew my mother well but understood that I just couldnt call her at her parents over the weekend and ruin her holiday. Chris also knew my mother well and Mother adored both of them. So, now that the social obligation part of it is done, my sister and I have appts this week with the accountant and the stockbroker and I have to go house hunting soon. I have no clue where I want to live.
