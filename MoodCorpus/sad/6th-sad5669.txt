I'll be offline for a couple of days...
I received some bad news on Sunday morning. My mom called me to tell me that my dad had passed away the night before.

My dad was 81 when he died. He was in full possession of his mental and physical faculties. He still skied every winter and golfed all summer. He was still active and energetic. His last day was spent with friends who were visiting my parents from out of town, and they had a lovely day. He fell asleep watching TV and just didn't wake up. If I could choose how I wanted to go, that'd be it... no slow decline, no lingering illness, and an enjoyable last day spent surrounded by loved ones.

So I'll be going to Ottawa for a few days to be with my mom and sister. One of my brothers will be coming a few days later, and the other will be coming next week, after recovering from knee surgery.

I'm sad, but not shattered by the whole thing. He lived a full life, and did not suffer when he went. I was on good terms with my dad. He came to my wedding, and was very accepting of my relationship and marriage to Caleb (aka ). I have no regrets vis a vis my relationship with my father. I can celebrate his life without being broken over mourning his death.

So, if I'm missing in action for a few days, that's why.

Take care, all of you.
