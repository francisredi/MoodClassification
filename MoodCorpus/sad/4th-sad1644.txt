...
We belong together
   like the open seas and shores
waded by the planet floors
    we've all been spoken for...

i wish that was my day i had a boring day starting at midnight guess what i did? absolutly nothing in fact i almost fell asleep waiting for the freaking stupid ball to drop i didn't even see it drop i was drinking my fresca and struggling to keep my eyes open...it was quite sad actually then after that i actually had to go to church even though there was like NO ONE there so oh boy that was fun...then we went to bruggers and stuff we took down the xmas decorations and then i was online for a bit before the rents are like were going to a movie in like 5 minutes i have now seen like 5 movies fun with dick and jane, memoirs of a geisha, the producers, cheaper by the dozen 2 and i guess thats it so 4 movies not 5.  but on january 13th tristan and isolde comes out which is where the song i am listening to is from you see first look at regal is on and in there they have the music video with gavin and scenes from tristan and isolde and so i love this song now and i just hope this movie will be good i have to find someone to go with me....tomorrow i want/ed to go shopping but i don't know if i will i don't have to go shopping but hey if i cash my checks ill at least have money to go shopping which is good enough for me :) after cbtd movie i was online again and had a convo that depressed me a great deal so now- we belong together is on repeat, i am wearing my glasses to hide my red puffy eyes and i am wearing my slippers and i just feel like curling in a ball in my room and let the darkness overcome me and i wish the moon would rise and kill the sun so i could just sit for a while and think...i need that...
