Death and Rebirth
I just recently received news that Skyler was killed by a drunk driver over the New Year's holiday. This is not the first time I've had to deal with death but everytime seems to feel like the first to me. I have decided to do this special post in his memory.

I forget at times that we are only mortals and only have a limited time on this earth. It still seems beyond belief to me that the person who has cheated death so many times has now been taken away thanks to some drunk asshole. But I'm not going to focus on his death, because I want to remember his life.

To me he was always what I wanted to be. An inspiration and something to aspire to. It seems so cliche to say he was someone who loved life, but in his case he truly was. He always lived for the moment, consequences or obligations be damned, and he always showed complete loyalty to those who were dear to him. If only we could learn from the example he set, "Life is far too short to sweat the petty bullshit."

I will always remember him and try to celebrate his life in the way I live my own.

He is now one step ahead of the rest of us in the cycle of life and one day I will meet him again. Until then my friend, my brother, "Ja Ne."

In memory of "Skyler James Hall" 1/26/1985-1/1/2006
