Said I'm So Sick Of Love Songs So Sad & Slow, So Why Can't I Turn Off The Radio?
Well...I guess things are sooner or later going to get better...Besides from being told that I'm crazy/manic depressive. I started my anti-depressent drugs yesterday. They made me yawn ALOT. I can't wait to start counsling just to get better. I'm so sick of pretending I'm happy. I just want to be happy. I'm all honesty I'm so sick of feeling so overwhelmed, like I don't belong. I'm realy for all of those feelings to go away. 

Things with my dad are much better. After we had our little crying fest together, we talk daily and I don't have to force him to tell me he loves me anymore. Things at home with my mom and step dad? Eh I don't see that ever changing but it's something I'm getting used to and learning to deal with. 


School, well I had to quit the dance team because I start night school soon and I wouldn't have been able to do both. I really miss it, and am really dispointed in myself that I had to quit. It's also a must that I pass 5th hour, if I don't it's two night classes a week and down $240.00. I hate myself for being so stupid. 



xox,
Nicole
