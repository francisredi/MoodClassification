nothing i can do.
I went to Eureka and visited my madre. It sucked. Seriously they didn't last like 2 hours without fighting and I had nowhere to run away too. I was so glad to be home....

I can't wait to get out of this stupid town. I am a little drunk right now but it's nothing I couldn't say sober. I hate the way everyone just can turn their feelings on and off. Everytime I think about Kim/Daniel/Kyle/Jen I practically end up in tears. I don't really know what I did to cause them to hate me. And my only other group is misael/megan/guy but guy is being a totall dick to everyone so I lack the want to hang out with them as well. Brandon is pretty much my only real friend up here and he has other people to be with. I'm pretty much just lonely I think. Everything is so superficial, which I don't really mind, but I hate when people pretend its not. I'm ready to move on and make more real friends. Becuase I sware I've only met one worthwhile person the whole time I have been here. And that sucks. I miss Whitney. I miss Tasha. I miss simpler times and simpler people.

I fell asleep watching tv and Brandon had left! And now I'm drunk and bored. I though these were the best years of my life.
