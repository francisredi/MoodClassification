My first entry in Ambridge. (!_!)
It has been a long time since I had a new entry. Atleast a month ago or maybe a month and a half. I truly do miss it over there at Aliquippa. There are so many loser over here I don't know how much of it I can stand. Other from that its alright (Kinda). The bad thing right now is that with my attitude of getting to deep in emotions is real going to F'd me in the A, because of ala the different personalities that is over here (99% of that are the girls.) Toooo many emotions, can't really say anything without getting them mad or sad. Thats what jake doesnt know yet and will end up never knowing. One girl named Sarah Tomlinson man she goes through more emotions then anyone I have every seen in my entire life. One period she is so happy and in third she seems to be on her period. By 9th she like mentally dead, she doesn't talk nor say barely anything. I get so conused but she cool though if you get to know her in a way. I'm in a way depressed and pissed off at th same time, because a girl named Brittany (she's somewhat of a friend more of an aquaintance) is being treated like shit by these guys during lunch. Actually one of those guys is in my 8th period class and he was ok, his name is Lucas. Thats the part thats pissing me off, the part that is depressing me is that she still sits with them during lunch just because thier the only people she knows. No one should be treated like how they treat her (they throw their food at her if they don't want to eat, and they call her fucked up names). I really don't to get this personal but its really hard. Damn, its hard eating lunch when  there are bastards like them, who treat someone they know like she doesn't have feelings. The worst part is that she tries to make smile when they do all of this crap. I'm about three tables away and its affecting me this much. WHY?
WHY DO I CARE SO MUCH?
WHY CAN'T I FOCUS ON MY OWN PROBLEMS?
WHY AM I STILL THINKING ABOUT IT EVEN WHEN SCHOOL IS OVER?
WHY?
