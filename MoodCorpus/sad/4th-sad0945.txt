Too Late?
I'd like to have made my ever so subtle and thought-out move today... but for the third day in a row, she simply was not there.  This worries me, because being out for 3 days in a row can only mean something bad.  She could have transferred to another store, or gotton a better job, or is sick, or dead-- any number of possibilities, but all of them are bad.  

I have been in a very bad mood today as a result.  To have the one thing I like about work gone for so long, possibly for good, and to be surrounded by every sneering, low-life flathead within a hundred miles awaiting my service tends to do that.  

My mom is always telling me that it is entierly my fault I'm miserable.  There is nothing more frustrating... how could I be at fault when I simply have no options?  I've never had a choice.  Not only that, but I feel like I'm running out of time for any chances I may have had at all.  How long will it be before my life is completely consumed by work, and dept, and ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ELSE?  It has been my worst nightmare since I was about 12 years old.  I see my self living alone in an apartment somewhere, standing in silence, waiting for the next day of work.  Every day is the same, and I have no viable options-- I am bound, a slave to society and nothing more.  Now that nightmare is becoming a reality.  

Sometimes I wonder how nightmares so easily come true, yet dreams are impossible.
