what a day
I worked today, and it wasn't so bad, but I wasn't feeling it today.  I just felt depressed or tired all day, or something  My eyes were burning a little, but I did 16 haircuts, was out on time, and made 50 bucks.   I found out my cell was cut off, I tried to get Angel to call and pay the bill, but of course he was "too busy" on the computer to do it.  Then we go to Melly's surprise birthday party.  I kind of didn't want to go cuz I knew there would be food, and I was doing take off, which if anyone knew LA Weightloss knows that is the worst shit ever, but that is for another paragraph.  I felt ugly.  I didn't like what I was wearing, so that depressed me.  I was trying to pick a fight with Angel, cuz I was mad at him.  I just didn't feel like myself, and the we get to the party, and I didn't stick with the diet again, and I ate food.  I felt better, and didn't seem depressed anymore.  Can food do that to a person?  I mean I was so depressed I was crying, and was it from lack of food, caffeine, or the full moon?  I had a customer today tell me I should try counseling again today.  He is kind of going through the same thing with his wife that I am with Angel.  He says I should make an appointment, and tell him if he wants to go then go, but if not I am doing it for me.  He says I am looking for something that doesn't exist, and the counselor will help me to get into reality.:)
I guess we'll see.  Now take off is just juice, protein bars, 2 green veggies, and 6 oz protein.  You have that all day for 2 days.  It's bad shit, but if you do it right, you can loose 2-5 pounds in those 2 days.  Ok I think I am done.  I am going to go to bed.  Melly if you read this I love you, and hope you had a good night tonight.  Bye for now.  Na night.
