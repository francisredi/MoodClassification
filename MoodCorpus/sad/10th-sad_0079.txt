Good reads 
Have been feeling stressed and depressed lately. What a bad combination! The depression is in part the result of stress, i guess. And i went back to my books. Reading. i used to read novels regularly years ago, and i even read novels while waiting for clients during sales calls. Its a good form of stress therapy. It brings you to a totally different world, if its a good read that is. An escapism and i'd forget whatever stress i had during that moment. i bought a couple of books previously but didn't have the time to read them and i went back to those books. So far, it has calmed me down and keep my sanity in place.  

i am being pushed to the corner nowadays at work. Its overwhelming and the politics just made the environment worse. It made me lose direction as to what i have to do and made the place not enjoyable to work in. i don't quite feel happy too. Too many things are happening. 

i guess that's the corporate world, whether i like it or not, and i have to constantly remind myself about dealing with it and facing it. Its probably the same everywhere and i just have to make the best use of the time i am there. 

At least i have my novels to turn to when i am down, to escape into a different world for awhile. And that is pleasure.
