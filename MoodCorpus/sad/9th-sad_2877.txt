*sigh*
I hate it when you try to talk to someone, and it's like talking to a brick wall. They know how upset it's making you, but they don't seem to know how to fix it. 

I know it's not his fault, but Chris keeps pulling the whole, "I don't have anything to talk about" thing. I know that he's got WAY more happening to him than I do, but he still doesn't want to talk to me about it.

He claims to be cleaning all the time. I'll believe him, but it's not like we can't talk about the future or something. I've been dying to ask him a question about something, but there's always people around him, so I don't ask. I was going to tonight, but he got interrupted again. *sigh*

I feel like my insides are in a blender. I can't sleep, I'm gaining weight, I'm depressed all the time. I need some closure. Badly. If this doesn't end, I don't know what I'll do. I'm ready to break. I'm almost giving up again, and sometimes I think that the only thing holding this relationship together is the fact that I'm too stubborn to give up. Sometimes I think it's hopeless, but then he says something completely out-of-the-blue like, "I miss you" or something like that, and I kick myself for even thinking about ending things. I feel like such an ass.
It's tearing me up.  :'(

Sometimes, I miss him so much that I almost can't breathe. Other times I want to reach through the phone and strangle him. I just don't know what to do. I'd feel like shit if I broke up with him, but I don't know what else to do to make the pain go away.
I know that breaking up would make the pain worse, but at least it would be something solid that I could count on for being real.

My heart can't take much more.
