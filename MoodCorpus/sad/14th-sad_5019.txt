emo post feel free to ignore
i really need to sort this depression out, its gone from feeling anxious to just not enjoying anything i normally would which is a clear sign its depression bot anxiety. have tried not to drink so much, i had 2 pints on friday 2 last night an a few cans today, nothing compared to normal but it doesnt seem to have helped yet. im at that stage where if i didnt talk to anyone all week or leave my flat doubt many ppl would notice it would only get noticed cos im not online. see? how stupid i clearly have great friends who would totally give a shit but to me i just cant see it. kay was arguing with me the other night abou this saying loads of ppl would miss me too much if i left but they wouldnt they`d miss me a bit but it would go away, im not a significant person in anyones life im totally removable. that kind hits the nail on the head im removable. an i also no that i moan too much on here an ppl get bored of it an just think oh another emo jodie post so genuine sorry to u guys. just want something to feel happy about, and someone who cares for me an how i spend my day etc
