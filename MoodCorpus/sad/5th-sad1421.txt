shed your skin and be who you are, unencumbered by the weight of every little scar
..Don't I wish. Somewhere between late December and now, I've fallen back into depression. I just want the world to stop long enough for me to get off and ideally, find some nice hole to curl up in til its over. There are some reasons for this, which I don't have the energy or time to post on tonight. I like to think its just real life, not more medication needed (though its still helping tons), but who knows? Its not like my brain chemistry has approached normal in years. There isn't really a point to this except I see myself withdrawing and recognizing the signs. I feel selfish even posting this, because I'm still so much less anxious and miserable than many other times. It hardly feels like I have the right to complain now. It stings though and cuts through any illusions I started to harbor that it was really over and things would be 'okay' as opposed to better. I think thats why the real life bits bother me. Because my brain and all those voices in my head want to talk it as confirmation of how stupid I am and was to think something better was within reach.

I'll be okay though. I've been much worse, my friends have been just kickass and I'm functioning much better than before. I'd just like it to stop.
