two gilmore girls episodes and both telling me things unusually close to what i might need to hear right now.  or something.  first of all, not to sit at home waiting for a boy to call.  and second, that life isn't about closure.  those were max's words.  not that my life decisions are in any way dictated by a show with fictitous characters.  but it's kind of odd that right now--RIGHT NOW--i'm getting these messages.  . . . this is ridiculous.  

so why am i sitting at home waiting for a boy to call/text?  and why do i disagree about the closure thing?

. . . i sent him a text.  it's less than calling, yet still doing something.  and of course i haven't heard back.  i'm an idiot.  why did i think he might respond?  what the heck did i do to deserve this treatment?  i'm being punished b/c i have morals.  apparently.  but i don't know for sure since he won't get in touch with me to tell me if i'm wrong.  and why the crap am i still thinking about him and this?  sheeeesh.  i just want to get him out of my head and i thought talking to him, finding out his side of things and finally being able to explain mine, would help me to put him behind me.  but he's still ignoring me.  unless he hasn't received the text, which is a possibility.  but now i just feel more stupid.  and like i want to call even more.  

arrrgghh.  i hate boys.  i hate relationships.
