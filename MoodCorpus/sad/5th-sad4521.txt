Why must people always out me down? and make me feel so awful about myself. I dont think im that bad of a person. i know ive been difficult to get along with recently but ive been so sick and everything and i myself havent been happy. they make me feel so worthless and like im such an awful person who doesnt even deserve to be living. i feel so weak and like i dont know what to do. im trapped. no i dont want to run and cry to justin. but he seems to be the only person who cares about me and respects my feelings. im so sick of crying over being hurt. i hate the insults and the hurt and the pain and the negativity that they always put upon. im never good enough. and it seems like i never will be. im sorry i cry but im vulnerable and i hurt inside. no one even cares. i feel like im so alone and no one even wants to be my friend or even around me. im never going to be amy or be perfect. im never going to be her; the daughter she always loved and always want. im sick of everyone waking away from me and giving up. as if im a special case. like im useless and theres never going to be anything to make me better. im sorry i am the way i am. maybe i should just go and no one would ever have to deal with me. ever again. 
i dont want to be here.
