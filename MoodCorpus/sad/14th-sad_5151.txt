Losing it
I can't focus.  I don't know how I'm gonna make it through my exams.  I'm missing papers that I need to study from.  I don't understand some of the questions on my 231 lab final.  I haven't even dared to look at the course final.  Tuesday I'm gonna die.  I don't think enough chocolate exists in this world to get me through it.  The hardest part is I don't even know why I'm putting myself through this.  I don't know where I'm going, I don't know what I'm doing, I have nothing to work towards, and so no real reason to push myself forward on this.  I mean the questions look simple enough, but Dessa doesn't word things very nicely when she asks them.  "What are the general types of control signals needed to control the PDP8 architecture?"  What the fuck is that supposed to mean.  It looks straight forward, but what does she mean by control signals.  In the lab she talked about signals being wires, and what do the wires do.  I think she's talking about busses, but I really have no fucking clue how to tie it all together.  Gods, I really do feel stupid.  I'm not smart enough for this course.  I'm just not on par with everyone else. I don't feel like I know anywhere near as much as the guys in my classes do.  I'm a geek, yes, but a bloody sad one.  I've always felt that my intelligence was my one saving grace, but now I feel I don't even have that.  I feel like there is nothing good about me, and thus right now am worthless.  I hate being depressed, it really sucks.
