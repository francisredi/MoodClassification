If it makes you less sad I will die by your hand I hope you find out what you want I already know what I am And if it makes you less sad We'll start talking again And you can tell me how vile I already know that I am I'll grow old Start acting my age I'll be a brand new day In a life that you hate A crown of gold A heart that's harder than stone And it hurts a whole lot But it's missed when it's gone Call me a safe bet But I'm betting I'm not I'm glad that you can forgive I'm only hoping as time goes That you can forget If it makes you less sad I'll move out of the state You can keep to yourself I'll keep out of your way And if it makes you less sad I'll take your pictures all down Every picture you paint I will paint myself out It's cold as a tomb And it's dark in your room When I sneak to your bed To pour salt in your wounds So call it quits Or get a grip You say you wanted a solution You just wanted to be missed You are calm and reposed It lets your beauty unfold Pale white like the skin stretched over your bones Spring keeps you ever close You are second hand smoke You are so fragile and thin Standing trial for your sins Holding onto yourself the best you can You are the smell before rain You are the blood in my veins
