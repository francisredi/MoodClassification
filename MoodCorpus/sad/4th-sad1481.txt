A needed goodbye
The time is up.  I am tired of the waiting game.  I need to know right now.  Do you want me, or am I the endless pawn in your nasty game?  You've had opportunity after opportunity, and now I am done with you.  I am moving on.  I am now going to be your mystery.  You can contemplate my next move.  The sand has blown away.  I am tired of the little guessing game.  I am moving on.  I am sick and tired of feeling less than you.  I am sick and tired of you not paying any attention to my needs.  I am just sick and tired of you.  
I know you are the best at everything that you do.  I know that you will succeed.  I know your brain will click on something one of these days.  I just don't think we were bound to ever be on the same pathways.  And I am tired of floating through space without the parachute I started out with.  I don't need this anymore.  One day I know I will find happiness.  But I also know that happiness is most likely not with you.  I will never be good enough to sit beside you.  I know that we will never be one.  And I know that I am tired of being your pawn that doesn't know how to move.  
I will pack my clothes and find a new residence.  Maybe one day I will have a home.  Maybe one day someone will see the greatness that makes me.  You are brillant while I am the teacher that never learns when to let someone go.  Now I need to know.  Do you want me?  Do you need me?  I need to know right now.  A kiss and a hug and I will walk out that door, and finally I will wake up to my lonely life.
