denise
well, the memorial service was today. I'm not fully sure it hit me yet. Denise is really gone. I won't see her when I come back from break. It still just feels as if I am on break and will see her when I get back. I didn't think the memorial service would be as hard as it was. I don't cry! Why did I have such a hard time with it? Pastor marty was comparing her to mary which I feel was a very good comparison. I only knew her for a little over two years. Everything was going so well for her. Bryan had just finished his bachelors in june and she just finished her masters in june as well! She was only 35! She had so much potential and everything was cut short. I don't understand it. I don't do well at funerals. I know I don't, never have and probably never will. I felt so bad for Bryan. Normally so jolly and fun today he was just miserable. Who could blame him? He lost his wife! My heart goes out to him. They had pictures from denise's life. She was so beautiful! Again I just don't understand why she had to die! With the pictures they had both her guide dogs harnesses both prosper and hettie. I swear dogs can tell when there is something wrong or sad. There were a lot of guide dogs there because denise, being blind, had a lot of blind friends. All the dogs were so solemn, so reverent. Hettie and prosper were there too and looked just as lost as brian. Denise was a wonderful woman and she will be greatly missed.
