Feeling effin sorry for myself...
So much for a happy and fun day today. It had to rain, making everyone in this house tired, grouchy and just plain depressed. As if our life in general isn't depressing enough, let's just add water and watch it grow.

I am so sad! It's ridiculous. My heart is so full of guilt and hurt and bitterness it's unreal. My poor baby, Aidan, just can't even look at his mommy without her getting upset and yelling at him for something that is no reason to get upset about! I keep asking myself WHAT the hell is wrong with me, my son is doing nothing wrong, so what he spilled water and made a mess, so what if he likes to drag all his toys out. He's a little boy, thats what they do, so why the hell is it that anything he does irritates me? It's not fair to him! I'm tempted to go a counselor or SOMETHING and get some help. I can't stand this depression and anger anymore!  It breaks my heart for my son not want anything to do with me and for him to look up at me with tear filled eyes because mommy is to mad and irritated to play with him or to hold him and cuddle him, and daddy is to damn busy on his F****** computer to do anything else. It's killing me. I can't stand to see my son so lonely. I plan on getting together with a friend of mine whose little boy is the same age as Aidan so they can play more often, Aidan is always in this house, alone with noone to talk too or nothing to do. He's a lonely little boy and I can't let him grow up like that. Didn't I say that I wanted my son to grow up happy, emotionally healthy and socialized...? What happened?! 

Oh just let me wallow in self pity for a little while, I'll grow up tomorrow...

G'night for now, I'm going to go hug my baby boy and try to tell him how sorry I am...
