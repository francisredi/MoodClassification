Sometimes I Just Need To Write
Now, before any of you ask, I'm going to answer a few questions. I don't know why I'm acting like a complete bitch today, I just am. I don't know why my life seems to be falling apart, it just is. I don't know why I can't seem to get my "perfect" relationship to be perfect. I know that there's an awful lot of fighting going on in this "perfect" relationship. And I know that I can't talk to him because we start fighting. And it almost happened today.
Why does it seem like&nbsp;I'm always fucking up? I get this amazing guy and it's great for a while. And then we start fighting. And it's not about stupid stuff. Dan and I aren't fighting about stupid stuff. In all reality, our fight actually makes sense. But it's our fight and I really shouldn't tell people about what it is.
I had to actually stop talking to him because I knew that the next thing out of my mouth was going to be something that started a fight. I mean, I know that this fight needs to be resolved, but&nbsp;I know that it's not getting anywhere fast. Everytime we try to fix it, we just end up fighting again. And it's getting to the point where I'm about to just fall apart because I can't help thinking about how completely fucked our relationship is getting.
We're falling apart. And I don't know how to fix it.
Love,
