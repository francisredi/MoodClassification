you probably don't care 
I feel like shit. I feel extremely depressed. I've felt this way for too long. You probably look at me and laugh thinking, whatever, she isnt depressed.. its not like it rules her life.
Does depression run your life when you cry yourself to sleep every night? 
You only know the half of it.
I started crying in the car with my mom today because I was thinking about Ryan and how Stefany is dealing and then it made me think about how I don't see her and my mom told me that she thinks she dropped me as a friend. Id like to not think that. But as much as I'd like to think that she hasn't replaced me or doesn't like Erin better, the truth is she has and does. I hate drifting from friends, especially a friend you once considered Best. After everything ive ever done for her, all the times I was there for her, suprised her and took her out, broke into her house and cleaned her room, brought her food or ramon noodles.. after everything I'm suddenly nothing to her. I know i'm not nothing, thats being dramatic, but it sure feels like that. I do appreciate that she came to my play....and then left after 5 minutes.
There isnt anything I can do. I'm done with complaining to her, it doesnt get me anywhere and ive done it way too many times.
My mom tried to point out to me that i have many many friends and that losing one wasn't too bad. I never wanted to punch my mom more in my life. She just doesn't realize the importance of Stefany in my life. Stefany doesn't even realize it. I couldn't care if i had 150 friends.When you slip away from one it hurts just as bad as if you had only 2 friends.
I never realized how much it hurts to lose a friend. 
It hurts more that she isn't even gone and I've still lost her.
