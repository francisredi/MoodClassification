Shitty
So today started off alright, got lots of sleep and got to go pick up Ian from the airport last night. It was great to see him again. Then the day started to be pretty sad and lonely and gay...went to class after lunch for 2 hours and then went to dinner a little later. After dinner it really really really sucked and wish it never had happened, but it did, can't change the past. So now I am doing really really really shitty. Got to chill with Ian and Meaghan tonight for a little bit which made me feel a little better but nothing for the next couple of days if not longer will be able to make me happy. I have two tests tomorrow where one is going to kick my ass no matter how hard I study. Then I have the Bishop's Bowl hockey tourny Friday and Saturday and also babysitting my sister which is actually fun and then helping out with the Marriage Conference. On top of all that I have exam week coming up so it is not a great time for all of this to be happening when I had the worst night of my life! So yeah sorry I don't have a lot for you to read but there really isn't that much that happened today that is worth writing about. Got to get back to studying...oh boy what fun! Hope you all have a wonderful day and a wonderful life...
