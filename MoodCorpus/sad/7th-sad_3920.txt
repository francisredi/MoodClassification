More Gloomy Days
For the past few days, I've had this horrible pain in my stomach.  Like, the feeling of it being in knots.  I know why I'm having these pains, but they can't even compare to the pain I'm feeling in my heart.  I talked to a few friends today, and I'm confident that things will eventually start to look up, but I'm also afraid that me and him will never be back together.  Right now, that's all I want.  But who knows, this is either going to make me realize that I'm not supposed to be with him and I'll find someone new, or this is going to make us both realize we do need to be together.  I think that I would feel a lot better about this whole situation if I knew that he was sad or feeling anywhere near what I am feeling.  But I don't know that.  I just wish that things could be different at this point.  As long as I'm doing something, I'm pretty good, but once I get a moment to think--it all goes downhill from there.  The knot feeling in my stomach comes back, I feel the tears forming in my eyes, and it's like all of it re-plays over and over again in my head.  I feel like I have no one to really talk to.  Yes, it's nice to talk to my friends and they're being so awesome and trying to cheer me up.  But it's like, everyone's saying move on, you can do better, focus on school--when really I just wana say, I don't wana do that, I want my boyfriend back!  I don't know, I just want to have something to look forward to, and at this point, I don't even have that...........
