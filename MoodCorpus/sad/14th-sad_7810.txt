Why does this hurt so bad? I'm so stressed out as it is...I have to pull a dance off in two days single hand-edly, I have a major geo test tommorow which I don't feel ready for, fitness testing tommorow which will be horrible either way because I'm horrible at running or anything physical, a major pre cal test on friday which I haven't studied for at all and which I have no time to study for and I have no one I can talk to about this at all. I don't really have a best friend. I have a lot of "friends" i guess but none that I can tell anything too. I think that's what I want the most... Ughh I'm so stupid. I would be able to talk to him about this but he's away right now again and I've sent him several text messages none of which he has replied to. I'm sleep deprived, sick and depressed. I needed him to just say something, anything to make me feel better but he hasn't and I know he can. He brought his cell for a reason; to talk to me. Yet the time I need him to say something the most is the time he says nothing at all. I can't keep doing this. Why does it seem I'm the one who always gets hurt in this? We are very close and I can tell him everything yet this time, the time I need him the most he's away and chooses to say nothing. If he doesn't have a good reason to explain this one I don't know what I'll do. Why do I need him here so badly? I can't stand this. I have other underlying reasons to why I'm so upset with him but I just can't say them...I feel like I'm going to die or throw up or cry all at once. I hate this feeling. Why I am so depressed right now? The best part is I'm good at faking it. Tommorow will be fine. Tommorow's always fine. But it's today I can't stand.
