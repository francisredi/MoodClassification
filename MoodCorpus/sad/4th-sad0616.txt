i'll get you walfrish
nicki we need to get our shit together and start figuring out rent/deposit/hydro account-etc. my parents are moving into an apartment, so we're taking the barbeque, lawn mower, and porch swing which i think are thigs we need anyway, so hopefully we can find a place to put them...

on a completely different subject, you ever just randomly start crying and can't figure out why? totally happened to me last night. i didn't even feel sad or anything. it wasn't like my eyes were just watering or anything...i was really crying...then i got sad. this can't be good. have i been cramming my sad into a void for so long that it's starting to overflow and pop up randomly? sometimes it scares me how good i've gotten at blocking out bad times....so good that even when i sit, for hours sometimes, trying to remember specific things i just can't...there's nothing there. this might seem like a blessing, but trust me, it's terrifying. i've decided i need to start keeping a hand written journal so this will stop.

also, do you ever notice how when around certain people you act different? everyone does, maybe not drastically, but somewhat. i've come to realize i absolutely hate who i am around most people, and love who i am when around dylan...and get those thoughts out of your head, i'm not saying anything here, it's just that i'm so easy going around him...and jon. i've had some of the best times ever with those guys.
