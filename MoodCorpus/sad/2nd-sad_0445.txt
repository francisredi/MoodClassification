White Star Two is Dead
And with a sad sad noise, it has conked out. I managed to yank all my schoolwork, kingdom stuff, and some artwork and pictures before it gave out, and I think I have all, or at least most, of my Greece photos on CD. And I'd just uploaded the music I recorded Thursday, so that's on my website.

Living on a computer as much as I do, it's just scary having it go down on me. Too much of my life is writing, art, music, and communication, all of it saved and archived. 

The main losses are passwords, preferences, registration for various applications, and mail. The mail is a problem. Mergh. Yes, I know Aeryn will now tell me again that i need gmail, even though I vastly, vastly prefer having mail on my computer where I can copy and paste without losing all the formatting. Oddly, I tried to sign up for gmail, and it absolutely will NOT accept any username I submit.  I gave up after eight different tries; I don't really believe that sepdet and every single Elvish word I could think of were taken.

I do not deserve the good fortune I have, however-- how dare I be able to get myself out of this, when so many of my friends are so tight on money? I ordered the low-end iBook from MacMall on Thursday, got it Friday, or I would currently be offline with no computer on which to write my term papers save a 10-year-old Mac clone that isn't compatible with any modern printer (it has zip disks, so I could presumably carry my work to Kinko's in a pinch.)
