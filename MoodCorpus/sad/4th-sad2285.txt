Grandma Vera
My Grandma Vera passed away tonight. Earlier today my sister called me at work and said they gave grandma a couple days to live. So we went to the nursing home after work and saw her. I didn't expect to cry. It surprised me some when I walked in grandma's room and immediatly broke down. I tried to be strong. Grandma laid there in bed. She could not move and only stared at nothing with her eyes hardly opened. We told her who we were and that we loved her. My sister told grandma in her ear that she could go. I wonder if that helped her. 

My grandma had been in the nursing home since she was 90. She got real bad two weeks after her birthday (feb 14). She has alzheimers. She just kept getting worst. I hadn't seen her in two years because I wanted to remember her the way I knew her as a child. I use to visit her often and she would tell me stories of her life. I wish I could have still talked to her like that. But like I said, she got worst. She got to the point of not know who was who. 

A month ago I had a dream. Someone had died and everyone was sad. We were at a funeral or some kind of after funeral function. I remember going to Shirley my great aunt whom is grandma Vera's daughter. I remember throwing my arms around her and crying. When I woke up I thought about the dream and realized the person that died was grandma Vera. I told my mom and sister my dream later that day. I figured it was just a dream. I had a dream once about my great grandma Polard's funeral, weeks after her funeral.
