a promise to myself 
I guess some people were simply meant to walk alone. looks like im one of them. sometimes i think i shouldnt give up on someone i love because everything is soo hard, but then sometimes i think im simply being stupid and putting myself through hell for some guy who probably wouldnt even remember my name if he didnt see it everytime he signed into msn. well i realized how low ive sank, and to be quite honest, i didnt want to stop loving him, but somehow i became aware that all of this is soo stupid, like why hell am i doing this to myself? he doesnt love me, he never has and nor will he, and thats not his fault, its mine for not just accepting everything. its just me being too hopeful to give up, and to blind to see what my hoping will lead to. well as of now, ive struck rock bottom, and as of tomorrow, im going to stop torturing myself. i cant handle this anymore, like everyday i wake up and hope that something has changed, and go to bed hoping something will change tomorrow. but it never does. now i realize that nothing will change unless i change with it. so im changing the way i think ... im not hoping anymore. im done torturing myself, and as of tomorrow, this girl walks alone. <3 Miranda
