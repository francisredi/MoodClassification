Depressed...a little
I've decided to post something today in this livejournal. Because, well I haven't posted anything in a week. I guess it must be because I have been feeling a bit depressed lately. Everything seems to tick me off and I can't seem to find any sort of solution to the problem. Hanging out with friends, I thought that I could perhaps cheer up and everything would be ok. Wrong, one of my friends said something to me, I don't really recall what he said, but it hurt my feelings and I ended up yelling at him. Throwing some sort of text book at him and leaving the house. After the incident only left me feeling worse and worse. At school, I'm even more miserable. Kids seem to hate me :: I don't know if this is true or not, it could be my own evil mind at the works:: but they just turn there backs on me. I feel as if everything is my fault and I am motivated to do absolute nothing. This type of living isn't healthy anf I know that. If I don't try or make a commiment to stop what I am doing it might lead to some serious drug abuse, alcohol use and even violence against my family. It's crazy, but I doubt I will be lead into this thing so far.
