I'm back in Baton Rouge for tonight.  The viewing is tomorrow night, the memorial service Thursday and burial Friday.  I'm glad I get to be by myself tonight.  My father's and aunt's grief is cloying.  It's so hard.  To see his space on the couch empty...Donna (my aunt and 2nd mom) laid down to take a nap on his couch.  She was there before he went into a coma that night with my other aunt and grandma.  HE was having problems breating and apparently there were moments where he got an awful panicked look in his eye as he couldn't take a breath.  He wasn't afraid of death, but the act of dying...he eventually lost the ability to blink and appparently was just turning towards voices.  his eyes never closed, but remained wide open as he just slipped away.  It makes me sad to know these things.  I am sad that I wasn't there to help Donna and be there for her and Claire and Paul, but I am not sad that I missed that horrible look in his eyes.  The day papaw took aturn for the wose, my grandma almost died too.  She went to the bathroom and passed out.  Her heart stopped and she quit breathing.  They found her when they wnet to check on her after awhile.  For abit it looked like we would lose them both.  It was the stress and dehydration.  The family is holding together the best they can, though the family dynamics are coplex; there are many different personalities and wills, all of them strong and some tension is developing.   It will be a long week.  But I am glad that his pain is over.  That he will never have to spend another day in the hospital. That he knew I loved him and I know he loved me.  I will miss him so much.  He was my buddy.  I have to go now. I cna't see through the tears.
