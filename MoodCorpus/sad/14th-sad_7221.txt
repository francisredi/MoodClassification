Haha...
Today I saw a road sign on my way to work "Expect road work delays from 4/17 - 4/31". Haha. Someone should fire that guy. 

Anyway... been rather down lately. My mom left town after being here for 2 weeks. I always get sad when she leaves. 

I've been stressing about money because my bank is retarded. But I fixed it all up today (took me half the frickin morning) and now I can FINALLY use my f*%kin' money. 

My roomates are on my nerves once again. The apartment is trashed once again and for once I'd like to be able to come home and chill with my roomates without 20 million other people around. *sighs* So I locked myself in my room most of the night. 

I feel like nothing is left for me here anymore. I know I must move on, but the process is long and hard. I'm scared and I feel alone. And don't sit here and reply telling me "oh you're not alone" because I am. I don't see you physically standing here with me. Until then, I feel like I have no real friends to turn to. No place to run away to, and thus am forced to fight the trials of life alone. Sure I have people here I "hang out with" but when the time comes, and I need someone, I turn around - and no one is here. That is the sadest thought I have had in a long time.
