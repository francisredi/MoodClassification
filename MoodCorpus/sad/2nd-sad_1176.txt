Sad Day
I picked up the latest Artvoice, one of Buffalo's independent newspapers and saw a whole page on the back from my favorite sushi bar, Kuni's. It reads:


Great friends:

It has been almost a decade since I first opened Kuni's Sushi Bar. It has been a wonderful journey for me. Yet it is with a sad hear that I tell you that I have decided to close.

My original vision for the restaurant was to have a small, intimate place where I could hang out with my friends and enjoy the company of patrons. I never dreamed that it would be so successful, that I would not have free time to spend with customers night after night.

Thank you for a decade of wonderful memories. I have had the opportunity to meet so many new people and to make many new friends. Please know that in my heart I have always been thankful for each and every person that came into my restaurant. I just never had the time to let each and every one of you now how much I appreciate you.

I look forward to seeing all of you in the future.

Thank you,
Kuni


In other words my favorite sushi place is closing. A sad day. A sad day indeed.

I wish Kuni all the luck in the world. He's a great cook, host, and overall person.
