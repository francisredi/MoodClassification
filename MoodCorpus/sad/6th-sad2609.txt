finally it's friday...and i hate to say it but this week went kind of fast.  if this is what a fast week feels like, then im scared to know what a slow one will!  i have a lot of things to think about lately...my boyfriend says i've been acting differently, but i dont know why.  i've just been in a generally weird mood for the last few weeks.  it's easy to attribute it to school or not excersizing, but i'm not sure that's what's wrong this time.  i honestly can't figure it out though.  i think, for me, the worst part about being a girl is that i have so may hidden feelings and dimensions that i'm not particularly aware of, so when i'm feeling down i usually can't find the source as it is probably burried so deeply in my subconscious.  that may also explain why i have the weirdest dreams; not scary, per se, but just plain bizarre.  im also really pissed off because i just got a C- in my history class, and i just wrote my dad an email to tell him...let me explain about my dad: he's a major stickler for grades.  he's one of those "nice A, but an A+ would be better!" kind of people.  now, being me--a mediocre student who works harder than her peers just to reach their same level if not lower-- that's always tough to hear.  i definately have some sort of learning disorder (i was diagnosed with ADD, but still have some other issues and am a painfully slow reader) and i always find myself spending more time on certain assignments that other people yet still recieving lower grades.  but this C- that i got, well that just screwed my confidence up so much!  im not a great student, but i've never gotten a grade that low.  i'm more used to the B-, B, B+ and occasionally an A...but never a C or worse, C-.  my dad still hasnt answered the email that i sent about 5 days ago, so either he hasnt even gotten it, or he has gotten it and has now disowned me as a child haha...but seriously, i bet he's pissed.  oooh well, i guess i dug my own grave.
