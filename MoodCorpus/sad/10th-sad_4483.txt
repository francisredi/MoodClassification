there's nothing inside her, she's weak and she's tired of feeling like this.

I'm sick of feeling depressed all the time, I'm sick of waking up in the morning with an uneasy feeling in the pit of my stomach. I'm sick of hurting myself, and knowing that i'm hurting myself, but still doing it. I'm sick of being subpar in everything i attempt. Well, almost everything. I have such a sadistic sense of humor sometimes.

Of course, it's not all bad. It's never all bad. How can you be too upset when you have some awesome roommates that conjegate in your room and take over your bed? you can't.
 
How can you be overly upset when you have a great weekend to look forward to? *grin* you can't. (ps. i'm taking a lot of pics this weekend, so watch for them in a few days)

I'm the only one that can make sure i don't fall apart. I have to remember that. I have to keep waking up and going about my day. If i have to fake a smile or laugh or an orgasm or two (lol), so be it. Life goes on. Maybe some day i'll be happy, maybe someday i won't. Who the hell knows. Why do i always give pep talks to myself?
