Lonely, I'm so lonely, I have nobody, to call my own
Sometimes I get lonely, I need someone to talk to when I'm sad or relieve stress and no one is there.  I wonder sometimes if things would be different if I didn't have AJ, but if no one is here now no one would be there if I didn't have him.  He is the only thing I got I can actually rely on to be there for me, basically because he can't leave.  I dread the day when he decides to be "Mr. I want to go live with my dad", cause I know it will come.  I am glad someone will love me and be there for me and can't turn their back on me like so many others have done.  I have to give it to myself, I am a strong female.  Most women would crawl back to their ex.  Just because my life is shit right now, I have no reason to make my son's life a living breathing hell.  Women like that are selfish, the old excuse of "I was doing it for the kid's sake" is a load of shit, your doing it cause your selfish ass can't take the psychological pressure that comes with being lonely.  I know there will be a time when AJ decides he no longer needs me and moves on, I just hope that he won't have to go through what I'm going through right now.  

On a lighter note, AJ will be 7 months old tomorrow, I can't freakin believe it.  He is pulling himself up on the couch now, I think he'll be walking by February.  I love the joys that a child can bring by flashing that cute little smile and not wanting anyone else but his mommy, that is the best feeling in the world.  Off to make bottles...
