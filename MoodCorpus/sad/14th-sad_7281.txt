Depression
I just realised. I use food as a drug. 

Really. There is a certain contentment that comes with having a full stomach, the sort of contentment that others may get from family or friends or whateverthefuck they get it from
But with my family a glacier (i.e cold and distant) away, I feel I can turn to food like an old friend and have it bring up my mood again

If I could do one thing for my daughter, I WOULD NOT RAISE HER LIKE I WAS RAISED. I am so like my Aunt it's untrue, and I see why that is. Our upbringing has brought it out in us, the desire to seek ourselves and be cold and distant because it has brought us time with ourselves because we are not social creatures. But this has another side, it makes me desire a contact like an idealistic mother, a hug, a cuddle, PRAISE to let me know there is some sort of validity in what I do anymore.

Most people would turn around and with a few colourful choice words tell me to do things for myself. But you do not understand, you seriously do not fucking understand. I need the praise and backing to make me feel worthy and wanted, to make me know that what I am doing is actually important. I just want a mother that takes intersted in what I do.

The chain of mothering that brought me here has been in extremes. My grandmother is the over-interested while my mother, because she was raised with that, is the polar opposite and I just want to set myself on fire to see if she would notice. More than ever I just want a little baby that will hug me and smiel at me and let me know that I am wanted and loved

This is heavy crap for a Wednesday, I've just been in tears all day. I felt weird earlier on, now it's come to depression.

Where is a physical manifestation of a Muse when you want a hug ...
