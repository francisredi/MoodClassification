down
when i am here, alone in my chilly room i am lonely.  this is when i think i am stupid for going away.  i would give anything to call someome now, but its expensive and i've decided to limit myself to once a week for my own good.  the vacation feel is wearing off even though its only been a few days.  this is like going to college for the first time all over again, slightly worse because being farther away and a different language and culture, but slightly better because i've gone through something kinda like this before.  i've started doing normal things again--internet, music, mario--and at first i felt better, but now it's worse.  now i want to be at home and not here with people i barely know.  this is exactly like going to college the first time.  the internet is lonely.  you all are at work or doing home things and are not online.  you still have a couple weeks off of school.  i am terrified of my roommates coming.  i like being alone here, no alarms in the a.m.  yes i am lonely sometimes but it saves the pressure of talking and stuff.  i think in spanish as i fall asleep.  tomorrow will okay, a tour of puebla.  later tonight might even be better, i am meeting a girl i get along with well to go to a bar.  i have a feeling its going to fall through.  i just want to crawl into my warm comfy soft bed at school or home.  i want to be at barnes and noble or eating hunans.  i want david to tell me he has to go home and then peel me off and put on his shoes.
