:( and it happens again.
And the eternal fight for power continues.

This weeks episode sees the ever more hobby like Michael taking on the ever more saddening father Dad.

So anyways, micheal gets home today and like within 10 mins of him being in the door arguments start. then like 10 mins ago dad and michael had a massive fight because michael dont think its fair he has to pay $500 for dads old queen water bed. its in like near perfect condition. wat he is really pissed about is the fact that dad owes him $1000 that he made a bet with him for ages ago and dad didnt pay up. but it was a stupid bet that michael should have known was not serious. and so anyways this argument goes on for ages and dad eventually goes fine wat u want the $1000 here u go and dad hands michael $1000 with which michael then goes and chucks it on the table. and the argument continues again, at first he wanted the $1000 then he dont. then he does but doesnt wonna take it from dad coz he is angry.

all the while im am sittin here gettin sadder and sadder and increasingly depressed and stressed. as much as i say i hate my brother at sum times. i hate to see my brother and dad fightin. because even tho ive done nothin wrong i still feel to blame.
i should have set a better example and all that big brother shit.
all i know now is michael will go out in a couple days stay out for like any where from 2-6 days get stoned and drunk and probly do other drugs also and next time we here from him will be wen he wants dad to either put money in his bank or pick him up. and if that dont happen it will be wen he comes how to have a show, change clothes and have sumin to eat.

neways im gonna go be sad and depressed by myself. u all have a good night.
bye
