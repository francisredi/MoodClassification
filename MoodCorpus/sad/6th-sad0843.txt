Hell:day 5
Since Saturday ive had a fever of 102, varying points somtimes 103. They know what i dont have they dont know what i do have. They know the other name for why i can barely breathe sometimes is called the devils handshake or the devils grip. The only person i can talk to while everyone else is at school where i should be taking exams is too busy with his game and wont talk to me. like we're on the phone but he wont talk to me. I need to talk to somebody about something anything. Jake cheered me up soo much last night by just talking to me it was soo good to hear from him. My fever finally broke today but i still have to stay home, my arms are bruised from blood drawings, my throat feels like its on fire, i finally got to eat jello today and a little cup of soup last night and ive lost far too much weight. i stand i can see my ribs. Im soo scared. i just want to go to bed and not wake up. If my fever goes up again itll send me into full body shakes and i want to get the hell out of my house. i try to take a shower and i almost pass out. I fell down my steps last night my ankle and back still hurt. On the plus side i am hydrated enough to sit in my bed for days on end and cry and maybe go downstairs with my moms help. The fever breaking is a good sign yes hopefully i can go to school tomarrow. He let me go a little bit ago to get some food and should be calling me back so i can listen to him talk to others ina  chat room but not me. Its sad that i look foreward to that. I need to go back to bed i feel like im going to pass out. bye.

Best of luck with all of your exams, thank you Jake for making me fell better about mine. Youre probably right. Thank you so much it helped a lot.
