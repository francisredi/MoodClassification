I Hate Days Like This
I was gonna take a hit at someone in my LJ but she is just not worth my time.  IMO I think she needs a psych ward.

On to other things...


Today was so uncool because my co-worker called the main office to say her husband was sick so she could not come to work.  HUH?  I am sorry but if my husband was sick wih phnemonia I would go to work.  Hell all he is gonna do is lay in bed all day.  I mean what do you want me to do, hold his hand for Christ sake?  Someone has to make the money.  Come to find out he went to work today and was gonna be there till 11.  Now she has told my company that she is taking him to the doc so she cant work.  All she had to do was say "I need to get off by a certain time so I can take him to see a doctor when he gets off from work"  but no.  Now she called me to say "sorry about you having to work today"  umm yeah "I will work monday for you"  There I sit with a sore throat on my day off and the more I think about it the more pissed I become.  I call her back.  "Dont come in Monday come in the next two Saturdays in a row, you were off last weekend and this one that will help me more than you working Monday"  click.  I am not about to give up a full monday so she can get like an extra day of pay.  LOL righhhhht think again.  The reason she did not want to work was written on her calendar at work "Pam's baby shower 2:00"  I would not have known it was there had I not been looking for a file I needed that a customer said she had.  Well I hope she enjoys the next two Saturdays with our idiot customers because I am so not going to be anywhere to be gotten to work for her this time.  Game on!  I am about to lose my cool with that place.  I need a break.  I need to go see Tina and party.  I would love that so very much.  I need a person to listen to me and understand me and oh what is the use?
