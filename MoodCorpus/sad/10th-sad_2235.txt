Life's suffocation
My Differential Equations teacher returned today after being out all last week due to the death of his son.  It was almost more than one could bear.  He opened class with, "I'm going to warn you guys up front like I did my other class.  I'm pretty much brain dead today, so you guys are gonna have to watch me and if I start babbling on and on about nothing, say 'Hey, you're babbling like an idiot.'"  His voice was shakey.  Though I didn't know he was old enough to have a son as old as the one that died, he definately sounded like he aged about 20 years today.  I wonder if that was a comfort to get away from the talk of death at home and come back to the college and teach, getting back into the routine, or if it was all he could do to sit here today.  I noticed as I walked passed his office on the way to class, he had the door almost completely shut.  Quite a contrast from the normal site:  him leaned back with his feet on the desk with the door wide open, or him helping someone with a problem right before class.  I can't imagine what it must be to lose a child, or what it must be for the kids to lose their dad.  I don't know about my teacher, but it was all I could do to sit through class with the trauma and sorrow suffocating the room and its inhabitants.
