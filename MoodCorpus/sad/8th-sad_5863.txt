today is probably the saddest day so far for meee


every year nick would come over for the superbowl and even tho i hate the superbowl i still always enjoyed it because i loved being with nick he always made me laugh and hed always mock everybody there out and id actually enjoy myself amidst the stupid guys cheering for their damn team like fucking maniacs its a fucking game who gives a fuck theres more important things than football i never got football or the big deal about it whos gives a shit theyre just guys with pads on hitting each other its boring why the hell do they get paid all that money to play football?!?! its an excuse for ugly guys to be famous

andd id always say that to nick and hed always just laugh and say i was absolutely right but that its just in a guys nature to like football unless theyre gay

and i guess thats true


i miss him more than anything :(:(:( i dont know what to do without him everythings so different without him i used to talk to him almost everynight and while he was in the hospital even tho i was sad i at least was able to live with the hope that everything would be alright so it wasnt as bad for me even tho at that time i didnt talk to him like how i did before he was in the hospital and i just thought everything would eventually go back to normal so i kept myself busy but now i cant have that hope anymore ive been so depressed i dont like leaving the house it takes a lot for me to actually even wanna wake up and shower i sit on my ass all day and ive got myself so fghlkghslede over everything that it makes my tummy worse and i think thats where my tummy problem all began and theres not that many people i can talk to because either they were affected by this too and so dont know know how to make themselveshappy let alone me happy or theyve never had anybody close to them die and so they dont know what its like

and im not even willing to try and make myself happy i just let myself mope around and feel like shit and i dont want to have to depend on other people to make me happy i need to be able to make myself happy because those people cant be there 24/7 and neither do i want them to be... i want to be able to be happy on my own not solely based on other peoples ability to make me happy because else ill get nowhere...i DO need those people but i need their help in addition to MY own help


and right now, not only on this day but all days, thats not happening and ive just let depression take over


i guess eventually ill be willing to help myself but all i really wanna do is cryy and cry and cryy which is what i have been doing and it helps cause its relieving but then once i think im finally done i start crying again and thats been about 90% of my day today


i dont knoww the end i guess byebyeee
