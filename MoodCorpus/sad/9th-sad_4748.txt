blah
You know, sometimes I feel like just jumping off of a bridge. I don't know if I can face tomorrow. I don't know whats wrong with me. I feel so low lately, so lonely.
I see all my friends are happy, having kids, and getting married, and then there's me. Not that I want to get married, or have kids just yet. But the happiness, that would be nice. To be happy with someone. Have someone tell me I'm beautiful. You get it. I guess once again. I'm going to be alone on Valentines day. You know, I've NEVER had a valentine. Never. It's upsetting. 
Now take Cherry, or Ali, or anyone I know that is getting hitched. Don't get me wrong. I am so happy for them, so excited for them. But still I get these little twinges of jealousy, that both of them can be so happy in a relationship, yet, me, never. It's like happiness has been banished from my life. I just wish and pray that I could be happy in a relationship, not put up with half the fucking shit that I have put up in previous relationships. I had a dream the other night, that one of my exes, no names, proposed to me, and I just broke down, knowing that I couldn't ever say yes, because he destroyed my entire trust in him. It was wierd, I don't know. I just feel so alone right now. I hate it.
