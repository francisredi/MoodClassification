have you ever tried to go home again and it didnt work. Have you ever missed someone more than you ever imagined possible? Have you ever loved someone more than you ever thought you had, and its killing you to be away from them. That is just a taste of what I am feeling at this moment. I remember in high school when I was depressed I would write poems adn songs and spend a week in my room eating junk food and watching cartoons adn chick flicks. But I dont want to do that this time. I am having a hard time without the AIMers, and a few specific ones in particular. ( you should know who you are)

there is no way to tell you how much you mean to me, every one of you. My heart has been ripped out and devided all over the world. If it hurts this bad for three weeks imagine how its going to be once we all get on the field. I know that I am going to be going through major depression. This being away from you is killing me. We should tell Kris that three weeks is way to long to be away. 

ok so that was my depressed I want to play my guitar in a dark room and cry rant

hope you enjoyed it 

I love you all more than you know
