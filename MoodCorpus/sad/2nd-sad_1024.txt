BORED!
I was so bored last night!  I couldn't sleep and I couldn't concentrate on reading, so I just sat here in front of the television.  I was bored as hell.  I even watched the Survivor finale.  I didn't even watch the show!  Chris went to sleep at like, 10:30 or something, so I couldn't call him and bother him like I usually do when I'm all alone, and there wasn't anyone else around to bother either.  

Which is weird...in a small house with six people living in it there is usually someone around (and usually making me angry by doing whatever it is I wanted to do) no matter what time it is, but last night everyone was asleep super early.  Usually I have to fight for the television (the one in the living room, not the one in my room obviously), fight for the washing machine, fight for time in the shower, fight for time in the kitchen, but last night I could have watched TV in the shower while doing my laundry and baking a cake all at the same time. 

I guess I'd be a shitty candidate for living alone if I get bored after just one night of it.  I don't plan on ever living alone anyway.  I just figured I'd go from living with my parents to living with my husband.  I know, I know, it's kind of old fashioned and lame of me, but it's just what I always thought would happen.  I'm not anti-feminist or anything, that's just what I see for myself.  

Now I just need to find the husband!  lol ;)

Anyway, I'm going to go meet some girls from my French class at the library.  We have our French final tomorrow morning so we're going to study today.  Fun.

Somebody send me a text message.  I'm loooooooooooonely :(
