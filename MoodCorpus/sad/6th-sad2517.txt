Comments: 
         Ever had one of those days where you can't seem to cast your demons out? Where you halo falls down and tugs your neck? People you care about, people you loved, come and go, die and move on. You seem to be the only one left in a limbo of captivity. Your reflextion your only companion because you can't make amends to the dead. You fight your way free of your binds and restraints only to find that you have no where to go but back to the place where you were treated like you were nothing but a worthless item. And you finally realize... you're nothing but a pet to those pulling your strings.

Drew this while depressed, colored while I was freezing and depressed, now I'm drowning in research on the supernatural for an upcoming Saga+Kanon fic.  (the first chapter is almost done if you're interested)
