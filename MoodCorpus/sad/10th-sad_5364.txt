Stupid heart... stupid mind...
It's weird when you're walking down the hill from Sage to Carnegie, and you feel like going with the decline and falling flat on your face and sinking into the ground... and like you can't hold yourself up any more. Maybe I've put on the fight too long, and maybe he really doesn't care that I want to care about him. And stupid friends who don't understand, and therefore berate me for trying to stick up for someone when nobody else will, yet the person I'm trying to stick up for doesn't seem to want me around sometimes anyways.

I think I'm falling again, and I don't have anything to grab on to this time. Sometimes I feel like I should go drink myself into oblivion, as it feels like it's the last thing to turn to... and then see what happens between us when I'm like that, and then the next day can say "oh it was because I was drunk". Which is horrible, because that's how you become an alcoholic.

I need a new life. I need better treatment from my parents. I need to do something drastic before I go back into that horrible state I was in not too many years ago...
