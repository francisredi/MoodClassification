Personal Plans
Thanks to House, all personal plans are on hold until I manage to finish the last two episodes on the disc.  I'm going absolutely bonkers wondering what happens.  I could have found out if it weren't for my stupid back daring to hurt me for not getting enough exercise.  I could just scream.  School-don't give a fuck.  Friends-I care, but not enough to move beyond House currently.  My own personal health?  Like I said-don't give a fuck.  It's too bad one can't take a multivitamin and solve all of one's problems.  My problems are sooooooooooo easily solved.  Soooooooo then, what's the catch?  Well, I have to be the one to solve the little bloody buggers.  Sooooooo.  Stop saying 'soooooo' damnit!  Okay.  Talking to myself, yay.  That's always a good sign.  *sigh*  I'm sad, or at least I think I would be if I were willing to admit to myself I'm sad, but if I admit to myself the reason I'm sad then I'll have to admit to the reason WHY I'm sad, and I consider my reason pretty damn petty which in turn makes ME pretty damn petty and I absolutely positively REFUSE to be petty, so therefore I will not admit that I'm sad.  Does that make any sense?  NO.  Does it matter to any of you?  NO.  Good.  Glad we can move on.  Here's a cute little saying from Chase:  "I've never seen an American kid eating an apple, or riding a bike!"
