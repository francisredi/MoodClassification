Selfish?
so yesterday....
my uncle who had been sick for a while finally passed away.  i guess thats a good thing bc he had no quality of life in the end. he was sick and sadated for the past couple of weeks. i guess im glad the suffering is over. its still hard though, i was just starting to like him.  he's my nanny's brother and he really wasnt in my life until about the past year, and i was just starting to like him. anyway, the waking is tomarrow and the funeral on friday. i told kayla on the bus today and she started talking about her friend who had just gotten in a car accident and was in the hospital.  i know this sounds bad but i was really mad at her.  all i wanted to say was "AT LEAST SHE'S STILL ALIVE! DID U EVEN LISTEN TO WHAT I JUST SAID?! MY UNCLE DIED!" its just like no matter what i have to say lately, kayla has something to say to overshadow it.  is that selfish? am i wrong for being mad? this week's just been so exhosted and that really didn't help. i felt awful yesterday and all i wanted was someone to talk to and then kayla goes off on her problems....is this one of those times where im selfish beyone belief and just not realizing it?
