A reflection...
An Australian citizen, Van Nguyen, was hanged in a Singapore jail today. Yes, he was a convicted drug trafficker and, yes, I think he should definitely have been punished for his crime, but with a jail sentence, not by the sanctioned killing that we know as "capital punishment". His death won't stop people smuggling drugs into, and out of, countries, and it won't stop people using drugs for whatever reason/s they do, so what purpose has it achieved? How did it benefit anyone?
Certainly it did not benefit his family who are now left shattered and grieving beyond what most can ever imagine.

I don't live in an ivory tower with no understanding of the pain and misery that drugs can bring to individuals and families; in another life I was married to a drug addict and alcoholic, and there were times when I dreamed of hiring someone to kill him so we could all be free (but I didn't - he's still alive and walking around, happy and healthy, as far as I know!). 
But capital punishment is not the answer to the drugs problem and I feel sad for most of those who think it is. The unhealed wounds and unresolved grief that an individual must be carrying, that makes them believe that taking someone's life will somehow assuage these pains or make anything 'right', must be great indeed. There were no winners in Singapore today...
