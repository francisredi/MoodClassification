well, i've decided that a lot of the emotional crap i've been going through is self-inflicted and self-induced.  i really wish i could stop doing it.  but i can't stop thinking about a certain situation.  it's a daily occurrence.  i'm sick of it, i'm sick of dealing with it.  it's hard to find joy in anything.  i'll just lay in bed, not wanting to get up, but i force myself to get up and do something.  i don't know what i'd do if i didn't have school, work, and my gracious friends to keep me occupied.  i'd dwell on it even more than i am right now, i'd probably be depressed and...yeah..i don't know what i'd do.  probably nothing.

not to mention that my grandmother is close to passing away.  one of my best friends is having problems figuring out what's wrong with her head and why she's having headaches...i just want to save everyone from their pain.  i want everyone to be out of their misery.  i need to be pro-active and do something to remedy my situation, but i just keep digging my own "grave"...deeper and deeper.

i feel helpless.

things have got to get better, otherwise, i'm going to have a serious breakdown.
