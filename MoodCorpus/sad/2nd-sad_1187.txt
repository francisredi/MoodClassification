I'm Heartbroken
Ok so today is like totally horrible.  I heard that i had to lose weight if i ever wanted to make it on to pompom and i really really do so i like started exercising all the time and now because i've thrown up 5 times in 14 hours my b/f is starting to think i'm bulimic and that is totally not true.  I woudlnt' do that to myself plus i have before and it drained me to much.  So because i have thrown up so much he thinks i'm doing it to myself because i want him to love me more and i'm really not i'm just like sick to my stomach whenever i eat.  I dont really know why though.  So yah i cried all the way back from votech and all because he didn't want to talk to me.  And so he said we needed to talk when i got home and i think he wants to break up with me and i really dont want that i love the kid to death and i'll be heartbroken if he does that to me.  I wont be able to take it emotionally and i know that if that happens it will cause me to because really depressed and not come out of depression for a while i dont know what is up.  So yah i'm like going out of my mind and i'm trying to talk to my ex and have him calm me down and all cause that is what i want but i can't because i'm worried he still has feelings for me.  I have a friend that is having problems with her ex and mine and the ex is a complete idiot.  But he is cool in some ways i guess.  So yah i'm like having an emotional breakdown right now because i dont want any of this to happen i want it all to go away right this minute and at this point right now i really wish i had a fairy godmother to help me out of this.  So if you got any advice for me feel free to help me because i can't do it all by mself.  Thanks bye!

Forever
