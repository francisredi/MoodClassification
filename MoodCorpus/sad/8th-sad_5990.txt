So, so sad.
I am so incredibly tired of being so sad all the time.  It seems like the only time I am happy is when I am with Ian or my B.C. friends.  This stupid snow ruined my plans tonight, and I'm stuck here at home, thinking about this upcoming week back at school, and being depressed.  I didn't even get to go to church.  And I don't know if I'll be able to make it back to school tomorrow.  I might have to ride with my mom, which means I will have no car, which means I won't be able to go to church Wednesday, which means I will be very sad.  My Wednesdays are so happy, b/c I go to class, then the gym, then study at the library, and then go to my AMAZING new church and praise my AMAZING Jesus!  I missed that today.  And I miss my Ian.  I feel so pathetic!  Why can't I be happy?  Why?  At times, I get this random sense of euphoria, usually after church, but sometimes for no reason.  But the rest of the time, I'm low and looking forward to Friday.  But now it's Sunday night, I'm NOT where I want to be, and I have to deal with the crappy roads tomorrow at 8 in the morning.  Then spend virtually my whole day tomorrow studying for this psychology test Tuesday, which I have no idea if I am going to even pull off a B on.

But my life isn't that bad.  Sure, I have no money, but I don't need that.  I want friends at school though.  I need close friends to go out with and do stuff.  Ones I can confide in and ones to make me happy.  I'm so alone all week.  Sometimes I feel like Ian is my only friend.  I know it's not true, my high school friends I still love and talk to sometimes, but I never see them.  Life is so different than it used to be, and I don't like it.  I wish I could go back in time about 8 months, or fast forward 4 years.  I think what I need to do now is go and pray.  Maybe cry a little.  I'll be okay.
