Death by Chocolate...
Well, I finished a bit ago, making a death by chocolate cake for a collegue at work that is leaving us for a better company.  He was tired of not having balance between work and his family so he went somewhere that gave it to him...and paid him more money to do it.  I'm still looking for that opportunity!  But alas, he will be missed.  He is the nicest, most positive guy I know.

Last night at work was interesting.  I ended up working until 8PM helping a coworker because of some issues that came up while she was transitioning between jobs when my big boss goes on a tirade and calls my coworker and my manager into her office and tears them new assholes.  It was totally uncalled for and it caused my coworker to cry.  Nothing pisses me off more (even though it had nothing to do with me) than to see my big boss cause someone to cry for no reason.  

Today was a beast of a day at work.  One thing after another was going wrong.  I was able to leave today knowing that I resolved all of the issues I got today.  I left early today to get my allergy shots and these bitches are really starting to hurt after a year and a half.  I think all my nerves are burning.

Alex is still kinda distant.  I'm not really sure what to do about him sometimes.  NYE left me wondering what the hell was wrong with him.  No tongue at midnight.  So disappointing.  He's been far away since.  I feel so alone sometimes.  I wonder what he thinks?
