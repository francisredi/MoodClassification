I don't feel very well tonight.  I don't know why but I'm quite depressed.  My girlfriend told me once that my journal updates are often (always?) depressing, or something to that effect.  Sadly I guess this is going to be another one of those.  I've been sitting here listening to music and feeling rather melancholy...one of the songs I was playing had the line "Please hand me the bottle, I think i'm lonely now" in it, and though I'm not particularly lonely, it seemed like a good idea to start drinking.  I figured that would cheer me up a bit but it hasn't; now i'm just slightly buzzed and depressed.  So, for some reason, I thought I should update my journal even though I don't really have anything interesting to say.  Its giving me something to do.  I could talk about my day a bit, but I don't really feel like it.  I actually don't think I should post this entry, i feel like i'm talking without actually saying anything and i'm trying to decide if i should click the X in the corner or not.  I guess i'll click the update button before I change my mind...maybe i'll just go drink some more disgusting cheap rum....I'd really like a glass of good scotch right now, Johnny Walker Blue Label on the rocks would hit the spot.  Oh well, until next time...
