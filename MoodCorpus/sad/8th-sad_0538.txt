Im so fucken depressed
Ive been on an emotional roller coaster lately. I was on cloud 9 yesterday. Now I feel im in the shitter. So I told Andres it's over. Like there is nothing he can do or say to change my mind. He wanted to drive up here. I told him not to waste his time because that wont change my mind. I know he would change for me...but I dont want to wait anymore. I dont want to do this anymore. Im so damaged from this relationship that I cant imagine how hard it would be to trust any man (if there is any) in the future. I did this for me. For my sanity. For my mind, my heart. I did the right thing. I was finally brave enough to do it. I had to. I feel free in a sense. I feel like Ive needed to do this. I feel like I can concentrate in school now. I feel sad because yeah we had good times, but relieved because I dont want to ever cry the way that Andres made me cry ever again. I hope that I give a good message for Mya, that she will eventually understand why I did what I did. Im scared that she will be angry at me forever. I hope not. I hope she understands I did it for me, and us. To be fair. I cant look back now. It's too late.
