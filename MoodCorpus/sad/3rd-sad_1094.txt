The infamous PINK cigarette!
Yes me zane and dave found the infamous pink cigarette...its like all hiddin away. "Pink Dreams" my new found love!...they're just A-mazing!!...unlike some...hmmm my days been ok. I was practically miserable the whole time...well up until I guess now. Im feeling alittle better. I told Zane the deal I had in my head and whats been going on with me down to detail lastnight. And I don't know I'll probly keep my deal because it did happen but I don't know Im just so fustrated. And I can't really explain it. and for some odd reason Im reaching tears. They'r coming, im not even sure exactly why but they are. Im just sad. Yeah this say's alot more than I thought it ever would've been or gone. And I never wanted this but it's happened and I don't know how to feel exactly. Just depressed I guess for actually letting myself get this way. I told myself I wouldn't let it get this far because it would hurt and I was SO rite! I hope this doesn't happen when I see him. I hate crying in front of people, it just doesn't happen to me. The guy from Marathon lastnigth at 1.30am was just A-mazing though. He's good at reading people and said I looked sad not on the outside but he said on the inside. I guess just thinking about that Kind of catches me and makes me think well some people are awesome and I love them
