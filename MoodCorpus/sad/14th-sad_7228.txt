Depressed
  I don't know why I'm so depressed as of this moment. Is it because, I feel that Tenchi doesn't find me attractive? Or is it that this job didn't call me back yet? I took a fucking drug test for it; moreover, I definitely know I will pass. However the personnel manager said that they haven't received the results yet. hmmm......I hate waiting for things! I feel like some force in the universe is making me fail or I am doing it myself subconsciously. But why? Is it I am feeling disappointed that I am not going to school and I feel I am falling behind? Is it because of this I am taking out on Tenchi with my whining? He said a smart ass comment to me last night and I wanted to put him through the wall. Now this isn't me. I am usually mellow and don't give a shit about what he or anyone else thinks but things are really getting to me now.....I feel like and idiot...this morning for example, I was doing a Sodoku and Tenchi was watching but I fucked up on one box and Tenchi said he should get me a pencil for these things I wanted to stab him somehow with the pen in my hand....hmmm also I was flipping out because I had a nine day period and was pissed about that too.
I went ahead with the sponsor thing too got my awesome Icons up ^______________^
