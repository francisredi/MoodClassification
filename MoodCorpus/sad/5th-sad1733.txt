not getting any better
still cant enjoy the same things that i used to enjoy. its so depressing to me that i sit infront of the tv alone everynight. or infront of the computer alone everynight. at least when i'm at school i dont feel as alone. i've been alone my entire life, i'm tired of that. its true. i've become addicted to writing in my livejournal about every other day. thats how sad i feel all of the time. when i'm at school i dont need to write in here unless i'm having a really bad day, but i've had a bad or sad day just about everyday since i left the 'boro a month ago. it just sucks that everything in lovely robinson is closed by nine, and i'm too young to go to the bars to just have a drink. i hate this. i will admit that i'm excited about going to all the museums with pday and nikker tomorrow. i havent seen them in a month and i think it will make these last few days go a little bit faster. i feel like i've spent an enternity in unhappiness. i feel as each day has gone on that my feelings of saddness have gotten to be worse. if there was anywhere that i could be right now it would be the 'boro.
