a week from today is my 22nd birthday. is it extremly obvious that i'm gonna be one of those people that get all depressed on their birthday. this is the first time that haven't been ecstatic for a birthday. because i'm 22. what the hell have i done? i've half assed my way through life. i haven't been anywhere or seen anything. i haven't done one single thing that i'm proud of. i don't make enough money to live on my own without working 7 days a week. i want to be good at something. i want to feel like someone. i want to look at my future and see more than just ray. i want to proud of myself. i want to happy with my life. but what the fuck do i have to happy about when my life has been exactly the same for the past 3 years? it's almost like i never went to school at all. i paid a butt load of money to work at a job for 11 dollars a hour and have no benefits. another thing that bothers me is that ray has this amazing dream about being a teacher and changing kids lives. my only dream is him. how sad. how weak. how depressing. i really wish i could start my life over. it's almost like i'm waiting for life to punch me in the face. for some reason i feel like i'm running out of time. 

i know i want to to back to school. but i can't go to school and work 7 days a week. i cannot live 2 more years with my parents. i guess i'm just waiting for ray. i wonder when i'll stop hating my life. i feel like i'm nothing. and i don't know what to do...

this is sick. i'll stop now.
