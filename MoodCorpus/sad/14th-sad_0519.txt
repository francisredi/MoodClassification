Well, I've been lying to myself. 
I've tried really hard to get excited about stuff, and keep up appearances. But as I sit here at 8:49 on a Tuesday, (Jordy has gone to her grandparents house) I'm pretty damn depressed. 

I'm eating hamburger helper. And chocolate chips.... without the cookie. 

I just really hate my birthday, because I start thinking about all those years my parents ignored it. I know that's weak, and stupid, but I hate this time of year. 

I tried to be lame, and get preoccupied and think about pinatas, but I'm mostly lonely. Which is also dumb because these days I feel like I have thrity friends at any given moment. It's okay to call me up. (Yeah I know I decline most of the time anyone calls me because I am restricted to particular days and time slots, so I guess I did that to myself.) 

I don't know why I feel so down. I mean I know why, but it's stupid too. 

I think I should probably do something mindless like play Mario Brothers. 

Some days, you have everything you could ever want, but lacking stable companionship gets to you. I need a partner in crime.
