single awareness day
i felt so alone today, i mean everyone was there for me but i just feel like im being erased from the person i care about the most. i know i keep ranting on about this break up, but we went out for so long and i really do love her...more than anything. i try not to talk to her anymore, because i know it would hurt me too much, i just want to call her and scream how much i love her but i cant do that anymore. so i have to take a back seat role and watch as i am slowly erased from her life, watch as everything about me is destroyed, watch as  i sink into obscurity and loneliness. i was so alone today, i saw girls walking the halls with flowers and i wanted to scream. i hate this feeling so much, im trying to live with it, but i hate it. i hate feeling like i dont matter to the one person that i want to matter the most to. i can be normal during the day, but at night it just feels so weird not having that special someone to talk to. i dont want to be hated, i want to be loved by that special someone again. today was really bad, especially since i had a really special evening planned for the occasion. im sorry for all the depressing entries, i just need somthing to tell how i really feel. i really cover it up at school, because i just dont want to bring that sort of behavior there. if anyone cares to try and offer advice or whatever please feel free. happy single awareness day or valentines day if your so lucky. 

a very lonely ~Eric~
