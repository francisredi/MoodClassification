Sad news, Student Death on Campus
So by now everyone has heard. I wasn't there, but when I first heard about it I thought "Wow, he will have a hard recovery." Somehow because I didn't know him I thought he would be fine. He was detached from me so it wasn't something that was real.

But when I heard he was dead, in the middle of my show, I thought of Ja. And I think it was hard for Mac Wilson, the Station Director, to tell Megan and I that he was dead. Because Mac knew Ja died and what that meant for Megan. I don't know if he knew Rick Rose, but he looked very upset, so did Matt. I wanted to give both of them a hug, but I turned to Megan instead. Suddenly the show didn't seem so fun anymore. And all the songs seemed wrong. Some of them were perfect though. That's KUMM for you.

But I am angry. This never should have happened. And everyone who was there is to blame. (Not the crowd, but) The players, the person who brought the sledge hammer, the coaches who most certinly knew about it ahead of time, and the police who stood back and watched. Because of them a person is dead. Who thought this would be a good idea? Yesterday a 1,000 people watched a young man come to his death. On a football field.
What ever happened to "it's just a game?"

To everyone who knew him, I am so sorry.
And I'm for those of us who never will.
