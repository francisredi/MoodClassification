...i miss me...
i've read and heard so many bad gossips about me. some are those saying that i've changed. well, basically yes, i had, and will, only that, i should know my limits, and the part of me that i would like to change. people do change, i tell you. i'm not going to deny that i did. i did change. thus, i also have to think, if i did change for the better me, or the worst.first thing's first. my grades. i've failed all my quizes in one quarter. that part was okay, but the bad part was me, feeling nothing about it, completely blank, and totally careless. i remember the childhood days when i would even tell my parents (with smiling face) that i'm part of the honor roll and that i'll be accepting an award on our Recognition day. it's sooo sad that i've learned to love the stupid, dumb, bobo, and tamad me. it's sooo sad because when i think about other people, saying that being 'intelehente' is such a very good impression to everyone, i get depressed. though, getting depressed and getting persevered has an expiration date with me. those perseverance and discipline would only hold long for at most, 3 months.next, is the war-freak-slash-no-fearing me. well, yes, i admit it, sometimes i really do like it. i love laughing at other people's mistakes. and i, surprisingly, even tried to practice parinigs to other people, which was soooo not me years ago. i've heard some people say that i've suffered hydrocephalus (lumalaki ang ulo) and stuff like that. i don't know, maybe i really am, mayabang, feeling, and all those nasty adjectives you could throw at me. sometimes, i wouldn't even care if i've been told all the swear words existing in the&nbsp;human vocabulary, all i care are the things that i, myself, is thinking about.maybe, in time, i would learn how to change again the real, and better me. i hope that that change would be for the better. good thing, i have friends, and family, who'd always check on me everytime i'm turning into another monster me.
