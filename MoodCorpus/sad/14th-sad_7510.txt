lost
why is my first instinct always always to run away as soon as something makes me feel awkward or unhappy?

I feel like I am such a drifter, I come in and out of people's lives without really making any impact at all, hell, alex went straight from living with me to being married and in love.  That shouldn't make me sad, but even more, I am sad that I never saw anything worth being in love with in that relationship.  And the ones I do want never see anything in me, which really seems karmically just but it still makes me sad.

I just want something tangible, I have been running away and wasting time for so many years.  I think a problem when everything comes easy is that you end up taking everything for granted, and I like the people in my life right now and I don't want to lose them just cause it's easier for me to find something else and not deal with change or anything that makes me uncomfortable.  It's my nature to run, it always has been, but I don't want to do that anymore.  I don't know though, it sometimes seems like it's what's best for everyone involved.  It's so much easier to never get attached, but I think it's too late for that now...
