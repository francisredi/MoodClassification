Lame
Today I started alright, got to go home and work for my mom and play with Jaelyn. I took her to go get some eggs and rasberries and we stopped by McDonalds to get her a happy meal. She fell asleep on the way back. Man is she adorable. But yeah, valentines day is WAY over rated and is just a way for companies to put fear into people to not spend their time alone on this day and spend their money to get a significant other. That has ruined this day for me...oh well. I got a small hard cookie from Bess Hultgren with a nice note that said I was a nice guy and that I smelled nice...ok cool now I know I smell nice at least...haha. And Brittany Barnett gave me two pieces of candy, that was nice of her. And then to top off my night I got a sweet note from Kit Rose saying happy valentines day I Love you. As a friend...haha. That was nice, so that was nice with some pieces of candy. For me this year I just wasn't feeling the love and I really didn't care about getting anything, but I admit it did make me feel happier when I did get the things I got. I did end up getting steph some candy and three roses even though I didn't want to give in to this stupid day of spending money and giving businesses out there what they wanted...money. Oh well, you can't be perfectly strong against everything in life. I played a little hockey tonight against the high school, we won 8-1 but I mean with the guys the college has it isn't a big deal, we have some rediculously sick players. It wasn't that much fun but it was somewhat fun. Now I am here to do a lot of hw and then go to bed. Goodnight and hope you had a happy valentines day to your likings.
