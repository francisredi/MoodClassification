breaking the girl
I'm out of everything and boredom overcomes. I'm sitting in my living room, going more insane with every passing moment. A dangerous combination of jealousy, loneliness and severely boring boredom pulses through my veins and causes me to lose it all. I black out and fall into a pile of my own waste. My thoughts, my hopes, my ideas surround me in what appears to be nothing but a graveyard for the prematurely deceased. I push them aside in an attempt to gain ground and create something new, but new isn't as new as I thought and I am brought back to the same old shit pile again and again. My face is pushed deeper into this trash. The straw in my mouth falls to the ground when I tell you myself. I wrap my body in words and hand them to you, but the scream of your eyes knocks me on my ass and I run for cover. Your judgmental, hypocritical shriek frightens me, it's not so easy for me to show you what you have to see. I turn to a friend, a familiar face, but as I look for something to comfort me, it melts and floats away on the wind. It never was. Just a lie. Nothing. I thought I had something but I was in fact mislead down the wrong path and now am lost in this wilderness of loneliness. Emo fucking shit spews forth from my mouth, too much, too fast. I drown. Fuck.
