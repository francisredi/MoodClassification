Day Of Defeat
The Evilgenie Speaks!

You ever have one of those days were it feels like every five minutes some one is beating you down with a bat emotionally? A day were it never quite stops raining. The sun peeks out from behind the clouds once and a while and then cowardly hides behind a dark cloud like it knows that today is a shitty day and that it cannot shine its shiny rays of happiness. A day in which you wanna punch everyone in the face, excluding Sarah of course. She and I shared a day like this today. I wont go into details on what made it so terrible and gloomy but as much as it was, I found it also cleared my head a bit. I've been a selfish asshole lately. I really feel I have done a terrible job of being there for Sarah. More so then other days, all I wanted to do today was to satisfy my needs. What I wanted to do. But in a relationship there is no "I". You have to come to a mutual agreement on what there is to do. Otherwise the relationship will not work. I keep finding myself going back to my old lazy ass ways again and I hate myself for it. I just get so frustrated with myself that I just cant barely even talk about it...I feel like crap. All I wanted to do today was sleep. Which is..unhealthy...I know.

Poor Kuro is going to the vet tomorrow to get spaded. Tomorrow is her turn to have a crappy day. Although I could never really wish my type of crappyness on anyone. Not even if they deserve it. No. Its reserved for me!
