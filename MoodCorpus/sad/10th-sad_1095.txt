J Pop Dance Is Totally Flop
I spent $8 to waste my night feeling dazed, depressed, and bored.  I could have stayed at home and done that for free, and with inflicting less emotional trauma on myself.  I don't know why i do this kind of stuff to myself.  For about half the time i was there i was acting all cheery and ditzy cuz i didn't know what else to do.  And i was trying to be all nice to John and karma kicked me in the ass, once again, by him finding someother girl to make out with dance and then us going to get coffee with us.  I haven't eaten anything proper all day, i feel very nausious, and i feel very very emo.  And when i wasn't feeling depressed, i was bored.  I spent an hour lying on the bars of a banister. Just lying there, i found a spot to balance on and just lied there.  I feel so gross.  UUUUUUUUGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHH......ugh. I just wish i wasn't so stupid to think that he acctually liked me. And i don't know why i wanted him too.  I mean i have kevin.  I just..... i don't know... I hate being so emo, but i can't help it.  There were only 2 things good about the dance. 1)I managed to keep a hershy kiss wrapper in my ear all night and 2) We got to watch Conrad get kicked out cuz he was drunk.  We'll the moral of tonight is "being sober sucks big time!"
