Hi there, I'm depressed.
Hello anyone who might accidentally stumble across this page!  I am in an incredibly somber mood at the moment.  Got turned down by yet another girl I like this afternoon, (rejection #6 since 2003)!  But you don't care about any of that.  To sum it all up, I am doomed to die a virgin, unless I become either A. bisexual B. attracted to fat, ugly middle-aged women, or C. raped by fat, ugly middle-aged women.  Or if the people I can actually stand just randomly start feeling unexplained attraction towards me.
To provide anyone who really gives a f**k with info, here's a brief description of me:
-I'm not in this bad a mood usually, it's just that my sense of reality is on the stronger-than-needed side, today.
-I have been playing the violin for the last 12 years (since I was 3,) though somehow it seems like the first 5 or 6 years didn't really make a difference against the people at my school who started in 4th grade.
-I have never been on a date in my entire f**king life, never been close to having a girlfriend, although it hasn't really bothered me all that much until today.  
Sometimes I wonder what the hell love really is, kind of like a traded slave child wondering what electricity is.  He's seen electronics used by his masters, possibly even used some in his work, but god forbid never operated a light switch, forbidden to own electronics of his own, let alone come to understand how any of it works.  I, the slave child, have repeatedly jumped at this fence, trying to escape the fate of life as a total loser.  All I learned was that eith each successive failure, the 600-volt wires hurt just a little more.  And still, the pointless hormones within me act up on a regular basis, driving me to keep jumping at the fence like some kind of ADD lemming.  Ever since reading 1984, I've thought of human emotions as some kind of vestigial organ from our evolutionary past; though they really serve no purpose in today's society, benefit us in no way other than small amounts of pleasure every now and then, but hey, when you're not a loser like me, it can be pretty swell.  So I'd just like to say, if you're a girl out there who might want to help this emotional wreck of a human, maybe you'll find something worth saving within him.  Until then, I think I'll go try to slit my wrists...
