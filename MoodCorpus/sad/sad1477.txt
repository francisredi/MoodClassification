50, 100, 200, 500... Claire Jordan
So I'm soooo tired yet sooo awake!! So last night... I cried A LOT... screamed A LOT... was confused A LOT... and was sooo EXCITED!!!  We had our swim banquet last night and Jenny gave me the scrapbook that she has been working on/talking about forever, and I cried reading it, I  was okay (somewhat) until i got to the last three pages, where she had asked Kathryn, Laura, and Bekha to write me a note and while i was reading them i basically couldn't stop crying. I'm so sad that they are gone now.  Then I turned to the last page and Jenny had written me a note and that made me even sadder.  Then I missed Erickson's speech about me, and was really confused when I got most improved, and didn't realize he was talking about me, so that made me sad.  Then Taryn and I got captains which was SUPER exciting and then we took a ton of pictures and cried A LOT more.  It was sad that Laura was balling I wish she didn't have to leave, I will miss her soooo much.  Just like I will miss arguing with Kathryn and dancing in the moonlight with Bekha.  My best swim year comes to a close with plenty of wonderful memories and plenty of wonderful new friends!
