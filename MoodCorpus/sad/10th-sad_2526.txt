What if you should decide, that you don't want me there by your side.
Perhaps your right Stephy, I went to go make my dad's lunch and I started crying, I mean I wasn't even really thinking about anything in particular. Then I did it again while talking to Todd, he asked me how I was and I said i was depressed and he told me he was so sick of my negativity towards life, of course that bothered me a little bit but then I just started crying again. I mean I'm kind of thinking about things in passing, I usually start crying cuz I'm totally focused on what makes me sad but I wasn't, not those times. I haven't wanted to cut though, just don't have the urge.

I'm behind in my reading for geography, so thats like what? 40 pages that i need to read on a subject I dont really have any interest in. I didn't even study really for the little two point quiz we have. I just keep putting everything off. I'm supposed to be doing my Bus Law work, but so far I've only read the question. Good thing I'm only taking for classes I guess. At this point I'm almost tempted to just leave when the semester is up, just go visit my bf or someone that will make me happy for a bit. I wish I had the nerve, I'd probably just end up leaving w/o telling. Talking is something I could not handle. It bums me out because my credit line could so cover the cost of the trip.
