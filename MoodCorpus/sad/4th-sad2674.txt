imatrendy S.O.B.
welp. i must say this is getting pretty trendy but who cares. well this is where i ramble on about how emo i am. Lets just say i had one of the crappiest new years ever. so basically, i was at misha's appt. and i had invited a guy over that i actually really like, to come over for the celebrations. I end up getting really really really drunk and he shows up and im standing there like a fucking asshole making out with this other guy. i feel so fucking shitty and im not going to be drinking like that for awhile..i had like 4 shots of everclear, and i chugged some SoCo somewhere in between those shots. i was so shitty. and i regret it because now that guy that i once had a chance with is not even talking to me for now. It's only been 2 days but i feel like its been longer. i seriously can't stop thinking about how fucking stupid i was for doing it. i know it was completely my fault and i don't know what to do because ive never been in a situation like this before. i just hope somehow he will forgive me and things will be back to normal again...but of course life just doesn't always work out the way you want it to. 

god im fucking stupid.
