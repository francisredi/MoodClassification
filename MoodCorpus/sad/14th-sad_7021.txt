Poor
I just looked at my finacials to see what I can spend over the next few weeks on Wedding things.  Now I am so depressed I could cry.  I worry Ben will hear me and come back out here.  I have been so emotional for weeks.  What am I going to do.  I feel like I will never get ahead.  How did I get so behind?  I feel like such a failure.  I can't even get up off my fat ass to make it to the school to get set for summer class.  Why am I so lazy.  Why do I feel so bad.  This is crazy.  I need to get my shit set straight.  I need to work more.  I am gonna have to call the dog store and have them give me hours next week.  I don't want to work there right now. I have to much going on.  Ben cleaned today.  It looks nice, it smells good in here too.  I hopefully just smoked my last cig for a while. There will probaly be Marlbro Man posts to follow in the next few weeks.  I have an old body, but I am young.  Why am I so fat?  Why am I sick?  I am having a pity party and I should be doing that home work that needed to be started days ago.  Tom and Katie had their baby.  Yet another fucked up kid for this fucked up world.  I need to seel things on ebay to make some cash.  I have that watch from tim that I can seel.  Perhaps that is what I will work on instead of the sleep that my body desperatly wants.
