Remembering my place, or, you stupid girl
I was chatting with beth, and i asked her if shane (and thusly tim) was still talking about them moving out of state. it turns out that he had mentioned it only a few days ago. 
it's time for ambyr to turn introspective. 

when did i allow myself to care this fucking much? didn't i say i would never let a man, screw that, ANYONE make me get like this? 
i recall, in a much earlier diary entry... must have been about a year or so ago, that I felt like i was just waiting for the bus to come and run it all over... destroy this new found elation that I have began to experience. and stupid me, i let myself get reeled in. yeah, hell yeah, OF COURSE it's been great this past month plus. idiot that i am, i thought it was BECAUSE of our big talk that things got so much calmer. what do they say, quiet before the storm, the beautiful sunset before opressive darkness... of course it's beautiful right now... that's the way it works. 

i'm not upset at him, of course... he has to find his own happiness and if i'm not part of that, i can't blame HIM for that. but i let myself forget all the shit that i've gone through, all the shit others have put me through. i just forgot and smiled at him and just let it be. stupid girl.

i think i just might drink alone tonight...
