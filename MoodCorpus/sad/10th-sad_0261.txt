things are so fucked up
I hate the way I've been feeling lately. & it's not all my fault either, but it also is because I let shit get to me. I feel like the only reason I'm here (alive) is to be treated like everyones venting machine. I get talked to by so many people about what's wrong in their lives or I get all of peoples anger taken out on me. & I'm sick and tired of it, but I feel trapped; because in all reality I AM! I will be the first person to ask what's wrong because I hate seeing people upset, but only a few actually care what's also wrong with me.

The other day I went to the guidance councler about some stupid fucking grade and he said I look happy. Atleast people can't see past my mask and fake smiles. I know some people come to school all "depressed" but then don't want to talk about it. If something is wrong then don't let others know or they will bother the shit out of you until you tell them whats wrong. But then there are other people who smother the shitttt out of you and it's just like GO AWAY! Shit like that is so fucking annoyinggggg!

"..tear out her heart, and leave her in pain
I never found out how she survived all of the sadness and pain kept inside
I never found out how she could lie with a smile on her face,
and the scratches she'd hide.

Down on her knees, she wept on the floor - this hopeless life she wanted no more
Dead in her mind and cold to the bone - she opened her eyes and saw she was alone
She never found out how much I cried - the rope so tight on the night that she died"
