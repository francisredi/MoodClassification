Auld Lang Syne
Why do I always get so sad on New Years Eve? Seriously, what is this bull shit? I mean even at the *amazing* parties Caitlin used to have (and what came of them...... *holds hands over her head like a halo*) I still was all sad and mopey and sad and depressed inside. But WHY? Why am I sad? Its just another year ending, whats so tragic about that? I dunno, but something is. I don't mean to be trite and what not and go on about how I feel my youth is lost and yet I still haven't fully embraced adulthood, but its what I feel like. And really, what do I have to look forward to? Granted I'm uber excited about my birthday this year cause I'll be 21 but like bleeeeeeeh. What is it about Dec 31st that makes me want to put a gun to my head? I don't know. At least I'm optimistic and all happy about this New Years cause I'm spending it with Josh (yay) and I get to have my long awaited new year's kiss (and one NOT from my mother *vomits*) anyway, my lover has returned. I hope you all are having a fun, safe and "somewhat sober" new years. Much love!!!!

Hear you me.
