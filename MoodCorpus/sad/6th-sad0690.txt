So ya today or should I say yesterday has been/was a pretty good day. 
We had our 1st and 2nd block exams that was a joke I pretty much failed them both because im stupid. 
After skool me and Eash went to Tim Hortons and some old man was all like "Halloweens not over yet" and then he came and sat like 3 seats away so after everything we said we added because halloween isnt over yet lol.  It was funny tho because we were leaving and I was going slow and Eash was all like your slowww and then was like are you going slow because Halloween isnt over yet? it was so funny... Dumb old people.
Then we went to the mall and on the way out i was serenading Eash with a little queen lol.  
then we came back to my house and I got ready for work and we listened to some good ol' Jeffree star lol. 
work was ok I was alone by 7 so I was busy all night trying to make sure I got everything done before closing.  Some lady made me shave 1 lbs and a half of ham I was very angry because shaveing it is really hard to do and its hard work for meeeeee. 

So today I miss my aunt a lot :( not that I dont miss her everyday or anything but lots more today because while me and Eash were driving GnR's knockin on heavens door came on and it was her favorite GnR song.  Infact that was the song playing when I first heard them.  While I was driving with my aunt. I miss her so much she was the best aunt ever :(   not to mention she was the only family on my moms side that we had left because none of the other people keep in contact with us and or live in another state.  She shouldent have died she was like the nicest person ever.  Stupid fucking cancer :( 

Well im done I dont want to make myself cry or think to much about it or ill never fall asleep and I cant take nyquil tonight or I deffinetly wont wake up tomarrow for skool :( 

on a good note my period is not officially over with! thumbs up to that shit right there.
