Does anyone realize at just how pointless so much in this world is? Has it occured to some people that its not just about themselves, its about everyone around you, it's about the people who see you everyday, and the people who only talk to you once a year. Does anyone truly know what it means to be selfless and to have the want for everyone else to care about everyone around you as much as you care for them? Has it ever occured to some people that the world doesn't revolve around them and what they do? Have they matured enough thru the course of their lives that 99% of them will leave some sort of mark on every single person they'll ever meet? Do they truly realize that? Does it take a couple brushes with death to make them understand just how many people truly would be saddened if you weren't there anymore? Well guess what. I have had a couple brushes with death, or with something where i could have easily been killed. am i the only one who can care for something so much that i'd be willing to take away their pain and their sorrow and their anguish at life for them. (thats not a biblical refernce, i'm not religious and i'm not pretending to be) Do i care too much for the people i care about? is that it? or am i just another bleeding heart romantic who longs for everyone around him to just realize where he's coming from with everything he does. There's a lot of things in life like that though. Stuff you do, but don't want to do, and stuff you don't want people around you to do. Granted, it won't stop them from doing it, no matter how much it breaks my heart to see them doing that. i'm not the kind of person who will just say 'no' to anyone. i'll let you do it until you either get sick of it, or the nostalgia of it wears off, or what-have-you. i won't stop anyone from jumping off a bridge, i'd just say to them '"go and jump, but remember that once you go, you can't come back. once you cross that simple plain of nothingness, there won't be anything to hold you up anymore, and i won't jump after you to try to save you, i'd just end up in the same situation as you." I would try to talk them back down, or talk some sense into them, and explain that the 30 secs, or 5 mins, or however long you're doing it is going to affect the rest of their lives, no matter what they may think. I may only be 19, but i don't feel my age. I feel older, could it be because of all the abuse i've done to my body over the past 13 years of hockey? could it be all the times i've inflicted pain onto myself just so i could tell a friend i know how something feels?&nbsp;Is it because i only allow myself to get 3-4 hours of sleep on&nbsp;nites i feel guilty for something i did to someone, is that a fair punishment? to make myself pay for the wrongs&nbsp;could it be that i'm just a wimp? that i'm not man enough to live up to what i'm supposed to be so i just run away from where i should be going? am i just a coward afraid of his own fate? i just wish someone&nbsp;would help me, i've never felt so alone at this in my life, i've never been so lonely inside. i haven't felt this sad in such a long time. why? someone please tell me why?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Staind - PleaseFailed to see I'm sick of this chances are you are oblivious to how I feel standing on your throne andI'm sure that I'm not alone, not alone, not alone.Tell me please, who the fuck did you want me to be? Was there something I couldn't see? Never knew thiswould be so political and please I'm still wearing this miserable skin and its starting to come fromwithin but it's obvious that doesn't bother you, so pleaseI didn't think that you'd sell me out now I know what you're all about. You might feel in control ofthings. But you're not holding all the strings. All the strings, all the strings. Swallow all your anger I've swallowed all my pride you used up all your chances to keep this all insidetell me please. So please don't be telling me its ok I don't buy all the shit that you say and quite honestly I'm fuckingsick of it so please if I cut off this nose from my face then I wouldn't feel so out of place but it stillwouldn't be quite enough for you, so please.
