I Wish I Were Dead
I can't stand it anymore this pain im going threw. Every time i love im told im loved to. Then my heart is ripped out and left laying on the floor. Ever time i think im going to have that happenies ever one is searching for life turns again and sends me more pain for me to endore. I feel useless i feel like the loser i always thought i was. But i guess thats what i get for wanting to be loved. I hate my life all i wanted was a family a wife and some kids to be loved no and till the bitter end. Instead I stand here alone onece again and i wonder to meyself Why do i try to live. All this pain just sweels inside and i hope that ill get over it. But why get over it so i can set myself up to be hart broken again. This is bullshit life really sucks perhaps the world be a better place if i was never born. Maybe im just a mistake something no one wanted i just happened. Well if thats the case let me know ill gladly end it here and now. Im tired of being depressed im tired of being alone. I just want to be love now and for ever more. Guess thats to much to ask i guess im a fool. I wish some one would just kill me and ened it now. I fear not death instead i welcome it. I rather die with honor but if i cant perhaps ill just die of a broken hart ill have that day when i have enough ill cut my self and smile ass the blood flowws down my body. Don't know when that day will be but i welcome it to. Let death find me. If i can't have a simple thing then why live at all whats the point.
