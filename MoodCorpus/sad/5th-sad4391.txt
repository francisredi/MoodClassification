i dunno
.....i dunno whats going on anymore i wish i were a kid again so i didn't have to deal with all this shit and all these fucked up emotions and crap i wish i didn't kno anything about self harm and suicide and all that stuff i just wish that so i wouldn't have to fight with myself over what ive done to myself in the past and what i countinue to do to myself time after time alot of people who self harm get worried about the scars i on the other hand im not gonna say i don't worry but it doesn't cross my mind and then when i wanna wear a tank top or shorts or both and my scars r visable i get very parinoid very very very parinoid and i tend to walk around trying to cover my scars with my hand but i kno that it doesn't hide them well so sometimes i just go ahh what the hell and i just let em be and i not that many people seem to notice THANK GOD and when people do if they give me shit about it i flip em off and walk away if they ask what happened i say its a long story and i haven't got time and i walk off in shame my scars cause me lots of pain grief guilt and shame and i hate them but then again they r a part of me a part i could never ask to have taken away because its part of who i am and everyone has scars from bike accidents and stuff like that and u kno everyone has emotional scars just mine happen to b visable from the outside in some respects i hate the fact that i cut but in others im like its part of me and its fine but mostly i think its part of me and its find the only time i find myself hateing it is when i get caught or when people think i do it for attention or when i get yelled at about it or when i get hospitalized for it or when im trying not to do it and i get triggered and i end up doing it anyways even tho when that does happen i feel bad for it happening i love it in the same way i love it it may be a addiction and all but i do love it and if its what i need to do its what i will do alltho don't take this as a cutting is ok self harm is ok thing cuz no i am not saying that cutting and self harm are not ok things but in my opipion u can not stop a self harmer from self harming ever if its what they do then u can't stop them u can help them if they wanna stop and they want the help and u help them then they can stop with time but u can not make a self harmer stop self harming and there is no magic cure and it will not happen over night it will take time and part of me has no clue why im typeing this stuff and another part of me is typeing it as information for the people who want me to stop self harming to have.....i will not get better over night i will probly never end up liveing compleate without self harm i will probly always have some sort of self harm in my life and as wrong as that is i will never b right and i will never b allright and im so fucking sick and tired of all these fucking emotions and shit that always fucking get in the fucking way of everything and im sick and tired of people thinking that i want attention when thats the last thing on earth i want i hate when people look at people who self harm as attention seekers when not there not the ones who r attention seekers do it then show it off and r like oo ooo ooo look what i did last night and blah blah blah but no im not people piss me off so fucking much i want people to stop and think maybe those who self harm just need friends who truely love and care for them no matter who they are and no matter what they like maybe they just need a friend or maybe they have alot of issues and i just wish people would look at all possiable reasons for one to be a self harmer and not just automatically say oh they just want attention or whatever cause usally thats the last thing they want. now im not telling anyone to just go out and cut urself and harm urself all u fucking want cuz im not cuz i truely hate to see people in paina nd i hate to see people sufering what im saying is if thats the way someone is that might not be changeable and people need to learn how to help and not make matters worse....
