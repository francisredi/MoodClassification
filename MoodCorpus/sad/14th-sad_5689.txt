It has happened, she has left.  I have finally realized that all I do is hurt.  Every relationship I have tried to keep has only ended in hearbreak.  It seams that nothing good ever comes from what I do.  I tried to have fun, keep her by my side, but I blew it and now she is gone.  Will she ever return?  I do not know.  All I know is that my heart has been broken once again and I do not know how well it will heal.  Everytime I have something good, it ends ubruptly, too soon, and leaves me with nothing.  I get stepped all over and do not defend myself or try to protect that which I love.  I am a coward and need some help.  Why must the world be so mean?  It has taken away my most precious possesions and left me alone.  I cannot fend for myself in this horrible place, I need someone by my side to said me.  I thot I had someone, several times in fact, but each one has left me alone and in pieces.  Will I ever find the right person?  I wonder what they would be like, and how long they would stay by me and tell me lies of how they love me when they really don't  Am I doomed to suffer with continuis heartbreak one after another?  I think I am, and tht is why tey have all left me for no reason I can see.  One after another, they pretend to like me, but on the inside they loth and detest me.  And after they have played their games with my heart, they just discard me like the piece of trash I feel like.  Why does this happen to everyone I love?  Am I ment to live forever with pain and heartache?  Why must this world be so mean as to take everything that means the most to me?  I believe it is time for me to accept my place in this world.  To cause pain without wanting to and to recieve pain in return.  This is my life, and this is how it might end.
