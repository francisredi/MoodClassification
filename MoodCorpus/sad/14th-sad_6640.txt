My brother...
Easter was okay, I got to see my mom for a little while.  But she kept getting sick because her stomach was still tender after her flu, otherwise she wasn't totally over it.  Made it really sad to have her leave so soon, but what can you do when you don't feel good?  Just go home and hope to feel better.

My brother was kicked out of the house by my mom and step-dad.  Drugs and drinking again. *screams* He needs to be put into a program, or he will wind up in jail or dead.  There is nothing else that can be done for him. *shakes head sadly* *cries*  I know things have been pretty tense with mom getting sick all the time..but that's no reason to go to drugs and alcohol again!  I guess he is hanging around the same 'buddies' that he did that crap with before.

My mom doesn't want to talk about it.  I don't blame her one bit, what can you do?  I had my cry last night over it.  I am so made at my brother, I really hate him sometimes. *cries*  He is such a bastard sometimes!  There is nothing anyone can do though, he has to hit bottom or die.  It is up to him...its just so very hard. *cries*  I feel bad for his little son.  My poor nephew...I am so depressed about it it isn't funny.
