I hope someone can help me
I guess you could say I am a "recovered anorexic" I never believed I was one and people tricked me into thinking there was something wrong with me for looking good. I have now become fat and I need to get help with people who know how I felt I need support from someone who wont worry about how healthy my diet is because this one pound a week plans are killing me I dont have a year to loose this extra weight but everytime i try not to eat I am criticized and told that i was disgusting before and I am growing up and getting curves I am sorry but fat is not pretty it is gross and I hate myself. I just need someone to help me get through starting a good diet again and when I say good I want results but i am so used to eating with big people that i cant loose this It is killing me and I feel that if i cant become small again I might die because i get depressed and now instead of not eating all I do is eat and all i want to do is feel better about my self. I have lost my control and I just want to gain it back. If any of you have ever felt the way I feel you will please reply and help me. I really need the support before i lose control over the one thing I always had control over. ANd now that I am 21 it is even harder with the drinking and bars if someone could help me with that too I would be so thankful
