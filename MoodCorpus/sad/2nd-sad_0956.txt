What needs to be done yet you hate yourself for doing it
What am I talking about? I'm talking about Acorn, my nearly four year old rat. He's had a full life, eaten almost everything I have, shared most of my breakfasts throughout his years, drunk tea with me, nicked choclate out of my mouth and stolen ice-cream off the spoon.

Thing is his back legs have gone, hes unhappy, frustrated and he spends most of his time sleeping now. I know it's time to take him to the vet but it still hurts. Even after the logical curcuits have kicked in and said that its the best thing for him now. I just wanted to spend this last yule with him you know, but he's turning his nose up at chocolate and for him thats when you know he's not himself anymore. He even had to think twice about banana! I mean he was the banana bandit, you had anything that even smelled of banana he'd be all over you for it, I do mean all over as well! Searching pockets and bags for the fruit of passion!! It's upsetting to see him get frustrated at himself when its not his fault, his minds okay but his body had let him down. So tomorrow or Wednesday he's going in and I'll be a wreck. I know he's just a little furry creature but he's filled my life with such joy and happiness it's going to feel empty for a while. So if I don't laugh as quickly as I used to or seem a little less than normal you'll know why. Saying goodbye isn't easy, even after all the times I've said it, I love him but i love him enough to let him go. 

So to those of you who've seen him as he was, a bouncy little brown ball of energy with bright eyes and a mischeivious streak a mile wide with intelligence to boot, remember him like that. He was and always will be one of a kind, a rat allergic to humans (he sneezed a lot around us), intelligent (he always knew when you were upset and came to sniff and groom you) and most of all I'll miss his little face in the morning waiting for breakfast.

Going to go now, see you all later.
