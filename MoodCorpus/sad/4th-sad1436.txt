I am teh suck
Kind of depressed today.&nbsp; Which sucks, because it's really amazingly beautiful out in a not possibly January sort of way.&nbsp; It's probably just that I'm worn to a nub with work issues and being sick (did I mention I spent two days this weekend running a fever?) and generally taking stock of what was a very mixed bag of a year.&nbsp; At any rate, C-Monster is driving me insane.&nbsp; The boy is dancing the Pogo on my very last nerve in hobnailed boots and has been since we got up this morning.&nbsp; Right now, I'm up in my study, ostensibly to clean it (which it needs, badly), but I don't feel like doing anything.&nbsp; However, it does have the advantage of being one place in the house where The Kidlet isn't right now.

Jane says I should go out and see a movie or something, but I don't feel like doing stuff alone.

And unlike most of the rest of the world, I have to go back to work tomorrow.&nbsp; As happy as I am with the way things have gone (barring a few minor issues), I'm sick of the place and really don't want to see it for another week or so.

On the plus side, Spike TV is showing Jackie Chan's "Armour of God", which I have never seen, believe it or not.&nbsp; Maybe that'll help.
