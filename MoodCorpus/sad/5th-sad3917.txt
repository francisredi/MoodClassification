So....
At 11:41pm, Saturday the 14th of January, I, Tarl, took out my eyebrow piercings.

I did it because one of them wasn't being held in with all that much skin anymore. And it was time I took them out so the holes could fill and heal and I can get them again sometime hopefully next month or the one after it. 

To be honest, I feel a great sense of loss without them. I have been generally depressed as of late, and I guess this probably wasn't the greatest of ideas at the moment as it seems to have only added to it rather than do anything else.

Oh, for those that want to know, today I got a "I just want to be friends" talk while at work. It went better than expected, but I sure am sick of getting them. It seems that the world just doens't want nice men in it, or perhaps it just doesn't want me. *shrug*

So I am looking forward to getting my eyebrow redone, though right now it's lumpy to beat all heck, which actually kinda creeps me out since you fun your finger along my eyebrow ridge and it's like WHOA!!! there's a HUGE lump there. (as there is two vacant tunnels through my skin mind you....)

So taking them out was somthing important to me. I miss them already and it hasn't been more than 4 minutes so far. Mourn my loss, but rejoice when I get them again. (and have to suffer the black eye that comes with them....) But for now, I miss them.
