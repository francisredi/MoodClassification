Every drawing that I drew was never ever as cute as you
Panic! at the Disco, The Academy Is..., and HelloGoodbye is on Wednesday.  For some reason I don't want to go anymore.  I mean, I can list reasons, but these reasons did not bother me before.  If I don't wake up super-psyched tomorrow, I'm giving Lauren my ticket and staying here.

I sort-of miss my family.  Not the crazy psycho part of my family, but my family when they're being cool.  I especially miss Michelle.  I can't live without my baby sister anymore!

I tried to start a picture tonight, but realized it was too late to start something.  I took a bunch of black and white pictures of myself acting stupid so I could draw a self portrait or two (or eight).  

Well, it's officially Valentine's Day now, and what's Valentine's Day without a single's rant about love?!  I'll tell you what it is, it's a cop-out V-Day, that's what it is.  So here goes: I am insanely jealous of every person who has it for someone else and every person who someone else loves.  So jealous that I could cry.  So jealous that I could just scream.  I feel like i always find someone who is wonderful that doesn't seem to notice me or just plain isn't interested.  I hope my luck will change soon.  

Now it is time to sleep and feel sad.  YAY VALENTINES DAY!
