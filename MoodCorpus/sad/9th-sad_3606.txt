I apologize for my last post last night...ya know, the one with no explaination. I wasn't in the mood to elaborate, so I'll say a few more things now.

Remember earlier when I made a post about ending a certain relationship with someone because things just wouldn't be good if I tried to keep it? Well, even though I said it, it was hard to really get rid of it. I still felt things that I wanted to leave, but after talking to a friend last night on AIM, I realize that it really is over. I have no chance. Never had. Never will have. There was nothing there for the other person, and no matter how hard I tried, nothing would change. A few choice words from my friend finally made me realize how much of a fool I am. So now my heart is broken, once again, and I feel so empty inside. I may thank you, friend, in the future, but right now I just need to be sad. I need to cry. I need everything to sink in and totally obliviate every thought of me ever having a chance. Once I have hit the ground, I can begin to pick up my shattered being and move on.

I also apologize to my friends at school. Sorry I didn't feel like talking today and making y'all sad. Though it was ok to be sad today since most of my friends decided not to come to school and left me all alone in class and at lunch. -_- *le sigh* I'm really tired. Didn't get much sleep last night due to nightmares. Oh yay. Now I don't want to go on a boat, lol.

And I'm a lot better, physical health-wise. Yay.
