I'm worried about him.  I miss him so much.  I feel like i'm going insane cause i'm all alone up here and wanted to go home but can't cause it snowed so nicole gets to watch Chelsea *BOOOO* and have brother and nicole spend the night with her...for those who dont know my brothers fiance is named nicole and my sister is named nicole...sorta wierd but anyways....its super cold up here and it sucks cause i go outside to smoke could smoke inside but chose to be nice to my rude roommate which isnt here and dont think she will ever come back YAY! i want to get rid of her but dont know if thats possible since i have a "NEW" suitemate and the beauty of it all is she is a freaking slop nasty i found dried puke and green peppers in my sink dont know if i posted this already or not losing my mind...well ill get off here if your on anyone on message me if ya want byes :) kisses and hugs baby I LOVE ROBERT SO VERY MUCH!!!
