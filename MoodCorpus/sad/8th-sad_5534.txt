No one has to read the following I just need an outlet:

There are just sometimes when everything you've been through your whole life suddenly hits you all at once and you just cant make it go away. I wish I had someone to hold me...right now...Fallon I miss you, Kyle I miss you, Travis; where are you to make me laugh? April I know you are going to say that it will all be ok and you are probably confused like hell right now but I .... I don't know A friend of mine was asking me about my family and what it was like growing up and I just poured my heart out to him (poor thing) and now I'm just sad and upset and I can't stop thinking about all the stupid things I've ever done and all the close friend's I've lost and all the pain my family has been through recently. Most of my family doesn't even know how much I hide from them emotionally. They have their own problems. I can't burden them with my trivial stuff when David's sick and Luke's truck got stolen. I think I'm gonna call my aunt tomorrow or Monday and see if I can meet with her and talk to her. She's really the only one in the family I feel close enough to that I can talk to and feel like she'll make it better just by listening you know. I know you are going to tell me that you are there for me to talk to but you have your own problems too. You've just had a mini crises with school and all and I don't want to burden you with all this and Liz you are sick and have way to much going on with school and stuff I don't want to burden you either. Please don't ask me anything right now either of you. When I'm ready to talk about it I will but right now I need to talk to someone in my family that I'm comfortable with. not my mom, not my dad, none of my brothers or grandparents, not even my godparent's (not that they've ever really been that much help). I know pretty much anyone that reads this will be confused but one day I will explain it all I promise. Just.... not right now. sorry everyone.
