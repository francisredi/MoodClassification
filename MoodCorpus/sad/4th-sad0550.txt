A Sad Sad Day
Today we put Brain's dad to rest. It was hard for my sweetie pie today & to be honest it was hard for me too...but I refused to let that show. I have been to numerous funerals in my day unfortunately, but this one was different from them all. This time I knew maybe 5 out of the hundreds who passed through the room. It was odd to be the outsider. I was the one looking in at the sad faces, trying to give warmth & condolences to those around me. I wasn't the receiver this time I was the giver & let me tell you I think it is more difficult on this side. What can you say to ease the pain. What can you do to make the hurt disappear. What can you give to fill the void of that lost loved one. I really wish they had a course for this kind of stuff b/c I need it desperately. 

Today I realized that time is to short. It is just to damn short!!! There are so many things that I want to do & so many places that I would like to go, but will I have time & even more importantly how do I start??? Grrrrr igfiusev iwdpfuv iwgefhpwejcfihwein... sorry that was me being frustrated!!! :( :( :( 

Maybe I will figure this out over a good nights sleep. Stay tuned internet land. Oh, & if you have any advice or suggestions I am more than willing to accept them at this time.
